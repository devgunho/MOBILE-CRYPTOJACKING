Alternatively, once discussion is already posted as public its visibility can be changed by either you or AppVeyor team using <strong>Make private</strong> toggle button on the right side bar.<li>When the private ticket is solved with solution provided and conversation doesnât contain any sensitive data (logs, IPs, passwords, etc.) we encourage you <strong>making it public</strong> so the solution could be easily discovered by AppVeyor users.</ul><h2 id=email>Email</h2><p>Whether itâs a sales question or a support request you can always contact us by email:<p><a href=mailto:support@appveyor.com>support@appveyor.com</a><h2 id=technical-updates>Technical updates</h2><p>Whenever AppVeyor service or build workers are updated we add a new entry to this feed:<p><a href=/updates/ >https://www.appveyor.com/updates</a><ul><li>Subscribe to receive Technical updates email notification on your <a href=https://ci.appveyor.com/profile>profile page</a>.</ul><h2 id=github-issues>GitHub issues</h2><p>See whatâs planned for development or what has just been delivered.
