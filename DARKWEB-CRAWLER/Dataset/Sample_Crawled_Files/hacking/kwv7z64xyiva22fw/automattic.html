				<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Automattic, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
</section><section id="who-we-are-and-what-this-policy-covers"><h3 >Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h3>
<p>Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone &#8212; from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises &#8212; to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open Internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (âGPLâ). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, vip.wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, akismet.com, simplenote.com, simperium.com, leandomainsearch.com, cloudup.com, longreads.com, and happy.tools);</li>
<li>Our mobile applications (including the WordPress mobile app for Android and iOS);</li>
<li>Our other Automattic products and services that are available on or through our websites (including WordPress.com plans, WordPress.com VIP, Jetpack, the WooCommerce Services Extension, Gravatar, the IntenseDebate comment management system, Akismet plans, Simplenote, Simperium, Cloudup, Longreads, and Happy Tools); and</li>
<li>Other usersâ websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy weâll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as âServices.â And if youâd like to learn more about which Automattic company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on Controllers and Responsible Companies.</p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>
<p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
</section><section id="creative-commons-sharealike-license"><h3 >Creative Commons Sharealike License</h3>
<p>Weâve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">Github</a>. Youâre more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. Also, if you do use the policy weâd appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.</p>
</section><section id="information-we-collect"><h3 >Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do soâfor example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
<p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Letâs go over the information that we collect.</p>
</section><section id="information-you-provide-to-us"><h4 ><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></h4>
<p>Itâs probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address along with a username or name, <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/wpcc-faq/">depending on the service</a> â and thatâs it. You may provide us with more information â like your address and other information you want to share â but we donât require that information to create a WordPress.com account.</li>
<li><strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or an âAbout Meâ description. Your public profile information is just that &#8212; public &#8212; so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction and Billing Information:</strong> If you buy something from us âa subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, aÂ <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/domain-registrations-and-privacy/">custom domain</a>, or some fun Longreads swag, for example â you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</li>
<li><strong>Happy Tools Information:</strong> If you are a Happy Tools user, you will provide us with information to make use of the Serviceâs features. For example, you might enter timezone and location information, company information, and contact information.</li>
<li><strong>Ecommerce Site Information:</strong> If you use our ecommerce Services to sell products or services to others through your site (including <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/store/">Stores on WordPress.com</a>, the <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-services/">WooCommerce Services extension,</a> or other purchases on WooCommerce.com), you will have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some of our ecommerce Services, provide your site URL. You may also provide us with information about your financial account to set up a payments integration, such as the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information.</li>
<li><strong>Content Information:</strong> Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in draft and published content (such as for your website or your Crowdsignal survey). For example, if you write a blog post that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet if you choose to publish the post publicly. This might be obvious to youâ¦but itâs not to everyone!</li>
<li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). For example, Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems on their site more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Communications with Us (Hi There!):</strong> You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question about your site in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="information-we-collect-automatically"><h4 ><i>Information We Collect Automatically</i></h4>
<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Servicesâfor example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack servicesâin other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted â[title of post]â at [time/date]). As another example, our <a href="https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/">WooCommerce Usage Tracker</a> tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, PHP settings, and other features for your site, along with information about your online store, such as the aggregate number of orders and customers. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/admin-bar/">Admin Bar</a> and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>
<li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating systemâs permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Stored Information:</strong> We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating systemâs permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile deviceâs camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.</li>
<li><strong>Interactions with Other Usersâ Sites:</strong> We collect some information about your interactions with other usersâ sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your âLikesâ and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example, <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/algorithms-search-and-recommendations/">recommend posts</a> we think may interest you. As another example, for Intense Debate users, we collect information about the comments you make while logged in to your account, and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and provide the information about your comments in your Intense Debate public profile.</li>
<li><strong>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitorâs computer, and that the visitorâs browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our <a href="http://www.automattic.com/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="information-we-collect-from-other-sources"><h4 ><i>Information We Collect from Other Sources</i></h4>
<p>We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/publicize/">Publicize feature</a>, we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p>
<p>We may also get information, such as a mailing address, from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (â¦but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our services.</p>
</section><section id="how-and-why-we-use-information"><h3  style="margin-bottom:20px;">How and Why We Use Information</h3>
</section><section id="purposes-for-using-information"><h4 ><i>Purposes for Using Information</i></h4>
<p>We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide our Servicesâfor example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, charge you for any of our paid Services,Â or provide essays and stories for your reading pleasure through Longreads;</li>
<li>To further develop and improve our Servicesâfor example, by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;</li>
<li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>
<li>To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition &#8212; for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain length of time;</li>
<li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our Services;</li>
<li>To communicate with you, for example through an email, about offers and promotions offered by Automattic and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on Automattic and our products (which you can unsubscribe from at any time); and</li>
<li>To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations (for example, through our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/algorithms-search-and-recommendations/">Reader Post Suggestions</a>), target our marketing messages to groups of our users (for example, those who have a particular plan with us or have been our user for a certain length of time), and serve relevant advertisements.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="legal-bases-for-collecting-and-using-information"><h4 ><i>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</i></h4>
<p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:</p>
<p>(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account &#8212; for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or</p>
<p>(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or</p>
<p>(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or</p>
<p>(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information &#8212; for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or</p>
<p>(5) You have given us your consent &#8212; for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our <a href="http://www.automattic.com/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
</section><section id="sharing-information"><h3  style="margin-bottom:20px;">Sharing Information</h3>
</section><section id="how-we-share-information"><h4 ><i>How We Share Information</i></h4>
<p>We do not sell our usersâ private personal information.</p>
<p>We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic), those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites (such as the extensions on WooCommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g. our <a href="https://automattic.com/cookies/">Cookie Policy</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/">Legal Guidelines</a>. Additionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers&#8217; (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies. For example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers. Please see our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/domain-registrations-and-privacy/">Domain Registrations and Privacy support document</a> for more details.</li>
<li><strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/#emergency-requests-from-government-agencieslaw-enforcement">may disclose information related to the emergency without delay</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your site through our Publicize feature.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Site Owners: </strong>If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with a site, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site. For example, if you leave a comment on a site that uses our Services (like a site created on WordPress.com or a site running Jetpack), your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment.</li>
<li><strong>Published Support Requests:</strong> And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="information-shared-publicly"><h4 ><i>Information Shared Publicly</i></h4>
<p>Information that you choose to make public isâyou guessed itâdisclosed publicly.</p>
<p>That means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your âLikesâ and comments on other websites, are all available to othersâand we hope you get a lot of views!</p>
<p>For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you havenât uploaded one, is your <strong>G</strong>lobally <strong>R</strong>ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar &#8212; get it? :). Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, will display with the comments and âLikesâ that you make on other usersâ websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Your Gravatar + public profile information may also display with your comments, âLikes,â and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account with us is the same as the email address that you use on the other website.</p>
<p>We also provide a âFirehoseâ stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it, publicly.</p>
<p>Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>
<p>Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>
</section><section id="how-long-we-keep-information"><h3 >How Long We Keep Information</h3>
<p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it &#8212; which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information &#8212; and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>
<p>For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automatticâs websites, such as the visitorâs IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automatticâs websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>
<p>As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days just in case you change your mind and would like restore that content &#8212; because starting again from scratch is no fun, at all. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</p>
</section><section id="security"><h3 >Security</h3>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
<p>To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/security/two-step-authentication/">Two Step Authentication</a>.</p>
</section><section id="choices"><h3 >Choices</h3>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit the Information that You Provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services &#8212; for example, paid, premium themesâmay not be accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Access to Information on Your Mobile Device:</strong> Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you do so, you may not be able to use certain features (like adding a location to a photograph, for example).</li>
<li><strong>Opt-Out of Marketing Communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
<li><strong>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</strong> At this time, Automattic does not respond to âdo not trackâ signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automatticâs websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automatticâs websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
<li><strong>Close Your Account:</strong> While weâd be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our Services :( :( :( :(, you can close your account (for example, <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/close-account/">here</a>, for WordPress.com accounts).Â Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above &#8212; for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="your-rights"><h3 >Your Rights</h3>
<p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the âGDPRâ), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you arenât able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us.</p>
<p>EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>
</section><section id="controllers-and-responsible-companies"><h3 >Controllers and Responsible Companies</h3>
<p>Automatticâs Services are worldwide. Different Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.</p>
<p>Depending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the controller of your personal data. Generally, the âcontrollerâ is the Automattic company that entered into the contract with you under the Terms of Service for the the product or service you use. In addition, Automattic Inc., our US-based company, is the controller for some of the processing activities across all of our Services worldwide.</p>

<p>Because Automatticâs Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use Information section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them, or ensuring they have signed up to the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">EU-US Privacy Shield</a>; or</li>
<li>In the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.</li>

</section><section id="ads-and-analytics-services-provided-by-others"><h4 ><i>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</i></h4>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Automattic and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.</p>
</section><section id="third-party-software-and-services"><h4 ><i>Third Party Software and Services</i></h4>
<p>If youâd like to use WooCommerce extensions that enable services provided by third parties, third party plugins, embeds, or other third party software or services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties. For example, some third party services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitorsâ, or customersâ) data, for example, via a pixel or cookie. Please note that if you use the third party service or grant access, your data will handled in accordance with the third partyâs privacy policy and practices. We donât own or control these third parties, and they have their own rules about collection, use, and sharing of information, which you should review before using the software or services.</p>
</section><section id="visitors-to-our-userse28099-websites"><h4 ><i>Visitors to Our Usersâ Websites</i></h4>
<p>We also process information about visitors to our usersâ websites, on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements. Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our users for their websites isnât covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage our users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information. If youâd like, you can also read more about the data we collect on behalf of our users in our <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</a>.</p>
</section><section id="privacy-policy-changes"><h3 >Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Automattic may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Automattic encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or the <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com Blog</a>, or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.</p>

I was born in England (where the rest of my non-immediate family lives) but moved to the states when I was 2 years old. We started in Minnesota, then moved to Florida, then the bay area of California in the span of 5 years. I grew up in a little town called Pleasanton, California (as pleasant as it sounds) before moving to Houston, Texas where I spent 18 years going to Middle School (Kleb), High School (Klien) and getting my associates degree at a Community college (Tomball Community College). <\/p>\n<p>After working as a bartender for a bit and finishing out my degree, I got my first real job opportunity at Hewlett Packard as a data analyst in a QA lab. Went on to become a team lead of their Software Quality Assurance team for their diagnostics software a few months later. I felt lost in such a big company and didn't fit in with the culture at all.<\/p>\n<p>After a year and a half there I got an offer from a friend to come work at a WordPress Hosting company called WP Engine here in Austin. So I packed up my bags and got engrossed in the startup \"cult\"ure and really fell in love with the people and places of Austin. Other than the heat, it's a perfect place for me.<\/p>\n<p>My WordPress experience at the time was creating a site for my webcomic I had been working on. My dream as a kid was to become a cartoonist, and after getting back into it about 5 years ago, I've been getting really good at my doodles.<\/p>\n<p>I spent the last 3 years (before starting at Automattic) at WP Engine doing tech support for a huge range of customers.  Towards the end of my time there, the startup culture had faded (at least on the support team) and I started getting burnt out on coming into work each day to a much less happy\/exciting environment after they implemented a quota system that drove out all of my favorite coworkers. Eventually I left the company as well. Through it all though, I never took out my frustrations on my customers EVER and was still very proud of the quality of support I was able to give. After leaving, I was able to step back and get some really good perspective on how my personal skills were tailored for customer support and why I should keep pursuing it and it's why I decided to become a Happiness Engineer<\/p>\n<p>In my spare time, I go to an artist meet up twice a week to hone my doodling skills. You can find my stuff on Tumblr or (better yet) Twitter:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/moegeemoe.com\/<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/richardjohnhunt<\/p>\n<p>I also do a YouTube Channel with my best bud MadHatter McGinnis (who works here with Automattic and recruited me) and two of my old coworkers at WP Engine. We do a Let's Play (We lay video games and podcast over them) show called ScrubBudz where we play classic games. I do all the art and half of the video editing for it. We've accomplished a lot over the past year and even had a booth at SXSW Gaming that was right next to Nintendo's booth... crazy to think about.

I grew up in a small town called Mazeikiai - the most notable fact about this town is the fact that a huge chunk of its population works at a nearby oil refinery.<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 15, I did my first attempts to do IT related work, like troubleshooting and fixing Windows issues, adding or replacing hardware etc. I was able to earn enough to go snowboarding once or twice a week during winter months. As it often happens at a young age, I didn't manage to keep up with growing competition and stay focused. Also I didn't quite enjoy the actual work.<\/p>\n<p>By the time I graduated from school, I had little idea what I want to do in life (besides snowboarding), so I went for Business Management and Administration degree in Klaipeda University.<\/p>\n<p>While studying, I tried a few jobs in completely different areas, but when the opening of a snowdome in Druskininkai, Lithuania, was announced in 2011 - I knew I had to be there.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after opening, in October 2011, I passed my exams and received an official certification of snowboarding instructor, which allowed me to work in our snowdome, as well as in Alps a few years later. Spending a lot of time strapped to a snowboard allowed me to become a local-level pro rider, and I did my fair share of competitions too.<\/p>\n<p>Few years later, I realized that being snowboarding instructor is a job for a few weeks or months a year only. I also realized there's more to life than just snowboarding, and I decided to pursue a career in IT.<\/p>\n<p>I didn't have any training in this area, and all my knowledge was self taught. I've spent a few months learning Java from Stanford online courses, as well as some Java for Android. <\/p>\n<p>After some time I started working at Western Union office in Vilnius as a Government Sanctions and Interdictions associate - even though this had little to do with IT. At the same time I was further deepening my IT knowledge - 3d modelling, indie game development, HTML and CSS. <\/p>\n<p>Later on, I worked as a Customer Success Manager at MailerLite - that allowed me to deepen my marketing knowledge, as well as get familiar with work in a successful IT company. <\/p>\n<p> SEO was also something I really enjoyed learning. I started experimenting with a WordPress membership site. Even though at some point I decided to give away my video tutorials for free - that experience helped me to get through a trial at Automattic, as a Happiness Engineer.<\/p>\n","image":"https:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7cf295febd74928fadbcf4502b3f2b08","latitude":54.6871555,"longitude":25.2796514},{"name":"Deric Lee","role":"Happiness Engineer","bio":"","image":"https:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a7e3f378735154ac8fc49653ea0a3777","latitude":3.139003,"longitude":101.686855},{"name":"Don Lair","role":"Customer Marketing Wrangler","bio":"<p>I'm a marketing veteran who has been poking around the internet since the mid-90's, back when I frequented an Orlando BBS called Infinite Space.

<h4 class="howwework">HOW WE WORK</h4>
<p><strong>Choose your own adventure</strong> Â· Everyone works from the location they choose. Weâre spread out all over the world in more than 60 countries. We track about 70 percent of our projects on <a href="http://p2theme.com/">P2-themed</a> WordPress.com blogs, 25 percent in private chat rooms, and the rest on Slack. Because of the geographic variance, weâre active 24/7. We care about the work you produce, not just the hours you putÂ in.</p>
<p><strong>Coming on board</strong> Â· When you make it past the interview stage weâll do a project together on contract, typically lasting between two to six weeks depending on how much time you can spend, to see how we work together (learn more about our <a href="https://automattic.com/global-hiring-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">global hiring guidelines</a>). When you join full-time, youâll do customer support for WordPress.com for your first twoÂ weeks and spend a week in support annually, for evermore, regardless of your position. We believe an early and ongoing connection with the people who use our products is irreplaceable.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting up</strong> Â· We get the whole company together once a year for seven days so that Automatticians can create bonds that influence them all year long. So far weâve done Grand Meetups in San Francisco, California; La Paz, Mexico; Oracle, Arizona; Breckenridge, Colorado; Mont-Sainte-Anne, QuÃ©bec; Seaside, Florida; Budapest, Hungary; San Diego, California; Santa Cruz, California;Â Park City, Utah; and Whistler, Canada.</p>
<p>In addition to our all-company Grand Meetup, teams meet for five to seven days to brainstorm team-level strategy and bond in locales ranging from Boulder to Buenos Aires, Las Vegas to Lisbon, MontrÃ©al to Mexico City, and Vienna to Vietnam. If you join our merry band, expect to travel three to four weeks perÂ year.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong> Â· In 2014 we started to work, as a company, on facilitating spaces for discussions about diversity at Automattic. And at the 2016 Grand Meetup with all of our employees across 50 countries, we decided to share with the rest of the world <a href="https://automattic.com/diversity-and-inclusion/">what we are doing about diversity and inclusion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What do we look for? </strong> Â· Automatticians are curious, driven, compassionate, tenacious, autonomous, friendly, independent, collaborative, communicative, supportive, self-motivated, and amazing with .gifs. We want to work with people interested in making the web and the world a better place. Think youâve got what it takes? Apply today.</p>
<p><strong>Getting to know us</strong> Â· Would you like to know a bit more about what itâs like to be part of Automattic? Check out this <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/this-ceo-runs-a-billion-dollar-company-with-no-offices-or-email-2016-3"><em>Business Insider</em> interview</a> with Matt on how our company runs without offices or email. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFhxUeNFfdJqXqfkh8AZAaWhHJROinzk">Meet a few colleagues (aka Automatticians)</a> and hear about their experiencesÂ in their own words. <a href="https://manofhustle.com/2016/02/24/qa-what-is-working-at-automattic-like/">Eric</a> did a Q&amp;A on what it&#8217;s like to work at Automattic. Still on the fence? <a href="https://karenalma.com/2016/02/07/my-fourth-anniversary-at-automattic/">Karen says</a> you should really just apply.</p>
<h4 class="ourprocess">Our Development Process</h4>
<p><strong>Data-informed, user-drivenÂ Â·</strong> For every feature we launch, we gather metrics about its usage, interaction, and growth in addition to listening to the masses of feedback we get on our blog and through support channels. This helps us inform decisions about new features and enhancements. Itâs not uncommon to launch a feature and then iterate immediately.</p>
<p class="extrabottom">We have a one-button deploy system for WordPress.com, and we push code to the site 60â80 times a day. WordPress.com is synced with the WordPress.org trunk pretty much every weekday. <strong>We&#8217;re strong believers in <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source</a></strong>, and we try to open source everything we can.</p>

I was born in England (where the rest of my non-immediate family lives) but moved to the states when I was 2 years old. We started in Minnesota, then moved to Florida, then the bay area of California in the span of 5 years. I grew up in a little town called Pleasanton, California (as pleasant as it sounds) before moving to Houston, Texas where I spent 18 years going to Middle School (Kleb), High School (Klien) and getting my associates degree at a Community college (Tomball Community College). <\/p>\n<p>After working as a bartender for a bit and finishing out my degree, I got my first real job opportunity at Hewlett Packard as a data analyst in a QA lab. Went on to become a team lead of their Software Quality Assurance team for their diagnostics software a few months later. I felt lost in such a big company and didn't fit in with the culture at all.<\/p>\n<p>After a year and a half there I got an offer from a friend to come work at a WordPress Hosting company called WP Engine here in Austin. So I packed up my bags and got engrossed in the startup \"cult\"ure and really fell in love with the people and places of Austin. Other than the heat, it's a perfect place for me.<\/p>\n<p>My WordPress experience at the time was creating a site for my webcomic I had been working on. My dream as a kid was to become a cartoonist, and after getting back into it about 5 years ago, I've been getting really good at my doodles.<\/p>\n<p>I spent the last 3 years (before starting at Automattic) at WP Engine doing tech support for a huge range of customers.  Towards the end of my time there, the startup culture had faded (at least on the support team) and I started getting burnt out on coming into work each day to a much less happy\/exciting environment after they implemented a quota system that drove out all of my favorite coworkers. Eventually I left the company as well. Through it all though, I never took out my frustrations on my customers EVER and was still very proud of the quality of support I was able to give. After leaving, I was able to step back and get some really good perspective on how my personal skills were tailored for customer support and why I should keep pursuing it and it's why I decided to become a Happiness Engineer<\/p>\n<p>In my spare time, I go to an artist meet up twice a week to hone my doodling skills. You can find my stuff on Tumblr or (better yet) Twitter:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/moegeemoe.com\/<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/richardjohnhunt<\/p>\n<p>I also do a YouTube Channel with my best bud MadHatter McGinnis (who works here with Automattic and recruited me) and two of my old coworkers at WP Engine. We do a Let's Play (We lay video games and podcast over them) show called ScrubBudz where we play classic games. I do all the art and half of the video editing for it. We've accomplished a lot over the past year and even had a booth at SXSW Gaming that was right next to Nintendo's booth... crazy to think about. Our stuff is not totally \"kid friendly\" since we swear and stuff but it's pretty approachable even if you don't play video games:<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCJS67fg7Daj8GUWvpFpOUTg<\/p>\n<p>Other than that, I live out here by Zilker park (about 5 mins from downtown Austin) with my two Gerbils: Milk and Cranberries.<\/p>\n<p>I'll add more to this in the future :)<\/p>\n","image":"https:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d8c7dfb08015f9911fd3428634a55bd9","latitude":30.267153,"longitude":-97.7430608},{"name":"Ivan Blazevic","role":"Happiness Engineer","bio":"","image":"https:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f266cc23b8b6cfc20cedbdd43541916c","latitude":42.708678,"longitude":19.37439},{"name":"Davi Pontes","role":"Happiness Engineer","bio":"<p>Family guy, happiness engineer, efficiency OCD, tech\/ gaming\/ music\/ sports enthusiast :)<br \/>\nBorn in Brazil, living in Canada, global citizen.<\/p>\n","image":"https:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/903678d1060a92c55529de9731982006","latitude":42.9869502,"longitude":-81.243177},{"name":"Sam Vaidya","role":"Happiness Engineer!  :)","bio":"","image":"https:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/79f42be513541a70bb10af8a56f5cf10","latitude":49.2827291,"longitude":-123.1207375},{"name":"Donal O\\'Conghaile","role":"Happiness Engineer","bio":"","image":"https:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f08389b504c8a063825d46e4e3fc02a2","latitude":-31.2532183,"longitude":146.921099},{"name":"Pankaj  Kumar","role":"Happiness Engineer","bio":"","image":"https:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7887eec372a22acb4bac49081a0811e3","latitude":23.2599333,"longitude":77.412615},{"name":"Thabo Tswana","role":"Engineering Happiness","bio":"<p>Thabo is a Zimbabwean Happiness Engineer at Automattic.

I grew up in a small town called Mazeikiai - the most notable fact about this town is the fact that a huge chunk of its population works at a nearby oil refinery.<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 15, I did my first attempts to do IT related work, like troubleshooting and fixing Windows issues, adding or replacing hardware etc. I was able to earn enough to go snowboarding once or twice a week during winter months. As it often happens at a young age, I didn't manage to keep up with growing competition and stay focused. Also I didn't quite enjoy the actual work.<\/p>\n<p>By the time I graduated from school, I had little idea what I want to do in life (besides snowboarding), so I went for Business Management and Administration degree in Klaipeda University.<\/p>\n<p>While studying, I tried a few jobs in completely different areas, but when the opening of a snowdome in Druskininkai, Lithuania, was announced in 2011 - I knew I had to be there.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after opening, in October 2011, I passed my exams and received an official certification of snowboarding instructor, which allowed me to work in our snowdome, as well as in Alps a few years later. Spending a lot of time strapped to a snowboard allowed me to become a local-level pro rider, and I did my fair share of competitions too.<\/p>\n<p>Few years later, I realized that being snowboarding instructor is a job for a few weeks or months a year only. I also realized there's more to life than just snowboarding, and I decided to pursue a career in IT.<\/p>\n<p>I didn't have any training in this area, and all my knowledge was self taught. I've spent a few months learning Java from Stanford online courses, as well as some Java for Android. <\/p>\n<p>After some time I started working at Western Union office in Vilnius as a Government Sanctions and Interdictions associate - even though this had little to do with IT. At the same time I was further deepening my IT knowledge - 3d modelling, indie game development, HTML and CSS. <\/p>\n<p>Later on, I worked as a Customer Success Manager at MailerLite - that allowed me to deepen my marketing knowledge, as well as get familiar with work in a successful IT company. <\/p>\n<p> SEO was also something I really enjoyed learning. I started experimenting with a WordPress membership site. Even though at some point I decided to give away my video tutorials for free - that experience helped me to get through a trial at Automattic, as a Happiness Engineer.<\/p>\n","image":"https:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7cf295febd74928fadbcf4502b3f2b08","latitude":54.6871555,"longitude":25.2796514},{"name":"Deric Lee","role":"Happiness Engineer","bio":"","image":"https:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a7e3f378735154ac8fc49653ea0a3777","latitude":3.139003,"longitude":101.686855},{"name":"Don Lair","role":"Customer Marketing Wrangler","bio":"<p>I'm a marketing veteran who has been poking around the internet since the mid-90's, back when I frequented an Orlando BBS called Infinite Space.

<ul>
<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
</section><section id="who-we-are-and-what-this-policy-covers"><h3 >Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h3>
<p>Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone &#8212; from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises &#8212; to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open Internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (âGPLâ). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, vip.wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, akismet.com, simplenote.com, simperium.com, leandomainsearch.com, cloudup.com, longreads.com, and happy.tools);</li>
<li>Our mobile applications (including the WordPress mobile app for Android and iOS);</li>
<li>Our other Automattic products and services that are available on or through our websites (including WordPress.com plans, WordPress.com VIP, Jetpack, the WooCommerce Services Extension, Gravatar, the IntenseDebate comment management system, Akismet plans, Simplenote, Simperium, Cloudup, Longreads, and Happy Tools); and</li>
<li>Other usersâ websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy weâll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as âServices.â And if youâd like to learn more about which Automattic company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on Controllers and Responsible Companies.</p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>
<p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
</section><section id="creative-commons-sharealike-license"><h3 >Creative Commons Sharealike License</h3>
<p>Weâve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">Github</a>. Youâre more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. Also, if you do use the policy weâd appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.</p>
</section><section id="information-we-collect"><h3 >Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do soâfor example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
<p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Letâs go over the information that we collect.</p>
</section><section id="information-you-provide-to-us"><h4 ><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></h4>
<p>Itâs probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address along with a username or name, <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/wpcc-faq/">depending on the service</a> â and thatâs it. You may provide us with more information â like your address and other information you want to share â but we donât require that information to create a WordPress.com account.</li>
<li><strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or an âAbout Meâ description. Your public profile information is just that &#8212; public &#8212; so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction and Billing Information:</strong> If you buy something from us âa subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, aÂ <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/domain-registrations-and-privacy/">custom domain</a>, or some fun Longreads swag, for example â you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</li>
<li><strong>Happy Tools Information:</strong> If you are a Happy Tools user, you will provide us with information to make use of the Serviceâs features. For example, you might enter timezone and location information, company information, and contact information.</li>
<li><strong>Ecommerce Site Information:</strong> If you use our ecommerce Services to sell products or services to others through your site (including <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/store/">Stores on WordPress.com</a>, the <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-services/">WooCommerce Services extension,</a> or other purchases on WooCommerce.com), you will have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some of our ecommerce Services, provide your site URL. You may also provide us with information about your financial account to set up a payments integration, such as the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information.</li>
<li><strong>Content Information:</strong> Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in draft and published content (such as for your website or your Crowdsignal survey). For example, if you write a blog post that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet if you choose to publish the post publicly. This might be obvious to youâ¦but itâs not to everyone!</li>
<li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). For example, Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems on their site more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Communications with Us (Hi There!):</strong> You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question about your site in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="information-we-collect-automatically"><h4 ><i>Information We Collect Automatically</i></h4>
<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Servicesâfor example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack servicesâin other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted â[title of post]â at [time/date]). As another example, our <a href="https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/">WooCommerce Usage Tracker</a> tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, PHP settings, and other features for your site, along with information about your online store, such as the aggregate number of orders and customers. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/admin-bar/">Admin Bar</a> and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>
<li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating systemâs permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Stored Information:</strong> We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating systemâs permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile deviceâs camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.</li>
<li><strong>Interactions with Other Usersâ Sites:</strong> We collect some information about your interactions with other usersâ sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your âLikesâ and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example, <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/algorithms-search-and-recommendations/">recommend posts</a> we think may interest you. As another example, for Intense Debate users, we collect information about the comments you make while logged in to your account, and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and provide the information about your comments in your Intense Debate public profile.</li>
<li><strong>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitorâs computer, and that the visitorâs browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our <a href="http://www.automattic.com/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="information-we-collect-from-other-sources"><h4 ><i>Information We Collect from Other Sources</i></h4>
<p>We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/publicize/">Publicize feature</a>, we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p>
<p>We may also get information, such as a mailing address, from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (â¦but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our services.</p>
</section><section id="how-and-why-we-use-information"><h3  style="margin-bottom:20px;">How and Why We Use Information</h3>
</section><section id="purposes-for-using-information"><h4 ><i>Purposes for Using Information</i></h4>
<p>We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide our Servicesâfor example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, charge you for any of our paid Services,Â or provide essays and stories for your reading pleasure through Longreads;</li>
<li>To further develop and improve our Servicesâfor example, by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;</li>
<li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>
<li>To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition &#8212; for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain length of time;</li>
<li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our Services;</li>
<li>To communicate with you, for example through an email, about offers and promotions offered by Automattic and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on Automattic and our products (which you can unsubscribe from at any time); and</li>
<li>To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations (for example, through our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/algorithms-search-and-recommendations/">Reader Post Suggestions</a>), target our marketing messages to groups of our users (for example, those who have a particular plan with us or have been our user for a certain length of time), and serve relevant advertisements.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="legal-bases-for-collecting-and-using-information"><h4 ><i>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</i></h4>
<p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:</p>
<p>(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account &#8212; for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or</p>
<p>(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or</p>
<p>(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or</p>
<p>(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information &#8212; for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or</p>
<p>(5) You have given us your consent &#8212; for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our <a href="http://www.automattic.com/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
</section><section id="sharing-information"><h3  style="margin-bottom:20px;">Sharing Information</h3>
</section><section id="how-we-share-information"><h4 ><i>How We Share Information</i></h4>
<p>We do not sell our usersâ private personal information.</p>
<p>We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic), those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites (such as the extensions on WooCommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g. our <a href="https://automattic.com/cookies/">Cookie Policy</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/">Legal Guidelines</a>. Additionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers&#8217; (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies. For example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers. Please see our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/domain-registrations-and-privacy/">Domain Registrations and Privacy support document</a> for more details.</li>
<li><strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/#emergency-requests-from-government-agencieslaw-enforcement">may disclose information related to the emergency without delay</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your site through our Publicize feature.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Site Owners: </strong>If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with a site, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site. For example, if you leave a comment on a site that uses our Services (like a site created on WordPress.com or a site running Jetpack), your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment.</li>
<li><strong>Published Support Requests:</strong> And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="information-shared-publicly"><h4 ><i>Information Shared Publicly</i></h4>
<p>Information that you choose to make public isâyou guessed itâdisclosed publicly.</p>
<p>That means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your âLikesâ and comments on other websites, are all available to othersâand we hope you get a lot of views!</p>
<p>For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you havenât uploaded one, is your <strong>G</strong>lobally <strong>R</strong>ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar &#8212; get it? :). Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, will display with the comments and âLikesâ that you make on other usersâ websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Your Gravatar + public profile information may also display with your comments, âLikes,â and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account with us is the same as the email address that you use on the other website.</p>
<p>We also provide a âFirehoseâ stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it, publicly.</p>
<p>Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>
<p>Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>
</section><section id="how-long-we-keep-information"><h3 >How Long We Keep Information</h3>
<p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it &#8212; which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information &#8212; and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>
<p>For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automatticâs websites, such as the visitorâs IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automatticâs websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>
<p>As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days just in case you change your mind and would like restore that content &#8212; because starting again from scratch is no fun, at all. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</p>
</section><section id="security"><h3 >Security</h3>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
<p>To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/security/two-step-authentication/">Two Step Authentication</a>.</p>
</section><section id="choices"><h3 >Choices</h3>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit the Information that You Provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services &#8212; for example, paid, premium themesâmay not be accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Access to Information on Your Mobile Device:</strong> Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you do so, you may not be able to use certain features (like adding a location to a photograph, for example).</li>
<li><strong>Opt-Out of Marketing Communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
<li><strong>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</strong> At this time, Automattic does not respond to âdo not trackâ signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automatticâs websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automatticâs websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
<li><strong>Close Your Account:</strong> While weâd be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our Services :( :( :( :(, you can close your account (for example, <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/close-account/">here</a>, for WordPress.com accounts).Â Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above &#8212; for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="your-rights"><h3 >Your Rights</h3>
<p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the âGDPRâ), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you arenât able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us.</p>
<p>EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>
</section><section id="controllers-and-responsible-companies"><h3 >Controllers and Responsible Companies</h3>
<p>Automatticâs Services are worldwide. Different Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.</p>
<p>Depending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the controller of your personal data. Generally, the âcontrollerâ is the Automattic company that entered into the contract with you under the Terms of Service for the the product or service you use.

</section><section id="ads-and-analytics-services-provided-by-others"><h4 ><i>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</i></h4>

<h4 class="howwework">HOW WE WORK</h4>
<p><strong>Choose your own adventure</strong> Â· Everyone works from the location they choose. Weâre spread out all over the world in more than 60 countries. We track about 70 percent of our projects on <a href="http://p2theme.com/">P2-themed</a> WordPress.com blogs, 25 percent in private chat rooms, and the rest on Slack. Because of the geographic variance, weâre active 24/7. We care about the work you produce, not just the hours you putÂ in.</p>
<p><strong>Coming on board</strong> Â· When you make it past the interview stage weâll do a project together on contract, typically lasting between two to six weeks depending on how much time you can spend, to see how we work together (learn more about our <a href="https://automattic.com/global-hiring-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">global hiring guidelines</a>). When you join full-time, youâll do customer support for WordPress.com for your first twoÂ weeks and spend a week in support annually, for evermore, regardless of your position. We believe an early and ongoing connection with the people who use our products is irreplaceable.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting up</strong> Â· We get the whole company together once a year for seven days so that Automatticians can create bonds that influence them all year long. So far weâve done Grand Meetups in San Francisco, California; La Paz, Mexico; Oracle, Arizona; Breckenridge, Colorado; Mont-Sainte-Anne, QuÃ©bec; Seaside, Florida; Budapest, Hungary; San Diego, California; Santa Cruz, California;Â Park City, Utah; and Whistler, Canada.</p>
<p>In addition to our all-company Grand Meetup, teams meet for five to seven days to brainstorm team-level strategy and bond in locales ranging from Boulder to Buenos Aires, Las Vegas to Lisbon, MontrÃ©al to Mexico City, and Vienna to Vietnam. If you join our merry band, expect to travel three to four weeks perÂ year.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong> Â· In 2014 we started to work, as a company, on facilitating spaces for discussions about diversity at Automattic. And at the 2016 Grand Meetup with all of our employees across 50 countries, we decided to share with the rest of the world <a href="https://automattic.com/diversity-and-inclusion/">what we are doing about diversity and inclusion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What do we look for? </strong> Â· Automatticians are curious, driven, compassionate, tenacious, autonomous, friendly, independent, collaborative, communicative, supportive, self-motivated, and amazing with .gifs. We want to work with people interested in making the web and the world a better place. Think youâve got what it takes? Apply today.</p>

<h4 class="ourprocess">Our Development Process</h4>
<p><strong>Data-informed, user-drivenÂ Â·</strong> For every feature we launch, we gather metrics about its usage, interaction, and growth in addition to listening to the masses of feedback we get on our blog and through support channels. This helps us inform decisions about new features and enhancements. Itâs not uncommon to launch a feature and then iterate immediately.</p>
<p class="extrabottom">We have a one-button deploy system for WordPress.com, and we push code to the site 60â80 times a day. WordPress.com is synced with the WordPress.org trunk pretty much every weekday. <strong>We&#8217;re strong believers in <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source</a></strong>, and we try to open source everything we can.</p>

<li><strong>Verify that the blog in question is hosted by Automattic. </strong>We have no control over blogs that say &#8220;Powered by WordPress.&#8221; Those blogs use the open source WordPress.org software and are not hosted by us.

<p>As required by the DMCA, we have aÂ policy to terminate users and/or sites that we consider to be repeat infringers. Although we wonât share the specifics of our repeat infringer policy (we don&#8217;t want anyone to game the system, after all), we believe that it strikes the right balance: it protects the rights of copyright owners and protects legitimate users from wrongful termination. Please note that notices that are successfully countered, rejected on fair use grounds, or deemed to be fraudulent are not counted against a user or site.</p>

				<p>Hi there! This Privacy Notice explains how we, at Automattic, process information about the visitors of our usersâ websites in connection with the services we provide through WordPress.com, Jetpack (including WooCommerce Services), IntenseDebate, Crowdsignal.com, and Akismet. Read on!</p>
</section><section id="whoe28099s-who-and-what-this-privacy-notice-covers"><h3 >Whoâs Who and What This Privacy Notice Covers</h3>
<p>Letâs talk first about who we are at Automattic, what we do, and what this Privacy Notice covers.</p>
<p>We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyoneâfrom bloggers, to small business owners, and enterprisesâto create, publish, and manage their own websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> offers the design, features, and support to bring a website to life.</li>
<li>With <a href="https://jetpack.com/">Jetpack</a>, website owners that host their websites elsewhere can connect those websites to features and tools available through WordPress.com and <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-services/">WooCommerce Services</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://crowdsignal.com/">Crowdsignal</a> helps site owners create quizzes, surveys, and polls that fit their brand and vision.</li>
<li><a href="https://intensedebate.com/">Intense Debate</a> gives site owners tools to manage comments on their websites.</li>
<li><a href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> helps keep spam under control by filtering out spam comments&#8211;hundreds of millions, every day!</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep things simple, in this Privacy Notice weâll refer to the users of the services we provide through these products and services&#8211;such as a websiteâs administrator, contributor, author, or editor&#8211;as our âUsers,â and weâll refer to our Usersâ websites as âSites.â Visitors to those Sites can read published content and interact with the Sites through features such as <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/comments/">comments</a>, â<a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/likes/">likes</a>,â poll/survey responses, and <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/following/">follows</a>.</p>
<p>We put together this Privacy Notice to help our Users understand the information we collect about their Site visitors (a/k/a our Usersâ users), and how that happens on their Sites. Our Users are responsible for publishing a privacy policy on their Sites that explains to their visitors how data is collected via the Sites and how that information is used and disclosed.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice does not apply to the information we collect about Users and those who visit Automatticâs websites (like automattic.com, wordpress.com, jetpack.com, or akismet.com)&#8211;thatâs covered in our <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Alright, with those introductions out of the way, letâs turn to how we collect, use, and share information about visitors to our Usersâ Sites.</p>
</section><section id="information-we-collect-about-visitors-to-our-userse28099-sites"><h3 >Information We Collect About Visitors to Our Usersâ Sites</h3>
<p>We collect information about visitors to our Usersâ Sites in a few different ways&#8211;we collect certain information that the visitors provide to the Site, we collect some information automatically, and we collect any information that our Users provide to us about their visitors.</p>
</section><section id="information-a-visitor-provides-to-a-site"><h4 ><em>Information a Visitor Provides to a Site</em></h4>
<p>Weâll start with information that visitors provide directly to a Site, which primarily happens when visitors type into a text field on a Site, like a comment field or a sign-up form. Our Users may also implement other ways to allow Site visitors to provide information directly through their Sites.</p>
<p>Here are the most common ways in which a visitor directly provides information to a Site:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follower and Subscriber Information:</strong> When a visitor signs up to follow or subscribe to a Site using Jetpack or WordPress.com, we collect the sign-up information requested by the Site, which typically includes an email address.</li>
<li><strong>Site Comments:</strong> When a visitor leaves a comment on a Site, we collect that comment, and other information that the visitor provides along with the comment, such as the visitorâs name and email address.</li>
<li><strong>Crowdsignal Survey Responses:</strong> When a visitor completes a poll, quiz, or other type of survey prepared by a User via Crowdsignal.com, we collect the visitorâs responses to those surveys, and other information that the survey owner requires for a poll/quiz/survey response, like an e-mail address.</li>
<li><strong>Order and Shipment Information:</strong> If a visitor orders something (hooray!) from a Site using our store and ecommerce features available through WordPress.com or Jetpack (including WooCommerce Services), we may collect information to process that order, such as credit card and billing information, and an address for shipping the package along to the recipient and calculating applicable taxes. We may also use this information for other purposes on behalf of our Users&#8211;for example, to send marketing and other communications from our Users to their customers, and to provide our User with analytics information about their ecommerce site (e.g., the number of orders from particular geographic areas).</li>
<li><strong>Other Information Entered on the Site:</strong> We may also collect other information that a visitor enters on the Site&#8211;such as a contact form submission, a search query, or Site registration.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="information-we-automatically-collect-from-the-site"><h4 ><em>Information We Automatically Collect from the Site</em></h4>
<p>We also automatically collect some information about visitors to a Site. The information we automatically collect depends on which of our services the Site uses. Weâve listed examples below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Data from a Visitor&#8217;s Computer and Etcetera:</strong> We collect the information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available about visitors to a Site, such as the IP address, browser type, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.</li>
<li><strong>Visitor Interactions:</strong> We collect information about a visitorâs interactions with a Site, including the â<a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/likes/">likes</a>â and â<a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/ratings/">ratings</a>â left by visitors to a Site using WordPress.com or Jetpack.</li>
<li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of a visitorâs device from the IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, tally for our Users how many people visit their Sites from certain geographic regions. If youâd like, you can read more about our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/stats/">Site Stats</a> feature for WordPress.com sites and Jetpack sites.</li>
<li><strong>Akismet Commenter Information:</strong> We collect information about visitors who comment on Sites that use our Akismet anti-spam service. The information we collect depends on how the User sets up Akismet for the Site, but typically includes the commenterâs IP address, user agent, referrer, and Site URL (along with other information directly provided by the commenter such as their name, username, email address&#8230;oh, and the comment itself, of course).</li>
<li><strong>Crowdsignal Response Information:</strong> We collect information about visitors who respond to a Crowdsignal survey. The information that we collect typically includes IP address, browser type, operating system, user agent, and the web page last visited.</li>
<li><strong>Intense Debate Commenter Information:</strong> We collect information about visitors who comment on Sites that use our Intense Debate service. The information that we collect depends on how the User sets up Intense Debate for the Site, but typically includes the IP address and account information on the Site, along with the comment.</li>
<li><strong>Jetpack Site Activity:</strong> We collect visitor activities related to the management of the Site, such as login attempts/actions and comment submission and management actions. For more information, please see the <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/privacy/">Jetpack Privacy Center</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Information from Cookies and Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a Site stores on a visitorâs computer, and that the visitorâs browser provides to the Site each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on Sites. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help identify and track visitors and Site usage, and to deliver targeted ads when ads are enabled for free WordPress.com sites or when ads are enabled on a Site through WordAds or Jetpack Ads (see the âOther Toolsâ section below for more details). For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how visitors can control the use of cookies, please see our <a href="https://automattic.com/cookies/">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also collect any other information that our Users provide to us about visitors to their Sites. For example, a User may upload a directory or other information about Site visitors and customers to the âbackendâ administrative platform for managing the Site.</p>
</section><section id="how-we-use-visitor-information"><h3 >How We Use Visitor Information</h3>
<p>We use information about Site visitors in order to provide our Services to our Users and their Sites. Our users may use our Services to, for example, create and manage their Site, sell products and services on their Site, flag and fight comments from spammers, and collect information through polls, quizzes and other surveys.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we use some information about Site visitors who are also our Users as described in our <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>We may also use and share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify any individual. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our services.</p>
</section><section id="how-we-share-visitor-information"><h3 >How We Share Visitor Information</h3>
<p>We may share information collected about Site visitors in the limited circumstances spelled out below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:</strong> We may disclose Site visitor information to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our services to our Users and their Sites, or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Notice for information about visitors that we share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Vendors:</strong> We may share Site visitor information with third party vendors who need to know this information in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our services to our Users and their Sites. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Requests:</strong> We may disclose Site visitor information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information, please see our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/">Legal Guidelines</a>.</li>
<li><strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> We may disclose Site visitor information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, our Users, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, Site visitor information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Notice would continue to apply to Site visitor information and the party receiving this information may continue to use this information, but only consistent with this Privacy Notice.</li>
<li><strong>Information Shared Publicly:</strong> Information that visitors choose to make public isâyou guessed itâdisclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like visitor comments and âlikesâ are all available to others, including information about the visitor that is displayed in connection with a comment or âlikeâ (such as a visitorâs WordPress.com username and Gravatar). We provide a âfirehoseâ stream of public data (including comments) from Sites to provide that data to firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content, but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="other-tools"><h3 >Other Tools</h3>
<p>Our Usersâ Sites may contain ads from third party ad networks and advertisers, and our Users may integrate other tools and services on their Sites (such as Google Analytics and third party plugins). Please note that this Privacy Notice only covers the collection of information by Automattic, and does not cover the collection by any third party.</p>
<p>Ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about visitorsâ use of a Site and across other websites and online services, such as a visitorâs IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by those companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to visitor interests. For more information about how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org, and for more information on interest-based ads, including information about how visitors may be able to opt out of having their web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">aboutads.info/choices</a> (US based) and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">youronlinechoices.eu</a> (EU based).</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information. This policy specifically explains how we, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them. </span></p>
</section><section id="what-are-cookies"><h3 >What are cookies?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to &#8220;remember&#8221; you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a &#8220;session cookie&#8221;) or for multiple repeat visits (using a &#8220;persistent cookie&#8221;). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as &#8220;first party cookies&#8221;), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (&#8220;third party cookies&#8221;). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as &#8220;web beacons&#8221; or &#8220;pixels.&#8221; These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted. </span></p>
</section><section id="how-we-use-cookies"><h3 ><b>How we use cookies</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users; and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;follow&#8221; button on a post, for example).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered WordPress.com user (so you donât have to log in every time, for example), while others are set whenever you visit one of our websites, irrespective of whether you have an account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we use, please see the Controlling Cookies section below. </span></p>
</section><section id="where-we-place-cookies"><h3 ><b>Where we place cookies</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We set cookies in a number of different locations across our services. These include:</span></p>

</ul>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight:400;">Advertising</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight:400;">These cookies are used to display relevant advertising to visitors who use our services or visit websites we host or provide, as well as to understand and report on the efficacy of ads served on our websites. They track details such as the number of unique visitors, the number of times particular ads have been displayed, and the number of clicks the ads have received. They are also used to build user profiles, including showing you ads based on products youâve viewed or acts you have taken on our (and other) websites. These are set by Automattic and trusted third party networks, and are generally persistent in nature.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight:400;">Third Party / Embedded Content</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight:400;">Sites hosted on WordPress.com make use of different third party applications and services to enhance the experience of website visitors. These include social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (through the use of sharing buttons), or embedded content from Youtube and Vimeo. As a result, cookies may be set by these third parties, and used by them to track your online activity. We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these cookies.</span></td>

</section><section id="user-sites"><h3 >User Sites</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In addition to the cookies set on our own sites, we utilize cookies for our </span><a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/stats/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Site Stats</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> feature. This tallies the unique numbers of visitors to a site, as well as the number from specific geographic locations. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">A visitor is counted when we see a user or browser for the first time in a given period.</span></p>
</section><section id="examples"><h3 >Examples</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Below are examples of the cookies set by Automattic, with explanations of their purpose. Some of these cookies are set across our whole network, whereas some are specific to individual services (e.g. WordPress.com, Longreads, etc). Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, but rather aims to be representative. Information about cookies that may be set by third parties, such as our ads partners, is below.Â Additionally, we occasionally set referrer cookies on Jetpack connected sites, using WooCommerce.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our mission is to democratize publishing. So that we can offer free access to create a website using WordPress.com, we show ads on some of our usersâ sites. Our users may also choose to place ads on their site through our ads program. Additionally, we also show ads from our ads program on some of our own websites (e.g. longreads.com), and in emails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We operate our ads program in partnership with third party vendors. As part of the operation of our ads program, we use cookies to collect certain information. Advertising cookies enable us and our partners to serve ads and to personalize those ads based on information like visits to our sites and other sites on the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Below is a representative list of our advertising program partners, along with information on the cookies that that each partner sets.Â </span><span style="font-weight:400;">The partners we work with change from time to time, and this is not an exhaustive list. Your choices to control cookies related to our ads program are described below.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On a mobile device, you may also be to adjust your settings to limit ad tracking. Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">You can opt out of Google Analytics by installingÂ </span><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"><span style="font-weight:400;">Googleâs opt-out browser add-on</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
</section><section id="our-internal-analytics-tool"><h3 >Our Internal Analytics Tool</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In order to better understand how our services are used, we monitor certain user activities that take place within our products, including page views and clicks on any links used when managing a site via our dashboards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We call each one of these actions an âevent.â Analytics events are attached to your WordPress.com account and are handled via a first party system that Automattic owns and maintains. In general, we record the following data for each event: IP address, WordPress.com user ID and username, WordPress.com-connected site ID (for sites not hosted on WordPress.com), user agent, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, and country code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We use this information to improve our products, make our marketing to you more relevant, personalize your experience, and for the other purposes described in our <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">You may opt out of our analytics program through your user settings. By doing so, you wonât share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Note that opting out does not disable the functionality of the actions we track &#8211; for example, if you publish a post, we will still have record of that (donât worry!), but for an event or action after you opt out, we will not have other data associated with that action or event in the analytics tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;"><em><strong>For our Simplenote Users:</strong></em> We use our first party analytics tool in Simplenote to help us better understand how Simplenote is used and improve the app for our users. You may opt-out through your privacy settings in the app. By doing so, you wonât share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out. One more thing&#8211;For Simplenote users who log onto Simplenote using their WordPress.com login, if youâd like to opt-out of our analytics tool on Simplenote, youâll also need to opt out on the Simplenote app&#8211;not on your </span><a href="https://wordpress.com/me/privacy"><span style="font-weight:400;">WP.COM Account Privacy Settings.</span></a></p>
</section><section id="consent-for-advertising-cookies-on-our-sites"><h3 >Consent for Advertising Cookies on Our Sites</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">You may see a âcookie bannerâ on our websites and dashboards. If you are visiting one of our users&#8217; sites from the EU, then we do not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you click to accept. When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set advertising cookies on the site you are visiting and on other of our websites, dashboards, and services. Weâll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.</span></p>
</section><section id="consent-and-choices-for-advertisements-on-our-userse28099-sites-through-our-ads-program"><h3 ><b>Consent and Choices for Advertisements on Our Usersâ Sites Through Our Ads Program</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">You may see a âcookie bannerâ on our usersâ websites, particularly if you are in the European Union. If so, then our ad program does not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you accept. When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set third party advertising cookies on our network in order to show you personalized ads. Weâll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">* Please note this consent feature was implemented on May 22, 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We set a cookie to help us understand how visitors engage with websites that participate in our ad program. Visitors may opt out of our use of this information by </span><a href="https://s.pubmine.com/opt-out"><span style="font-weight:400;">visiting this </span><span style="font-weight:400;">link</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (the opt-out will be processed immediately with no confirmation step). When you opt out, we replace the unique value for that cookie with an opt-out value</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. The opt-out works across all websites in our ads program. If you have opted out by accident, or wish to opt back in, you may do so by </span><a href="https://s.pubmine.com/opt-in"><span style="font-weight:400;">visiting this </span><span style="font-weight:400;">link</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.
