ordeal began with a knock on the door by federal agents who had Â a court order requiring the installation of surveillance equipment on Lavabit&#x27;s network .</p><p>âI had no choice but to consent to the installation of their device, which would hand the U.S. government access to all of the messagesâto and from all of my customersâas they travelled between their email accounts other providers on the internet,â Levison wrote in<em>Â The Guardian</em>.</p><p>âBut that wasn&#x27;t enough. The federal agents then claimed that their court order required me to surrender my company&#x27;s private encryption keys, and I balked. What they said they needed were customer passwords.â</p><h2>Long legal battle</h2><p>Levison told CBC he did not believe it was right to expose all his 410,000 users because the FBI wanted to investigate a handful of his customers.</p><p>âI thought if the government came knocking, I could give up the identity of the account holder and they could go directly to that person and collect the data, which is how I believe in a democracy the process should work. You should not be accused of a crime without ever finding out that you were accused,â he said.</p><p>Levison was held in contempt of a federal order and faced a court case in which neither he nor his attorneys were given access to background information and in which most of the information was under seal.</p><p>He shut down his company, rather than hand over the encryption code. Even today, he is not permitted to say who the FBI was investigating.</p><p>âI canât confirm or deny they were targeting Snowden.Â  The only thing Iâm not allowed to speak about to this day is who and how many targets they were going after in my system,â he said.</p><p>Last week, a federal judge unsealed key parts of the record detailing the governmentâs requests from Lavabit, freeing Levison to talk more openly about what happened.</p><p>âWith the decision last week, I feel empowered to speak out about the lack of justice that I received as a business and as an individual American,â Levison said.</p><p>Levison claimed he is worried his service could be used to hide criminal behaviour, but he believes the government should target its investigation against the individuals it is investigating, rather than all of his customers.</p><p>He intends to begin again in a new service with other developers in the coalition calledÂ the &quot;Dark Mail Alliance.&quot; Levison said he hopes to have a new encrypted email system in testing within a few months and widely available later this year.</p><h2>Privacy issues paramount</h2><p>Lavabit encryption was done on the server, using an SSO system to create a secure bridge to the client, but that wonât work if federal agents can demand the code for everyone at once.</p><p>âMoving the cryptography down to the client is a new technical challenge and one Iâm in the process of solving,â he said.</p><p>Levison believes Snowdenâs revelations have made people more conscious of the need for privacy and there will be a growing market for really secure email systems.</p><p>âI simply feel that the freedom to communicate privately, the freedom to associate without suspicion or being accused of criminal behaviour in secret reports is so important to a free and functioning democracy that Iâm willing to invest new technology Â to ensure that future generations donât succumb to biting from the forbidden apple like this one,â he said.</p><p></p><p></p></span></div></div><div class="contentFeedback"><div class="bottomSeparator"><a href="http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/reporting-to-canadians/acts-and-policies/programming/journalism/" class="journalistLink">CBC&#x27;s Journalistic Standards and Practices</a><span class="separator">|</span><a href="/news/about-cbc-news-1.1294364" class="trustProjectLink">About CBC News</a></div><a href="javascript:location.href=&quot;//www.cbc.ca/news2/feedback/index_typo.html?Lavabit founder fought 9-month legal battle with FBI &quot; + new Date().toString();" class="reportIssue">Report Typo or Error</a><span class="separator">|</span><a href="//cbchelp.cbc.ca/hc/en-us/requests/new" class="feedback">Send Feedback</a></div><div class="relatedlinks sclt-relatedlinks"><h2 class="sectionTitle"><span class="sectionTitleText">Related Stories</span></h2><ul class="relatedList"><div class="relatedStory"><li class="relatedListItem"><a class="relatedLink" href="/news/world/nsa-leaker-edward-snowden-s-surveillance-warning-1.2476458"><div class="label flag"><span class="labelText">Video</span></div> <!-- -->NSA leaker Edward Snowden&#x27;s surveillance warning</a></li><li class="relatedListItem"><a href="https://storify.com/cbccommunity/encryped-email-lavabit-shut-down-snowden" class="relatedLink"> <!-- -->Snowden&#x27;s encrypted email service Lavabit shuts down</a></li><li class="relatedListItem"><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2013/10/11/ladar-levison-edward-snowdens-e-mail-provider/" class="relatedLink"> <!-- -->THE CURRENT: Ladar Levison, Edward Snowden&#x27;s e-mail provider</a></li></div></ul></div><div class="lazy-load"></div><div class="comments cbc-vf" id="comments-12658374"><div name="comments-12658374"><h2 class="sectionTitle"><span class="sectionTitleText"><span><span class="vf-counter vf-widget" data-widget="counter" data-path="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/lavabit-founder-fought-9-month-legal-battle-with-fbi-1.2658374"></span><span> Comments</span></span></span></h2><p class="commentIntro">To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada&#x27;s online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

You can tell a lot more about people, their habits, their relationships, their friendships, even their political preferences, based on that type of metadata.&quot;</p><p>The document does not say exactly how the Canadian spy service managed to get its hands on two weeks&#x27; of travellers&#x27; wireless data from the airport Wi-Fi system, although there are indications it was provided voluntarily by a &quot;special source.&quot;</p><p>The country&#x27;s two largest airports â Toronto and Vancouver âÂ both say they have never supplied CSEC or other Canadian intelligence agency with information on passengers&#x27; Wi-Fi use.</p><p>Alana Lawrence, a spokesperson for the Vancouver Airport Authority, says it operates the free Wi-Fi there, but does &quot;not in any way store any personal data associated with it,&quot; and has never received a request from any Canadian intelligence agency for it.</p><p>A U.S.-based company, Boingo, is the largest independent supplier of Wi-Fi services at other Canadian airports, including Pearson International in Toronto.</p><p>Spokesperson Katie O&#x27;Neill tells CBC News: &quot;To the best of our knowledge, [Boingo] has not provided any information about any of our users to the Canadian government, law enforcement or intelligence agencies.&quot;</p><p>It is also unclear from the document how CSEC managed to penetrate so many wireless systems to see who was using them âÂ specifically, to know every time someone targeted at the airport showed up on one of those other Wi-Fi networks elsewhere.</p><p>Deibert and other experts say the federal intelligence agency must have gained direct access to at least some of the country&#x27;s main telephone and internet pipelines, allowing the mass-surveillance of Canadian emails and phone calls.</p><h2>&#x27;Blown away&#x27;</h2><p></p><p>Ontario&#x27;s privacy commissioner Ann Cavoukian says she is &quot;blown away&quot; by the revelations.</p><p></p><p>&quot;It is really unbelievable that CSEC would engage in that kind of surveillance of Canadians.
