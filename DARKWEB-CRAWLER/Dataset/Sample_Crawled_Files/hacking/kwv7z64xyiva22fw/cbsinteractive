<h5>Managing Third Parties&#39; Behaviorally Targeted Advertising on Your Computer</h5>.

<p>A number of the companies that use cookies to collect information about your online activities using web-based advertising are members of theÂ <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a>(&quot;NAI&quot;). The NAI offers a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads from member companies. To opt out of information collection by NAI member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank">NAI consumer opt out page</a>. Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance (&quot;DAA&quot;), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To learn more and make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please visit the<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Â DAA consumer opt out page</a>, <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/choices/" target="_blank">Canadian DAA online choice page</a>, <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">European DAA online choice page</a>Â and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com.au/opt-out" target="_blank">Australian DAA online choice page</a>.

<p>Also, we work with DigiTrust to set a first-party cookie in your browser to enable us and <a href="http://www.digitru.st/participating-companies/" target="_blank">DigiTrust Partners</a> to collect web viewing data that includes visits to the Services and non-affiliated websites over time. This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences. DigiTrust is a non-profit, industry-wide collaboration of companies supporting a standardized user token in order to improve the consumer online experience. To learn more about how DigiTrust collects and uses information for online advertising, please visit <a href="http://www.digitru.st/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">http://www.digitru.st/privacy-policy/</a>. You can opt-out of the collection of data in this way for interest-based advertising by visiting the DigiTrust opt-out page <a href="http://www.digitru.st/about-this-notice/" target="_blank">here</a> or the Digital Advertising Allianceâs <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/" target="_blank">choice page</a> and opting out from DigiTrust. Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent a first-party cookie from being set in this way.</p>

<p>If you opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on our Services, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.</p>

<h5>Adjusting Your Browser Settings</h5>.

<p>You have the option to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, and delete cookies periodically (including third party behaviorally targeted advertising cookies). Each browser is different, so please refer to the guide below, which describes how to set the cookie options on a number of different browser types. If your browser is not listed below, please visitÂ <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">All About Cookies</a>Â where you may find more information about your specific browser, or select the &quot;Help&quot; menu in your browser.</p>

<p>Web beacons are generally used in conjunction with cookies, so if your browser is set to reject cookies, or if you delete cookies, web beacons will not be able to track your activity as you navigate between web-sites.<br>It is up to you whether to allow us or third parties to send you cookies, but if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some or all of a CBS Service or other websites.</p>

        <h4>All Access Subscriptions and Billing<a name="Fee_Based_Services"></a></h4>

        <p>This Section 8 contains additional provisions that apply if you subscribe to All Access.</p>

        <p><strong>8.1Â Â  Â <span class="underline">All Access Account Information</span>.Â </strong> You can access and edit specific details regarding your subscription to All Access, including information concerning your credit card or other available payment method (â<strong>Payment Method</strong>â), on the CBS.com website at any time by clicking on your name, which appears at the top of each page of the site when you are logged in, and then following the link to your All Access account.</p>

        <p><strong>8.2Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Age Limitations</span>.</strong>Â  Individuals under the age of 18 may utilize All Access only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian.Â  You acknowledge that by using All Access, you may be exposed to Content that you find objectionable, and it is your sole responsibility to determine whether the Content in All Access is suitable for you.Â  Some Content may not be suitable for people under the age of 18.</p>

        <p><strong>8.3Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Supported Devices</span>.</strong>Â  To see if All Access is available for your device click <a href="https://cbsi.secure.force.com/CBSi/ViewArticle_allaccess?popup=true&aId=kA00L000000UAR2&categories=CBS_Entertainment%3AGetting_Started&template=template_cbsvod&referer=cbs.com/vod&data=&cfs=SFS_FT" target="_new"> here.</a></p>

        <p><strong>8.4Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Payment</span>.</strong>Â  By providing Payment Method information for your All Access subscription, you are agreeing to pay a monthly or annual subscription fee, as applicable, and any applicable taxes and service fees (âFeesâ) in connection with your use of All Access.  The Fees will be charged to your Payment Method automatically at the beginning of your subscription (or, as described in Section 8.9, at the end of your Trial Period, where applicable), and at the beginning of each subscription period renewal thereafter on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your subscription unless you cancel your subscription or your account or All Access is suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms.  If your monthly subscription begins after the 28th day of a month, then in any subsequent month in which that day does not occur, CBS Interactive will charge your Payment Method on approximately the last day of such month.  For example, if you started your monthly subscription on January 31st, your next payment date will be approximately February 28th.  The Fees charged to your Payment Method may vary from month to month or year-to-year due to changes in your subscription plan or applicable taxes, and you authorize CBS Interactive to charge your Payment Method for these amounts.  CBS Interactive reserves the right to change the pricing of All Access at any time.  In the event of a price change, CBS Interactive will post the new pricing in All Access and attempt to notify you in advance by sending an email to the address you have registered for your account.  If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your All Access subscription as described in Section 8.6.  If there are any discrepancies in billing, you hereby waive your right to dispute such discrepancies if you do not notify CBS Interactive within 60 days after they first appear on an account statement.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL INTERNET ACCESS CHARGES.  PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER FOR INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INTERNET DATA USAGE CHARGES.</p>

        <p><strong>8.5Â Â  Â <span class="underline">No Refunds</span>.</strong>Â  ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.  As described further in Section 8.6, even if you cancel All Access during a monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable, you will not receive a refund for any portion of the Fees for the remainder of that monthly or annual subscription period.  In rare circumstances, we may provide a credit, refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our subscribers (âCreditsâ).  The amount and form of such Credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole discretion.  The provision of Credits in one instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide Credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>

        <p><strong>8.6Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Cancellation</span>.</strong>Â  You can cancel your subscription to CBS All Access at any time by contacting us at (888)274-5343, Monday to Sunday 8 am to midnight EST, or by logging into your account at https://www.cbs.com/all-access/account/ and clicking "cancel subscription."  If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of the then-current monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable.  You will have continued access to All Access for the remainder of your paid subscription period, but YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FEES PAID.  You must cancel your subscription before it renews for the next month or year, as applicable, to avoid paying the Fees for the next month or year, as applicable.  After cancellation of your subscription, you will continue to owe any accrued amounts due under these Terms and not yet paid.  You acknowledge and agree that cancellation of your subscription is your sole recourse if you have any dissatisfaction, issue or concern related to All Access, its Content or features or these Terms, including Fees, applicable taxes, or billing methods; the selection of Content available to you through All Access; these Terms, including the CBS Interactive <a href="http://legalterms.cbsinteractive.com/privacy">Privacy Policy </a>, or any changes thereto; or any other All Access policies or practices.</p>

        <p><strong>8.7Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Unpaid Amounts</span>.</strong>Â  If you fail to pay any Fees when due, as a result of expiration of your Payment Method, insufficient funds, or otherwise, (1) you will remain liable for all such amounts, as well as any costs that CBS Interactive incurs in collecting any amounts you fail to pay in connection with All Access, including attorney and collections fees; (2) you authorize CBS Interactive to continue charging your Payment Method, as your Payment Method information may be updated as described in Section 8.1; and (3) we may suspend or terminate your subscription.  Changing your Payment Method information may affect the day of your subscription renewal.</p>

        <p><strong>8.8Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Promo Codes</span>.Â </strong> From time to time, promotional codes may be available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion.Â  Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion.Â  Promotional codes can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may not be combined with other offers, subject to certain restrictions as determined by CBS Interactive in its sole discretion.Â  If you received a promotional code through an offer by a third party, additional conditions may apply.</p>

        <p><strong>8.9.Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Trial Period</span>.Â </strong> CBS Interactive may provide a limited free trial period (â<strong>Trial Period</strong>â) to new users and certain former subscribers at its sole discretion, but is under no obligation to do so, and Trial Periods may not be available at all times.Â  CBS Interactive reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial Period.Â  The specific terms of the Trial Period will be stated in the marketing material describing the particular Trial Period.Â  If CBS Interactive provides you with a Trial Period, you must provide valid Payment Method information to CBS Interactive in order to use All Access during the Trial Period.Â  CBS Interactive will not charge you in connection with the Trial Period.Â  CBS Interactive may place a temporary charge in a nominal amount on your Payment Method to ensure the validity of the Payment Method, but the temporary charge will be removed promptly.  If you do not cancel All Access by the last â<strong>day</strong>â of your Trial Period, you authorize CBS Interactive to begin your paying subscription and automatically charge your Payment Method for your first paying monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable, at the end of your Trial Period.Â  CBS INTERACTIVE WILL NOT SEND YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TRIAL PERIOD HAS ENDED OR THAT YOUR PAYING SUBSCRIPTION HAS BEGUN.Â  IF YOU WISH TO AVOID CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, YOU MUST CANCEL THE TRIAL PERIOD PRIOR TO THE LAST âDAYâ OF YOUR TRIAL PERIOD.Â  A â<strong>day</strong>â for purposes of these Terms begins at the time you start your subscription (i.e., complete the sign up process), and ends 24 hours later.Â  For example, if you complete your registration at 3:00 p.m. on a Monday in your time zone, and your Trial Period is 2 days, you have until 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday in your time zone to cancel your subscription before your paying subscription will begin.Â  You may only have one Trial Period before you must begin paying for All Access.Â  If you exceed this limit, CBS Interactive may charge your Payment Method for any Trial Period after the first, or suspend your use of All Access, in its sole discretion.</p>

        <p><strong>8.10Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Maximum Streams</span>.Â </strong> You may only use a maximum of two simultaneous streams (measured across all Content available on All Access) at any time regardless of the number of devices that CBS Interactive permits you to use with All Access.Â  CBS Interactive may change the maximum number of simultaneous streams of All Access that you may use at any time in its sole discretion.</p>

        <p><strong>8.11Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Broadcast and Territory Restrictions</span>.</strong>Â  All Access is only available to US-based users.Â  You may only use All Access and its Content in the United States and for your own personal, non-commercial purposes.Â  Certain features and Content may only be available to users in certain locations, during certain periods, and on certain devices, and the availability of certain features and Content may change over time. Please check the <a href="http://cbsi.force.com/CBSi/allaccess" target="_blank">All Access FAQ</a> for more information about current limitations.Â  In the case of geographic limitations, your location may not be identified accurately by the technology used for All Access, so you may be unable to access certain features and Content even if you are located in an area in which we intend to provide access.Â  You consent to CBS Interactive and its third party providers determining your location for purposes of providing All Access.Â  CBS Interactive will not be liable to you for any blackouts, location-based limitations, device-based limitations, Content-viewing windows, changes in CBS affiliate stations, availability of Content, or other restrictions or limitations in connection with All Access or the Content.</p>

        <p><strong>8.12Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Quality of Service</span>.</strong>Â  The quality of the display of the streaming Content may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, including your location and the speed of your Internet connection.Â  The time it takes to begin watching Content will also vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time and the configuration of your device.Â  CBS Interactive makes no representations or warranties about the quality of your watching experience on your device.</p>

        <p><strong>8.13Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Updates and Testing</span>.</strong>Â  CBS Interactive reserves the right to update and change All Access, including its features and the selection of Content available in All Access, at any time.Â  In addition, CBS Interactive reserves the right to test various aspects of All Access.Â  CBS Interactive reserve the right to, and by using our Services you agree that we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice.</p>

        <p><strong>8.14Â Â  Â <span class="underline">All Access-specific Emails</span>.</strong>Â  As part of All Access, CBS Interactive may send you emails regarding the Content or All Access from time to time.Â  You agree that CBS Interactive may send you these types of emails to the email address that you provide.Â  Because these emails are necessary for you to receive All Access, you agree that you will receive these emails even if you have opted out of receiving other email from CBS Interactive.Â  If you do not want to receive these types of emails, you may cancel All Access at any time as provided in Section 8.6.</p>

        <p><strong>8.15.  <span class="underline">Subscriptions Obtained Through Third Parties</span>.</strong>  If you obtain an All Access subscription through a third party distributor that maintains your subscriber account and collects your payments for All Access, that subscription is subject to the distributorâs terms, and the provisions of this Section 8 concerning subscriptions, billing and payment do not apply to that subscription.  When you access All Access through a portal provided by such a third-party distributor, and the distributor transmits All Access Content to you, the provisions of this Section 8 concerning access to and delivery of All Access do not necessarily apply, and in the event of a conflict, the distributorâs applicable terms govern.</p>

        <p><strong>8.16.  <span class="underline">Temporary Download and Offline Viewing</span>.</strong>  Some CBS All Access content is available for temporary download and offline viewing on certain supported devices ("Offline Titles") with certain subscription plans. Limitations apply, including restrictions on the number of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number of devices that can contain Offline Titles, the time period within which you will need to begin viewing Offline Titles and how long the Offline Titles will remain accessible. Offline Titles are not be playable outside the United States. </p>

        <h4>Other Fee-Based Services<a name="Other_Fee_Based"></a></h4>

        <p>If you accept fee-based Services other than All Access, you agree to the additional terms governing all such purchases as provided to you or posted on the Services to which they apply, including all requirements to pay applicable fees and taxes.Â  Except as otherwise provided in such additional terms, the provisions of this Section 9 apply to such fee-based Services.</p>

        <p>Unless otherwise stated, all fees and charges are non-refundable, including for unused portions of cancelled subscriptions.Â  We do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.</p>

        <p>CBS Interactive reserves the right to change the pricing of all Services at any time.Â  In the event of a price change, CBS Interactive will post the new pricing on the relevant Service and attempt to notify you by sending an email to the address you have registered.Â  Billing for all mobile subscription services will be governed by the <a href="#Mobile_Features">Mobile_Features</a> section of these Terms (Section 10) unless the terms of the subscription say otherwise.</p>

        <p>We may offer trial subscriptions to paid Services for free or at special discounted prices.Â  Unless otherwise stated, these trial subscriptions will automatically become paying subscriptions at the current subscription rate if you do not cancel before the end of the trial period.</p>

        <p><strong>Your wireless provider may charge for use of Mobile Features, including fees for receipt of text messages or data transmission.Â  In order to receive Mobile Features, your wireless provider may require you to subscribe to additional services, which may require additional fees.Â  These fees are not charged by us, and you should contact your wireless provider before you sign up for Mobile Features to determine what fees, if any, will be charged.Â  In addition, you agree that we may arrange for Mobile Features billing through your wireless provider and that your wireless provider may invoice you for the applicable fees or deduct them from your pre-paid balance.</strong></p>

        <p>You may not transfer or copy any Content from the wireless device on which you originally received Content to any other device, including, without limitation, any computer or another wireless device.</p>

        <p>To cancel a Mobile Feature that involves a subscription fee, you must follow the instructions included in the terms and conditions applicable to that Mobile Feature; otherwise, you will continue to incur subscription charges. If you stop a subscription-based Mobile Feature in the middle of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund for that billing cycle.</p>

Contact information for the American Arbitration Association, as well as copies of the Rules and applicable forms, are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a> In circumstances in which the Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will take place in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in San Francisco, California.  For any non-frivolous Claim that does not exceed $50,000, CBS Interactive will pay all costs of the arbitration, and reimburse any filing fees you may be required to pay.  If the arbitrator awards you damages that are greater than CBS Interactiveâs last written settlement offer communicated before commencement of the arbitration, CBS Interactive will pay you the greater of $1,000 or the amount of the award.</p>

<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES THAT ARISE OUT OF CBSiâS ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, ARE NOT IRREPARABLE AND ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF RESTRICTING EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, PROGRAM, TELEVISION SHOW, MOTION PICTURE, OR OTHER AUDIO/VISUAL CONTENT OWNED, CONTROLLED, OR DISTRIBUTED BY CBSi, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE APPLICATION.</p>

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h5>8. Indemnity</h5>

<p>You will indemnify, defend, and hold CBSi and all of its officers, directors, owners, employees, agents, information providers, service providers, vendors, contractors, affiliates, partners, and licensors (collectively, the &#8220;<strong>CBSi Parties</strong>&#8221;) harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneysâ fees) incurred by any of the CBSi Parties in connection with any claim, including, but not limited to, claims for defamation, violation of rights of publicity or privacy, copyright infringement, or trademark infringement arising out of: your use of the Application; any use or alleged use of your account or your passwords by any person, whether or not authorized by you; your connection to CBSiâs or its vendorsâ servers; your violation of this Agreement; or your violation of the rights of any other person or entity.Â  CBSi reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify CBSi, and you will cooperate with CBSiâs defense of these claims.</p>

<h5>9. Termination.</h5>

<p>This Agreement is effective until terminated.Â  You may terminate this Agreement at any time by: (i) irretrievably erasing, deleting, or destroying all copies of the Application in your possession or control; and (ii) ceasing to use the Services and Content available through the Application.Â  CBSi may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason.Â  However, if you paid CBSi or its authorized Distribution Channel to acquire the Application, and we terminate this Agreement within one year after you made your payment for reasons other than your breach of this Agreement or the CBSi Terms, we will refund a prorated portion of the purchase price corresponding to the portion of such one year period for which our action caused you not to be able to use the Application.Â  Upon termination for any reason, the license granted in Section 4 will immediately terminate.Â  The provisions in Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 will survive any termination.</p>

<h5>10. Export Controls.</h5>

<p>You will not ship, transfer, or export the Application into any country or use the Application in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions, or regulations (collectively, &#8220;<strong>Export Laws</strong>&#8221;).Â  You represent and warrant that you are not a citizen of, and are not located within, a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &#8220;terrorist supporting&#8221; country, and that you are not otherwise prohibited under the Export Laws from receiving the Application.</p>

<h5>11. Governing Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction.</h5>

<p>This Agreement and all claims arising from or related to your use of the Application will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, except Californiaâs conflict of law rules.Â  This Agreement and the Application will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, if applicable.</p>

<p>With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration (as set forth below), you agree to exclusive jurisdiction in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California.Â  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, we may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, you must file any claim or action related to use of the Application or this Agreement within one year after such claim or action accrued. Otherwise, you will waive the claim or action.</p>

<h5>12. Disputes; Arbitration</h5>

<p>If you have any dispute with or claim against us or any of our affiliates (a &#8220;<strong>Claim</strong>&#8221;) arising out of or relating to the Application or this Agreement, and the claim is not resolved by calling our customer service department at (877) 814-7002, you and we each agree to resolve such disputes through an individual binding arbitration or an individual action in small claims court.Â  Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and your Claim may not be consolidated with any other personâs claim.Â  You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.Â  This Section 12 shall survive termination of this Agreement or any subscription that you may have to receive Content.</p>

<p>Before you commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action with respect to your Claim, you must first send to CBS Interactive a written notice of your claim (&#8220;<strong>Notice</strong>&#8221;).Â  The Notice must (1) be sent by certified mail; (2) be addressed to: CBS Interactive, 235 Second Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 Attn: Legal Department; (3) describe the nature of your Claim; and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek.Â  If we and you do not then resolve the Claim within 30 days after our receipt of your Notice is received, either you or we may commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action to resolve the Claim.</p>

<p>Any such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association and be conducted in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, including the Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures, if applicable (the &#8220;<strong>Rules</strong>&#8221;).Â  Contact information for the American Arbitration Association, as well as copies of the Rules and applicable forms, are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>.Â  In circumstances in which the Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will, at your request, take place in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in San Francisco, California.Â  For any non-frivolous Claim that does not exceed $50,000, CBS Interactive will pay all costs of the arbitration, and reimburse any filing fees you may be required to pay.Â  If the arbitrator awards you damages that are greater than CBS Interactiveâs last written settlement offer communicated before commencement of the arbitration, CBS Interactive will pay you the greater of $1,000 or the amount of the award.</p>

<h5>13. Miscellaneous.</h5>

<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements, provided, however, that this Agreement will coexist with the CBSi Terms and any Additional Terms.Â  To the extent that the provisions of this Agreement conflict with the CBSi Terms, this Agreement will govern.Â  We may be required by state or federal law to notify you of certain events.Â  You hereby acknowledge and agree that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you via email, if you have provided it to us.Â  If you do not provide us with accurate information or we do not have access to your email address, we will not be responsible for failure to notify you.Â  If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be removed, and the remainder of the Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable, except as expressly stated.Â  Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Â  Except as otherwise required by law, the controlling language of this Agreement is English.Â  This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.Â  You and we acknowledge and agree that the Distribution Channel and its subsidiaries are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you.</p>

        <h4>All Access Subscriptions and Billing<a name="Fee_Based_Services"></a></h4>

        <p>This Section 8 contains additional provisions that apply if you subscribe to All Access.</p>

        <p><strong>8.1Â Â  Â <span class="underline">All Access Account Information</span>.Â </strong> You can access and edit specific details regarding your subscription to All Access, including information concerning your credit card or other available payment method (â<strong>Payment Method</strong>â), on the CBS.com website at any time by clicking on your name, which appears at the top of each page of the site when you are logged in, and then following the link to your All Access account.</p>

        <p><strong>8.2Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Age Limitations</span>.</strong>Â  Individuals under the age of 18 may utilize All Access only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian.Â  You acknowledge that by using All Access, you may be exposed to Content that you find objectionable, and it is your sole responsibility to determine whether the Content in All Access is suitable for you.Â  Some Content may not be suitable for people under the age of 18.</p>

        <p><strong>8.3Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Supported Devices</span>.</strong>Â  To see if All Access is available for your device click <a href="https://cbsi.secure.force.com/CBSi/ViewArticle_allaccess?popup=true&aId=kA00L000000UAR2&categories=CBS_Entertainment%3AGetting_Started&template=template_cbsvod&referer=cbs.com/vod&data=&cfs=SFS_FT" target="_new"> here.</a></p>

        <p><strong>8.4Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Payment</span>.</strong>Â  By providing Payment Method information for your All Access subscription, you are agreeing to pay a monthly or annual subscription fee, as applicable, and any applicable taxes and service fees (âFeesâ) in connection with your use of All Access.  The Fees will be charged to your Payment Method automatically at the beginning of your subscription (or, as described in Section 8.9, at the end of your Trial Period, where applicable), and at the beginning of each subscription period renewal thereafter on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your subscription unless you cancel your subscription or your account or All Access is suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms.  If your monthly subscription begins after the 28th day of a month, then in any subsequent month in which that day does not occur, CBS Interactive will charge your Payment Method on approximately the last day of such month.  For example, if you started your monthly subscription on January 31st, your next payment date will be approximately February 28th.  The Fees charged to your Payment Method may vary from month to month or year-to-year due to changes in your subscription plan or applicable taxes, and you authorize CBS Interactive to charge your Payment Method for these amounts.  CBS Interactive reserves the right to change the pricing of All Access at any time.  In the event of a price change, CBS Interactive will post the new pricing in All Access and attempt to notify you in advance by sending an email to the address you have registered for your account.  If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your All Access subscription as described in Section 8.6.  If there are any discrepancies in billing, you hereby waive your right to dispute such discrepancies if you do not notify CBS Interactive within 60 days after they first appear on an account statement.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL INTERNET ACCESS CHARGES.  PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER FOR INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INTERNET DATA USAGE CHARGES.</p>

        <p><strong>8.5Â Â  Â <span class="underline">No Refunds</span>.</strong>Â  ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.  As described further in Section 8.6, even if you cancel All Access during a monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable, you will not receive a refund for any portion of the Fees for the remainder of that monthly or annual subscription period.  In rare circumstances, we may provide a credit, refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our subscribers (âCreditsâ).  The amount and form of such Credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole discretion.  The provision of Credits in one instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide Credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>

        <p><strong>8.6Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Cancellation</span>.</strong>Â  You can cancel your subscription to CBS All Access at any time by contacting us at (888)274-5343, Monday to Sunday 8 am to midnight EST, or by logging into your account at https://www.cbs.com/all-access/account/ and clicking "cancel subscription."  If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of the then-current monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable.  You will have continued access to All Access for the remainder of your paid subscription period, but YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FEES PAID.  You must cancel your subscription before it renews for the next month or year, as applicable, to avoid paying the Fees for the next month or year, as applicable.  After cancellation of your subscription, you will continue to owe any accrued amounts due under these Terms and not yet paid.  You acknowledge and agree that cancellation of your subscription is your sole recourse if you have any dissatisfaction, issue or concern related to All Access, its Content or features or these Terms, including Fees, applicable taxes, or billing methods; the selection of Content available to you through All Access; these Terms, including the CBS Interactive <a href="http://legalterms.cbsinteractive.com/privacy">Privacy Policy </a>, or any changes thereto; or any other All Access policies or practices.</p>

        <p><strong>8.7Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Unpaid Amounts</span>.</strong>Â  If you fail to pay any Fees when due, as a result of expiration of your Payment Method, insufficient funds, or otherwise, (1) you will remain liable for all such amounts, as well as any costs that CBS Interactive incurs in collecting any amounts you fail to pay in connection with All Access, including attorney and collections fees; (2) you authorize CBS Interactive to continue charging your Payment Method, as your Payment Method information may be updated as described in Section 8.1; and (3) we may suspend or terminate your subscription.  Changing your Payment Method information may affect the day of your subscription renewal.</p>

        <p><strong>8.8Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Promo Codes</span>.Â </strong> From time to time, promotional codes may be available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion.Â  Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion.Â  Promotional codes can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may not be combined with other offers, subject to certain restrictions as determined by CBS Interactive in its sole discretion.Â  If you received a promotional code through an offer by a third party, additional conditions may apply.</p>

        <p><strong>8.9.Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Trial Period</span>.Â </strong> CBS Interactive may provide a limited free trial period (â<strong>Trial Period</strong>â) to new users and certain former subscribers at its sole discretion, but is under no obligation to do so, and Trial Periods may not be available at all times.Â  CBS Interactive reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial Period.Â  The specific terms of the Trial Period will be stated in the marketing material describing the particular Trial Period.Â  If CBS Interactive provides you with a Trial Period, you must provide valid Payment Method information to CBS Interactive in order to use All Access during the Trial Period.Â  CBS Interactive will not charge you in connection with the Trial Period.Â  CBS Interactive may place a temporary charge in a nominal amount on your Payment Method to ensure the validity of the Payment Method, but the temporary charge will be removed promptly.  If you do not cancel All Access by the last â<strong>day</strong>â of your Trial Period, you authorize CBS Interactive to begin your paying subscription and automatically charge your Payment Method for your first paying monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable, at the end of your Trial Period.Â  CBS INTERACTIVE WILL NOT SEND YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TRIAL PERIOD HAS ENDED OR THAT YOUR PAYING SUBSCRIPTION HAS BEGUN.Â  IF YOU WISH TO AVOID CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, YOU MUST CANCEL THE TRIAL PERIOD PRIOR TO THE LAST âDAYâ OF YOUR TRIAL PERIOD.Â  A â<strong>day</strong>â for purposes of these Terms begins at the time you start your subscription (i.e., complete the sign up process), and ends 24 hours later.Â  For example, if you complete your registration at 3:00 p.m. on a Monday in your time zone, and your Trial Period is 2 days, you have until 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday in your time zone to cancel your subscription before your paying subscription will begin.Â  You may only have one Trial Period before you must begin paying for All Access.Â  If you exceed this limit, CBS Interactive may charge your Payment Method for any Trial Period after the first, or suspend your use of All Access, in its sole discretion.</p>

        <p><strong>8.10Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Maximum Streams</span>.Â </strong> You may only use a maximum of two simultaneous streams (measured across all Content available on All Access) at any time regardless of the number of devices that CBS Interactive permits you to use with All Access.Â  CBS Interactive may change the maximum number of simultaneous streams of All Access that you may use at any time in its sole discretion.</p>

        <p><strong>8.11Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Broadcast and Territory Restrictions</span>.</strong>Â  All Access is only available to US-based users.Â  You may only use All Access and its Content in the United States and for your own personal, non-commercial purposes.Â  Certain features and Content may only be available to users in certain locations, during certain periods, and on certain devices, and the availability of certain features and Content may change over time. Please check the <a href="http://cbsi.force.com/CBSi/allaccess" target="_blank">All Access FAQ</a> for more information about current limitations.Â  In the case of geographic limitations, your location may not be identified accurately by the technology used for All Access, so you may be unable to access certain features and Content even if you are located in an area in which we intend to provide access.Â  You consent to CBS Interactive and its third party providers determining your location for purposes of providing All Access.Â  CBS Interactive will not be liable to you for any blackouts, location-based limitations, device-based limitations, Content-viewing windows, changes in CBS affiliate stations, availability of Content, or other restrictions or limitations in connection with All Access or the Content.</p>

        <p><strong>8.12Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Quality of Service</span>.</strong>Â  The quality of the display of the streaming Content may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, including your location and the speed of your Internet connection.Â  The time it takes to begin watching Content will also vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time and the configuration of your device.Â  CBS Interactive makes no representations or warranties about the quality of your watching experience on your device.</p>

        <p><strong>8.13Â Â  Â <span class="underline">Updates and Testing</span>.</strong>Â  CBS Interactive reserves the right to update and change All Access, including its features and the selection of Content available in All Access, at any time.Â  In addition, CBS Interactive reserves the right to test various aspects of All Access.Â  CBS Interactive reserve the right to, and by using our Services you agree that we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice.</p>

        <p><strong>8.14Â Â  Â <span class="underline">All Access-specific Emails</span>.</strong>Â  As part of All Access, CBS Interactive may send you emails regarding the Content or All Access from time to time.Â  You agree that CBS Interactive may send you these types of emails to the email address that you provide.Â  Because these emails are necessary for you to receive All Access, you agree that you will receive these emails even if you have opted out of receiving other email from CBS Interactive.Â  If you do not want to receive these types of emails, you may cancel All Access at any time as provided in Section 8.6.</p>

        <p><strong>8.15.  <span class="underline">Subscriptions Obtained Through Third Parties</span>.</strong>  If you obtain an All Access subscription through a third party distributor that maintains your subscriber account and collects your payments for All Access, that subscription is subject to the distributorâs terms, and the provisions of this Section 8 concerning subscriptions, billing and payment do not apply to that subscription.  When you access All Access through a portal provided by such a third-party distributor, and the distributor transmits All Access Content to you, the provisions of this Section 8 concerning access to and delivery of All Access do not necessarily apply, and in the event of a conflict, the distributorâs applicable terms govern.</p>

        <p><strong>8.16.  <span class="underline">Temporary Download and Offline Viewing</span>.</strong>  Some CBS All Access content is available for temporary download and offline viewing on certain supported devices ("Offline Titles") with certain subscription plans. Limitations apply, including restrictions on the number of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number of devices that can contain Offline Titles, the time period within which you will need to begin viewing Offline Titles and how long the Offline Titles will remain accessible. Offline Titles are not be playable outside the United States. </p>

        <h4>Other Fee-Based Services<a name="Other_Fee_Based"></a></h4>

        <p>If you accept fee-based Services other than All Access, you agree to the additional terms governing all such purchases as provided to you or posted on the Services to which they apply, including all requirements to pay applicable fees and taxes.Â  Except as otherwise provided in such additional terms, the provisions of this Section 9 apply to such fee-based Services.</p>

        <p>Unless otherwise stated, all fees and charges are non-refundable, including for unused portions of cancelled subscriptions.Â  We do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.</p>

        <p>CBS Interactive reserves the right to change the pricing of all Services at any time.Â  In the event of a price change, CBS Interactive will post the new pricing on the relevant Service and attempt to notify you by sending an email to the address you have registered.Â  Billing for all mobile subscription services will be governed by the <a href="#Mobile_Features">Mobile_Features</a> section of these Terms (Section 10) unless the terms of the subscription say otherwise.</p>

        <p>We may offer trial subscriptions to paid Services for free or at special discounted prices.Â  Unless otherwise stated, these trial subscriptions will automatically become paying subscriptions at the current subscription rate if you do not cancel before the end of the trial period.</p>

        <p>In addition to the general terms applicable to the Services, the following terms apply to Services designed for wireless devices (â<strong>Mobile Features</strong>â), which we offer only to users who are 18 years of age or older and located in the fifty U.S. states or the District of Columbia unless otherwise noted.</p>

        <p><strong>Your wireless provider may charge for use of Mobile Features, including fees for receipt of text messages or data transmission.Â  In order to receive Mobile Features, your wireless provider may require you to subscribe to additional services, which may require additional fees.Â  These fees are not charged by us, and you should contact your wireless provider before you sign up for Mobile Features to determine what fees, if any, will be charged.Â  In addition, you agree that we may arrange for Mobile Features billing through your wireless provider and that your wireless provider may invoice you for the applicable fees or deduct them from your pre-paid balance.</strong></p>

        <p>You may not transfer or copy any Content from the wireless device on which you originally received Content to any other device, including, without limitation, any computer or another wireless device.</p>

        <p>To cancel a Mobile Feature that involves a subscription fee, you must follow the instructions included in the terms and conditions applicable to that Mobile Feature; otherwise, you will continue to incur subscription charges. If you stop a subscription-based Mobile Feature in the middle of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund for that billing cycle.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

        </ul>

        <p>We will not be liable to you or any third party for taking any of these actions and we will not be limited to the remedies above if you violate these Terms.Â  If CBS Interactive terminates your access to any of the Services, you must immediately stop using such Service.Â  However, if you have paid for a subscription to All Access or another paid Service, and we discontinue the Service before the end of a paid subscription period, or we terminate your account before the end of a paid subscription period for reasons other than your breach of these Terms, we will refund a prorated portion of the applicable subscription fee corresponding to the portion of the paid subscription period for which our action caused you not to have access to the relevant Service.Â  If CBS Interactive terminates your access to All Access or another paid Service because you breached these Terms, you will not be entitled to any refund.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Unsolicited Submissions. Â <a name="Unsolicited_Submissions"></a></h4>

        <p><strong>CBS Interactive does not accept unsolicited submissions, including scripts, story lines, articles, fan fiction, characters, drawings, suggestions, ideas or concepts.Â  It is CBS Interactiveâs policy to delete any such submission without reading it.Â  Any similarity between an unsolicited submission and any elements in any CBS creative work would be purely coincidental.</strong></p>

        <p>You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless CBS Interactive, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, vendors, partners, contractors, agents, licensors or other representatives and all of their successors and assigns (collectively, the â<strong>CBS Interactive Parties</strong>â) with respect to all third party claims, costs (including attorneyâs fees and costs), damages, liabilities, and expenses or obligations of any kind, arising out of or in connection with your use or misuse of the Services (including, without limitation use of your account, whether or not authorized by you, and claims arising from User Submissions).Â  CBS Interactive retains the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any claim subject to indemnification, and in such cases you agree to cooperate with us to defend such claim.Â  You may not settle any claim covered by this Section 14 without CBS Interactiveâs prior written approval.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability<a name="Disclaimers"></a></h4>

        <p>THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT: (1) THAT THE SERVICES, ANY OF THE SERVICESâ FUNCTIONS OR ANY CONTENT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR FREE OF ERRORS OR OMISSIONS; (2) THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; (3) THAT THE SERVICES OR THE SERVERS HOSTING THEM ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE; OR (4) THAT THE SERVICES OR INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE.Â  THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIES SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY SUCH ISSUES.Â  THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIES DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND AS TO QUALITY, AVAILABILITY AND SUBJECT MATTER OF CONTENT.Â  THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT AND FUNCTIONS MADE AVAILABLE ON OR ACCESSED THROUGH OR SENT FROM THE SERVICES, ARE PROVIDED âAS IS,â âAS AVAILABLE,â AND âWITH ALL FAULTS.â</p>

        <p>YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THEIR FUNCTIONS AND CONTENT) IS AT YOUR RISK. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES.</p>

        <p>THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OR DELAY IN THEIR PERFORMANCE DUE TO ANY CAUSE BEYOND THEIR REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING ACTS OF WAR, ACTS OF GOD, ACTS OF THIRD PARTIES, EARTHQUAKE, FLOOD, EMBARGO, RIOT, SABOTAGE, LABOR SHORTAGE OR DISPUTE, GOVERNMENTAL ACT, POWER FAILURE OR FAILURE OF THE INTERNET OR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT.</p>

        <p>THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THEIR FUNCTIONS AND CONTENT), YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THEIR FUNCTIONS AND CONTENT), THESE TERMS OR YOUR USER SUBMISSIONS, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE OR EVEN IF ONE OR MORE OF THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, BUT EXCLUDING WILLFUL MISCONDUCT).Â  IN NO EVENT WILL THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIESâ LIABILITY FOR OTHER DAMAGES EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO CBS INTERACTIVE FOR ACCESS TO THE RELEVANT SERVICE IN THE THREE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

        <p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES THAT ARISE OUT OF THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIESâ ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, ARE NOT IRREPARABLE AND ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF RESTRICTING OPERATION OF THE SERVICES OR ANY OTHER SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, PROGRAM, TELEVISION SHOW, MOTION PICTURE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIES.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Governing Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction<a name="Jurisdiction"></a></h4>

        <p>These Terms and all claims as between you and us arising from or related to your use of the Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, except California&#39;s conflict of law rules.Â  These Terms will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, if applicable.</p>

        <p>With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration (as set forth below), you agree to jurisdiction in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California.Â  Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, we may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, you must file any claim or action related to use of the Services or these Terms within one year after such claim or action accrued.Â  Otherwise, you will waive the claim or action.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Disputes; Arbitration<a name="Arbitration"></a></h4>

        <p>If you have any dispute with or claim against us or any of our affiliates, or if we have a dispute with or claim against you, in either case arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms (a â<strong>Claim</strong>â), and the Claim is not resolved by calling our customer service department at (888)274-5343, you and we each agree to resolve such Claim through an individual binding arbitration or through an individual action in small claims court in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence or in San Francisco, California.  Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and your Claim may not be consolidated with any other personâs claim.  You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This Section 17 shall survive termination of these Terms or any subscription that you may have to any of the Services.</p>

        <p>Before you or we commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action with respect to a Claim, you must first send to CBS Interactive a written notice of your claim or we must send a written notice of our claim to you ("<strong>Notice</strong>").  Your Notice must (1) be sent by certified mail; (2) be addressed to: CBS Interactive, 235 Second Street, San Francisco, CA 94105Attn: Legal Department; (3) describe the nature of your Claim; and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek.  If we and you do not then resolve the Claim within 30 days after our receipt of Notice is received, either you or we may commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action to resolve the Claim.</p>

        <p>Any such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association and be conducted in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the â<strong>Rules</strong>â).  Contact information for the American Arbitration Association, as well as copies of the Rules and applicable forms, are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a> In circumstances in which the Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will take place in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in San Francisco, California.  For any non-frivolous Claim that does not exceed $50,000, CBS Interactive will pay all costs of the arbitration, and reimburse any filing fees you may be required to pay.  If the arbitrator awards you damages that are greater than CBS Interactiveâs last written settlement offer communicated before commencement of the arbitration, CBS Interactive will pay you the greater of $1,000 or the amount of the award.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Miscellaneous<a name="Miscellaneous"></a></h4>

        <p>We may be required by state or federal law to notify you of certain events.Â  You hereby acknowledge and agree that such notices will be effective upon our posting them in the relevant Service or delivering them to you via email.Â  You may update your email address by visiting the Services where you have provided contact information.Â  If you do not provide us with accurate information, we will not be responsible for failure to notify you.Â  Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Â  These Terms, including all additional terms, conditions, and policies on the Services, constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all prior agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof.Â  Nothing in these Terms affects any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you.Â  If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be removed, and the remainder of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>

        <p>You authorize us to provide information concerning you and your activities to comply with applicable laws or respond to court order, subpoenas, or other lawful requests, or if we believe doing so would protect your safety or that of another person or protect the security of the Services, or as otherwise described in the <a href="http://legalterms.cbsinteractive.com/privacy">Privacy Policy </a>.

        <p><strong>If you do not agree to these Terms, you should immediately stop using the Services.Â </strong> If you want to delete your account on a Service, please use contact instructions posted on the Service at which you obtained the account.Â  If you are an All Access subscriber, you must first cancel your subscription before you will be able to delete your account.Â  Any User Submissions you made while using the Services will continue to be governed by Section 6 of these Terms.</p>

        <p>Sections 6 and 11-18 of these Terms will survive any termination of your access to the Services, whether we terminate your access or you voluntarily discontinue your use.</p>

    <p>Some of the advertisements you see on theÂ CBS ServicesÂ are delivered by third parties who also collect information through their ownÂ <a href="/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/cookies-and-beacons">cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies</a> about your online activities, either on our ServicesÂ or across the Internet, in an effort to understand your interests and deliverÂ advertisements that are tailored to your interests. These third parties include advertisers, advertising agencies, and adÂ networks that may collect information about you when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites.</p>

<p>CBS does not have access to the information these third parties may collect about your interests to deliver relevant advertising to you, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.Â These companies may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes. Some of these companies are members of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> (&quot;NAI&quot;), which offers a single location to opt out of receiving tailored advertisementsÂ from member companies. To opt out of information collection by NAI member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">NAI consumer opt out page</a>. Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance (&quot;DAA&quot;), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. CBS is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more and make choices about interest-based advertisements from participating third parties, please visit the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">DAA consumer opt out page</a>, <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/choices/" target="_blank">Canadian DAA online choice page</a>, <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">European DAA online choice page</a> and <a href="http://youronlinechoices.com.au/opt-out" target="_blank">Australian DAA online choice page</a>. Also, on most mobile devices, you can install the DAA&#39;s AppChoices app to make choices about cross-app interest-based advertisements from participating third parties.</p>

<p>Also, we work with DigiTrust to set a first-party cookie in your browser to enable us and <a href="http://www.digitru.st/participating-companies/" target="_blank">DigiTrust Partners</a> to collect web viewing data that includes visits to the Services and non-affiliated websites over time. This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences. DigiTrust is a non-profit, industry-wide collaboration of companies supporting a standardized user token in order to improve the consumer online experience. To learn more about how DigiTrust collects and uses information for online advertising, please visit <a href="http://www.digitru.st/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">http://www.digitru.st/privacy-policy/</a>. You can opt-out of the collection of data in this way for interest-based advertising by visiting the DigiTrust opt-out page <a href="http://www.digitru.st/about-this-notice/" target="_blank">here</a> or the Digital Advertising Allianceâs <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/" target="_blank">choice page</a> and opting out from DigiTrust. Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent a first-party cookie from being set in this way.</p>

<p>In addition, CBS works with third parties to help us track the advertisements that are delivered to you, in particular to control the number of times you receive the same advertisements, and to analyze the effectiveness of advertising on the CBS Services.Â Third parties that use <a href="/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/third-party-online-advertising">cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies</a> to help us with traffic measurement, research and analytics include <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy" target="_new">A</a><a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html"">dobe</a>, <a href="http://www.comscore.com/About_comScore/Privacy_Policy" target="_blank">Comscore</a>, <a href="http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs&amp;nav=1#Optoutchoices" target="_blank">Nielsen</a> and <a href="http://www.confirmit.com/privacy-policy.aspx" target="_blank">ConfirmIT</a>. We do not share contact information with these third parties.Â If you opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on our Services, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.</p>

<p>On certain mobile devices, third parties may collect mobile device identification numbers (e.g. Appleâs Identifier for Advertising IP (IDFA) or Googleâs Android Advertising ID (AAID)) and may use this information in connection with other data about you (or that you have provided to parties other than us), including data regarding your use of websites, apps or other services over time to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests across these devices. You may be able to opt out of such tailored advertisements through settings made available by mobile operating systems. For example, Google Android settings may allow you to opt out of interest based advertising or Apple iOS settings may allow you to limit ad tracking.</p>
