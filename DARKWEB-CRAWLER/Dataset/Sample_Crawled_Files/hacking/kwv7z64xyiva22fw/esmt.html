<p>Â </p>

<p>December 10-11, 2018<br />ESMT Berlin<br />Schlossplatz 1, 10178 Berlin<br /><br />The Digital Society Conference 2018 - Empowering ecosystems will cover new developments in security and privacy, digital politics, and industrial strategies. A particular focus will be the reality of the rise of AI - its societal implications, how to understand and harness the battle for AI dominance. And we will take a closer look at platforms - their role, their power, how to build them and how and when to control them. We have outstanding speakers and contributors from strategy, tech and politics and want you to join us in our quest.<br />The conference will bring two days of technical and political panels, presentations, and workshops, giving you many different perspectives from science, industry and governments and including speakers from MIT, NATO, Oxford University, Tel Aviv University, the AI Initiative of The Future Society, the German Bundestag, and many more.</p></div><div  class="tool light-mobile wide odd"><fieldset class="collapsible collapsed form-wrapper"><div class="legend"><span class="fieldset-legend">Program</span></div><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><h2>Program</h2><h3><strong>Day 1, </strong><strong>December 10, 2018</strong></h3>

A visiting professor at many leading schools, including Stanford Universityâs School of Engineering, UC Berkeley Haas and NYU Stern, Dr. Baumard pioneered works on information and cyber warfare in the early 1990s, noticeably with his âFrom Info-War to Knowledge-Warfareâ (AFCEA, 1996) and earlier works anticipating many pitfalls on network economies. Dr. Baumard was appointed in 2010, and renewed in 2013 and 2017, as President of the Scientific Council for Defense and Security policy and strategic issues (CSFRS), a French State public and private dual-agency under the authority of Franceâs Prime Minister. The main focus of his research is autonomous and implicit learning systems, tacit learning and their implications for resilience and cyber-deterrence. An associate expert with UC Berkeley Center for catastrophic risk management (CCRM) since 2005, Dr. Baumard studied knowledge and organizational learning dynamics in adversarial and degraded environments, such as security crises, natural disasters or economic warfare. In all these instances, Baumardâs research investigates how organizations can continue their operations, and prevail, with truncated data, subverted or antagonistic learning, compromised or deteriorated defenses. His applied research focuses on behavioral learning for the deterrence of advanced threats on critical infrastructures, which is mainly led into Akheros, a cyber-defense corporation based in Paris. Dr. Baumard published 11 books, including Tacit Knowledge in Organizations (Sage), The Strategic Void (CNRS, 2012) and Cybersecurity in France (Springer, 2017). </p></div></div></fieldset><div class="collapse-text-text"><p><img height="100" width="100" alt="Prof. Philippe Baumard, Professor and Research Associate, Ecole Polytechnique" title="Prof. Philippe Baumard, Professor and Research Associate, Ecole Polytechnique" class="media-element file-preview" src="https://m.esmt.org/sites/default/files/styles/media_thumbnail/public/philippe-baumard_100x100.png" /></p></div><fieldset class="collapse-text-fieldset collapsible collapsed form-wrapper"><div class="legend"><span class="fieldset-legend">&gt;&gt;Dr. Georg T.
