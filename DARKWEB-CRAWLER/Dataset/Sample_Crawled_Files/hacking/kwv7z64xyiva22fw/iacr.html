<b>On  the  Security  of  the  PKCS#1  v1.5  Signature  Scheme</b><p />
<i>Tibor  Jager   and  Saqib  A.  Kakvi   and  Alexander  May</i><p />
<b>Abstract: </b>The  RSA  PKCS#1  v1.5  signature  algorithm  is  the  most  widely  used  digital  signature  scheme  in  practice.  Its  two  main  strengths  are  its  extreme  simplicity,  which  makes  it  very  easy  to  implement,   and  that  verification  of  signatures  is  significantly  faster  than  for  DSA  or  ECDSA.  Despite  the  huge  practical  importance  of  RSA  PKCS#1  v1.5  signatures,  providing  formal  evidence  for  their  security  based  on  plausible  cryptographic  hardness  assumptions  has  turned  out  to  be  very  difficult.  Therefore  the  most  recent  version  of  PKCS#1 (RFC 8017)  even  recommends  a  replacement  the  more  complex   and  less  efficient  scheme  RSA-PSS,  as  it  is  provably  secure   and  therefore  considered  more  robust.  The  main  obstacle  is  that  RSA  PKCS#1  v1.5  signatures  use  a  deterministic  padding  scheme,  which  makes  standard  proof  techniques  not  applicable. 
<P>
We  introduce  a  new  technique  that  enables  the  first  security  proof  for  RSA-PKCS#1  v1.5  signatures.  We  prove  full  existential  unforgeability  against  adaptive  chosen-message  attacks (EUF-CMA)  under  the  standard  RSA  assumption.  Furthermore,  we  give  a  tight  proof  under  the  Phi-Hiding  assumption.  These  proofs  are  in  the  random  oracle  model   and  the  parameters  deviate  slightly  from  the  standard  use,  because  we  require  a  larger  output  length  of  the  hash  function.  However,  we  also  show  how  RSA-PKCS#1  v1.5  signatures  can  be  instantiated  in  practice  such  that  our  security  proofs  apply.
<P>
In  order  to  draw  a  more  complete  picture  of  the  precise  security  of  RSA  PKCS#1  v1.5  signatures,  we  also  give  security  proofs  in  the  standard  model,  but  with  respect  to  weaker  attacker  models (key-only  attacks)   and  based  on  known  complexity  assumptions.  The  main  conclusion  of  our  work  is  that  from  a  provable  security  perspective  RSA  PKCS#1  v1.5  can  be  safely  used,  if  the  output  length  of  the  hash  function  is  chosen  appropriately.
