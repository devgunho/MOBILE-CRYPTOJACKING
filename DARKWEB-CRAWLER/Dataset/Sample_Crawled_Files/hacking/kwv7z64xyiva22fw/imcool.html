          <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">
            Neu Romance is a project I started as a part of my artist residency at Pioneer Works. I wanted to blend special effects makeup and technology together to visualize what modern cybernetic augmentation could look like.</p>
          <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">Through the project, I did a lot of research on the history of cyborgs and cyberpunk, primarily from the viewpoint of socialist feminism, and the project turned into a way for me to help underepresented people with an interest in transhumanism explore their most idealized view of themselves. This project is ongoing, and if you'd like to participate please reach out.

          <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">
            Tiny Gallery is a project that allows you to display pixel art on a Raspberry Pi, the pixel art is controlled from a hosted web site, and when you click on the art piece you want to display, it shows up for 2 seconds. It's a fun and cute interactive project, and you can totally make one yourself! It also utilizes Microsoft Technology such as the IoT Hub, Azure File Storage, and Azure Web Apps.

            Rick's Big Day is an unreleased video game I made while teaching myself how to use the popular JavaScript and HTML framework for browser based games.</p>
          <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">You play as Rick, my fun and food loving cat, as he makes his way around my apartment trying to find things to play with.

          <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">I wrote all the code and made all the pixel art, music was done by Luke Silas from Anamanaguchi.

          <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">
            The cute image bot is inspired by Japanese Puri booths!</p>
          <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">
It's a twitter bot that takes selfies you tweet at it and puts cute overlays on top. It's using technology from Microsoft's Cognitive Services, primarily the Face API to use facial recognition on selfies people tweet at it. From there it uses midpoint math, and image Magick to overlay hand drawn eyes, noses, and cheeks onto the selfie before sending it back.

          <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">
          Cute Bot was born out of being bummed out for a bit, I wanted to make something to make myself and other people feel better.</p>
          <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">
            I've always been interested in twitter bots, but I'd never worked with twitter streams or bots before. Luckily <a class="washed-red" href="http://twitter.com/tinysubversions">Darius Kazemi</a> has a lot of great resources available online which made the project really easy.</p>

        <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">
        I've been talking about building this thing forever. With the gentle prodding of a few friends who just kept on telling me to just do it, I took the plunge.</p>

        <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">The only problem was, I've never worked with hardware before. I've never built a node app from scratch. I've never used socket.io. I've never soldered. And the list goes on.</p>

        <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">BUT I DID IT. And even though many mistakes were made, I still learned a ton and figured out the bugs in the end. There's something seriously satisfying about building something technical and getting to hold it in your hands.</p>

        <p class="f5 f5-l lh-copy fugue">This whole project is open source, because I want people to build their own and continue to contribute to the library to be able to add on cool modules and other fun things.
