      window.presentations = {"dkom30hidingandhookingwithwindowsextensionhosts":{"presentationTitle":"DKOM 3.0: Hiding and Hooking with Windows Extension Hosts","synopsis":"Windows 7 introduces the concept of Extension Hosts through an internal, exported API that is now used by over 15 components in Windows 10. These components have the ability to expose, and access, internal functionality of the operating system, as well as provide new capabilities to the OS, obviating the usual import/export table mechanism that is known and loved by all. This presents a new interesting hooking attack surface, as well as persistence capabilities, and leverages data structures and mechanisms that are not yet protected by PatchGuard. This talk will show case today's built-in extension hosts, the APIs for custom registrations and abuse of the interface, and how defenders can monitor and watch for potential attacks using this interface. We will be releasing some WinDBG scripts/tools to analyze extension hosts to beef up defender's memory forensics toolkits, and showcase some interesting post-exploitation capabilities for red teams.","speakers":["alexionescu","gabrielleviala","yardenshafir"]},"combinarceforandroidschrome":{"presentationTitle":"Combina: RCE for Android's Chrome","synopsis":"Browsers were always attractive targets for hackers because of many reasons, such as their popularity and their huge remote attack surface. Thus, Chrome developers invest a lot of efforts in attack mitigations for making those vulnerabilities unexploitable (or, at least, hardly exploitable). In this talk, I will reveal a novel 0-day vulnerability in Chrome I found that provides remote-code-execution (RCE). I will also explain how I bypassed all of the attack mitigation to gain a working exploit.","speakers":["almogbenin"]},"teeexploitationbyexampleexploitingtrustedappsinsamsungstee":{"presentationTitle":"TEE Exploitation by Example: Exploiting Trusted Apps in Samsung's TEE","synopsis":"Samsung uses a TrustZone-based Trusted Execution Environment(TEE) in their handsets for a variety of sensitive tasks including payments (Samsung Pay), key storage  (Android KeyStore) and system integrity verification (TIMA).\n\nOn their exynos chipsets, the TEE functionality is implemented using the Kinibi OS from Trustonic combined with Samsung's own Trusted Applications (TA) and Trusted Drivers (TD). Both TAs and TDs run as userspace components on  Kinibi, with TDs having the capability of owning the complete system.\n\nWe reported 4 different vulnerabilities in these components to Samsung, each of a different class. In this talk we provide an in-depth description of the exploits we developed for these issues.\n\nWe first provide a small introduction to what TEEs are and how TrustZone is used to support a TEE. We follow up with introducing the Kinibi OS and explaining how to start reversing and bug hunting on Kinibi TAs and TDs.\n\nNext, we focus on three types of vulnerabilities through the following examples: SVE-2018-12852 - a classic stack-based buffer overflow, for which we describe how to create a ROP chain that allows performing arbitrary calls to further explore the system, SVE-2018-12855 - a double-fetch issue inherent to the shared memory interface used by most TEEs and SVE-2018-12853 - an invalid free issue, for which we introduce the internals of the heap allocator used by Kinibi and analyze possible avenues for exploitation of heap corruption vulnerabilities.\n\nFinally, we look into post-exploitation opportunities after compromising a Trusted Application. For this we present the API between TAs and TDs and zoom into how we exploited SVE-2018-12881 to compromise the Linux kernel and the RKP hypervisor.","speakers":["eloisanfelix"]},"aftermemorycorruptionthenextsecurityextinctionevent":{"presentationTitle":"After Memory Corruption: The Next Security Extinction Event","synopsis":"Day 1: Keynote","speakers":["windowsnyder"]},"adventuresinvideoconferencing":{"presentationTitle":"Adventures in Video Conferencing","synopsis":"Over the past five years, video conferencing support on websites and applications has exploded. Facebook, WhatsApp, FaceTime and Signal are just a few of the many ways that users can make audio and video calls across networks. This talk discusses the security of the most popular video conferencing solutions, including WebRTC, FaceTime and WhatsApp. It will describe the architecture of these solutions, how to instrument them for fuzzing as well as examples of vulnerabilities found so far.","speakers":["nataliesilvanovich"]},"abusinginsecurewcfendpointsforfunandprofit":{"presentationTitle":"Abusing Insecure WCF Endpoints for Fun and Profit","synopsis":"Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a framework for building service-oriented applications. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another. A service endpoint can be part of a continuously available service hosted by IIS, or it can be a service hosted in an application. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/whats-wcf)\nIn 2018, there have been quite a few local privilege escalation and remote code execution CVEs related to abusing the functionality exposed by WCF services in .NET programs. These were found in products such as VPN clients, commercial network monitoring tools, and antivirus software. In some cases, these services accidentally exposed stronger capabilities than intended (for example, the ability to run arbitrary code). In other cases, sensitive features have been locked down, but the security mechanisms are faulty and can be bypassed.\nThe aim of this presentation is to spread awareness of WCF as an attack surface, and to demonstrate how to get started finding and exploiting these bugs. This will be accomplished by reviewing the vulnerability identification and exploit development process for a recent 0-day privilege escalation in Check Point's flagship antivirus product ZoneAlarm.","speakers":["christopheranastasio"]},"threeheadsarebetterthanonemasteringnsasghidrareverseengineeringtool":{"presentationTitle":"Three Heads are Better Than One: Mastering NSAâs Ghidra Reverse Engineering Tool","synopsis":"After years of rumblings in the community about NSAâs Ghidra reverse engineering tool, NSA Senior Rob Joyce finally released the tool publicly at RSA in March 2019.\n\nIn this interactive workshop, two experienced reverse engineers will explain everything you need to know to get to work using Ghidra in your offensive research. Weâll start with an overview of Ghidra, then cover the toolâs scripting interfaces for automation. Weâll close with discussion of the toolâs internals, strengths and weaknesses, and highlight community contributions. Knowing our audience, weâll cut to the interesting parts immediately - no explanations of what the stack is or how to recognize a for loop.\n\nSince this workshop is interactive, attendees are strongly recommended to install Ghidra beforehand and ensure that it runs on their systems. Exercise binaries and scripts will be shared closer to the time of the workshop.","speakers":["alexeibulazel","jeremyblackthorne"]},"el3tourgettheultimateprivilegeofandroidphone":{"presentationTitle":"EL3 Tour: Get the Ultimate Privilege of Android Phone","synopsis":"ARM TrustZone technology is widely deployed on modern devices. Current implementations of TrustZone divide the privilege into 4 levels (EL0 to EL3) and 2 worlds (secure and non-secure). Normal world kernel privilege only provides a non-secure-EL1 level of view,\nmany interesting details of the device are still hidden/encrypted in the secure world. Related researches in the past mainly focus on Trusted APP and Kernel. Though some of them managed to gain secure-EL0/EL1 privilege via exploits, very few have touched the field of EL3, especially on Android phones. Starting from non-secure EL1, this talk will take a deep dive into the EL3 implementation of a very popular Android phone. This subjects will include an overview of the relationship between EL3 and 2 worlds; attack surface analysis and the procedure of finding an exploitable vulnerability on this particular device; exploit to run shellcode under EL3 privilege step by step; and finally real-life examples on how powerful the EL3 privilege can be (such as biometric ID methods bypass).","speakers":["guanxingwen"]},"devicedriverdebaucheryandmsrmadness":{"presentationTitle":"Device Driver Debauchery and MSR Madness","synopsis":"On Windows, drivers which pre-date the Windows Driver Model (WDM), also known as legacy drivers, are commonly distributed as components of many software packages. Rather than being tied to a particular piece of hardware these drivers run in kernel space and process developer-defined requests on behalf of usermode processes. Device drivers allow the usermode component(s) to query privileged resources and perform privileged operations. However, this low-level access also means that vulnerabilities in device drivers lead to total system compromise.\n\nThis talk is a case study of a systemic security issue when developing a subset of device drivers based on a previously unexplored exploitation vector: unrestricted or improperly validated access to the privileged Model Specific Register (MSR) instructions. The talk will begin with a review of how to audit device drivers for potential vulnerabilities and how to reliably exploit them if an issue is found, including a discussion of Supervisor Mode Execution Protection (SMEP) and other mitigation bypasses. We will then discuss the specific mechanics of how attacker-controlled MSR access can be exploited and how developers and security vendors can prevent these attacks.\n\nThe exploit primitive discussed in this talk was found in over 15 separate device drivers from different vendors and software packages. Often the software performs similar functionality, and in many cases the code written to exploit one of these device drivers can be reused without any modification to successfully exploit the others. The code similarity across software packages suggests either a lack of industry understanding of the security impact of these privileged operations, or a single piece of incorrect code that has propagated throughout it.","speakers":["ryanwarns","timothyharrison"]},"2pac2furiousenvisioninganioscompromisein2019":{"presentationTitle":"2PAC 2Furious: Envisioning an iOS compromise in 2019","synopsis":"With the introduction of Pointer Authentication Code(PAC) in A12, exploitation became much harder. CFI made forging a valid function pointer, C++ virtual table, or the return address stored on the stack, etc. an almost impossible task for the attacker.  But this task is essential in order to achieve arbitrary memory read/write, or code execution. In this talk, we will describe how PAC is implemented in iOS 12, including key initialization (IA Key, IB Key, DA Key, DB Key, and G Key) and typical use cases to protect different pointers on both user-land and the kernel. We then discuss several possible ways to attack PAC, illustrated by our tests. Since new mitigations are always introduced on the AP (Application Processor) side of iOS, like for example with the new A12 CPU, it's tempting for an attacker to shift focus to other areas. One of those areas is the cellular baseband. The baseband on the new iDevices is now provided by Intel and it is full of surprises. But in particular, it has not the same level of mitigations of the AP, making it attractive as first RCE target. In this talk we will describe this \"\"new\"\" iDevice baseband both in general and in details and ways of attacking it.","speakers":["marcograssi","liangchen"]},"edriscominghideyoshit":{"presentationTitle":"EDR is Coming; Hide yo Shi!t","synopsis":"Thereâs a new, largely unaddressed threat in the security industry today, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), which aims to stop threat actors in their tracks. The scenario plays out like this... At first your campaign is going well and your attacker objectives are being met. Then, your lovingly crafted payloads become analyst samples, youâre evicted from the environment and you lose your persistence. You and the analyst are now having a bad time. You may feel this is just fear mongering, but we assure you, the risk is real.\n\nFortunately, we have a few new tricks up our sleeves to keep this nightmare scenario at bay.  While many would have you believe that we live in a measured and signed boot Utopia on modern systems, we will show you the seedy underbelly of this Brave New World. By abusing early boot mechanisms and UEFI platform firmware, we are able to evade common detection. By showing up early to the fight, we sucker punch EDR, leaving it in a daze unable to see our malicious activities. We put a new twist on old code injection techniques and maintain persistence in UEFI firmware, making an effective invisibility cloak. By leveraging these two techniques, you and the analyst can have a happy and relaxing evening.\n\nFrom that point on - the good olâ days are back again!  Plunder away!","speakers":["michaelleibowitz","tophertimzen"]},"abugslifestoryofasolaris0day":{"presentationTitle":"A Bug's Life: Story of a Solaris 0day","synopsis":"In this talk, I will cover the fascinating story of a Solaris 0day bug discovered 20 (?) years ago and still alive as of today. I intend to show how the original discoverer researched the vulnerable software, how it happened that I stumbled upon his work and rediscovered the vulnerability in 2004, and how it remained unpatched for all these\nyears. A reliable exploit tested on Solaris 10 1/13 (Update 11) will be presented and commented.","speakers":["marcoivaldi"]},"pwningbrowserswithlargescalejavascriptcompilerfuzzing":{"presentationTitle":"Pwning Browsers with Large-Scale JavaScript Compiler Fuzzing","synopsis":"Recent browser exploits show that single vulnerabilities in JavaScript engines still often allow for powerful code execution exploits. Within these engines, just-in-time compilers solve the particularly hard problem of generating highly optimized native code in the presence of dynamic typing and complex language semantics. In a race for performance against competitors, features are added to the compilers at a high rate and make them interesting targets for bug hunting. What often leads to exploitable conditions is the imprecise modeling of subtle JavaScript semantics during aggressive optimization passes, but verifying the different assumptions via manual auditing is a tedious task. We propose that targeted fuzzing that incorporates problematic code patterns can help uncover many such edge cases.\n\nWe show the design of a highly scalable, engine-agnostic fuzzer that generates exotic JavaScript code for stress-testing JIT compilers. With a budget of under $1000 running on 2000 cores, it has produced hundreds of unique crashes across V8, Spidermonkey, JavaScriptCore and ChakraCore, more than 10 of which we managed to exploit reliably. As an example, we will walk through the root cause analysis and exploitation process for a code execution bug that affected the release version of Firefox.","speakers":["brunokeith","niklasbaumstark"]},"havingfunwithcom":{"presentationTitle":"Having FUN with COM","synopsis":"Everyone loves COM, it has so many weird behaviors and features that every time I go digging thereâs more to find. This presentation is a deep-dive into the greatest hits of the past 12 months of me taking COM to task, including the following: execute arbitrary code in a COM process with only memory read access, using esoteric, badly designed, hidden features to escape sandboxes, the continuing story of cross-session exploits, abusing COM marshaling primitives, new methods of persistence, and many more.\n\nSome of these topics are bugs, while fixed will give you an insight\ninto similar bug classes. Other topics are most certainly features\nwhich will be in COM for the foreseeable future.","speakers":["jamesforshaw"]},"fullsteamaheadremotelyexecutingcodeinmoderndesktopapplicationarchitectures":{"presentationTitle":"Full Steam Ahead: Remotely Executing Code in Modern Desktop Application Architectures","synopsis":"Before all desktop applications were web applications pretending to be desktop applications, there was Steam. In September 2018 I achieved XSS, and then RCE in the new Steam Chat client. The client is a cutting-edge React application speaking binary over encrypted WebSockets sitting in Steam's custom version of Chrome Embedded Framework. Through my journey to RCE, I hope to impart some of the most useful techniques I've learned attacking large, minified modern JavaScript applications and reflect on modern application security architecture.","speakers":["thomasshadwell"]}};

Unlike similar courses, this course is not stretched out into 4-5 days. Comprehensive and clear graphical illustrations and a 60 page workbook will help students go from zero to advanced ARM exploit development in only three days. This course includes two real-world IoT targets that we will emulate and exploit. The labs provide real-world scenarios and teach students the process of building and debugging an exploit from an initial memory-corruption crash, and how to bypass exploit mitigations such as NX and ASLR. Rather than ending our NX bypass with a noisy Ret2Libc via the system() api, students will instead learn how to create a reliable ROP chain that marks the stack executable and enables them to take full control of the process directly. The last day of this course will be an introduction to format string vulnerabilities and heap exploitation, followed by a lab where students write an exploit for a heap-based vulnerability. STUDENTS WILL NEED TO BRING THEIR OWN LAPTOP TO USE IN CLASS.","price":"$3,700","syllabus":"### ARM-based IoT Exploitation Development\nCourse Length: 3 Days\n\n#### DAY 1\n\n- ARM 32-bit Architecture\n  * Difference between Architecture and Microarchitecture\n  * ARM processor types\n  * RISC CPU features\n  * Privilege Modes\n  * TrustZone Extension\n  * Memory model, memory types, memory segments\n- ARM Assembly Language\n  * Syntax of Assembly programs\n  * User mode registers and privileged banked registers\n  * Exception handling process\n  * Status registers (CPSR and SPSR)\n  * Conditional execution\n  * Thumb mode\n  * Most common instructions\n  * Data processing instructions\n  * Load immediate restrictions\n  * Literal pool\n  * Load and store instructions\n  * Load and store addressing modes and offset modes\n  * Load and store multiple register processing\n  * Function calls and subroutines (function prologue and epilogue)- Preserving runtime     environment via stack\n- Writing ARM Shellcode\n  * Overview of Shellcode writing process\n  * Tracing system calls and determining Syscall number\n  * Mapping out function parameters\n  * Translation to assembly\n  * Checking for null-bytes and avoiding them\n  * Converting assembly into hex string\n- Lab: Reverse Shell\n  * *Students will translate the following function calls into assembly: socket, connect, execve, dup2. This exercise teaches them how system functions are being invoked in assembly and how to make use of the literal pool when trying to reference strings and values like IP addresses.*\n- Reverse Engineering\n  * Introduction to ELF binaries\n  * Process of gathering information about the binary\n  * Static analysis of ARM functions\n  * Understanding function flow\n  * Debugging with GDB, useful commands\n  * Dynamic analysis of function flow\n- Lab: Debugging with GDB\n  * *Debugging an ARM binary with GDB and analyzing the function flow with guidance of a workbook in which students will answer questions about the binary and learn the process of static and dynamic analysis. This exercise will familiarize the students with the debugging process and prepare them for the exercises that follow.*\n- Memory corruption vulnerabilities\n  * Stack frames\n  * Examples of vulnerable functions\n  * Visualization of a vulnerable function call\n  * Stack corruption\n  * Executing Shellcode on the stack with a simple gadget\n  * Introduction to gadget huntingLab: Exploiting BoF\n  * *In this exercise students will corrupt the stack by exploiting a vulnerable function and create their first exploit in which they identify the offset for the PC crash and leverage a simple gadget to jump to their Shellcode on the stack.*\n- Exploit mitigations\n  * Introduction to the NX bit which makes the stack non-executable\n  * Ways around this restriction\n  * Introduction to Return Oriented Programming\n  * invoking system() via ROP to execute a command - the traditional way\n- Lab: Bypassing NX\n  * *In this exercise, students canât use the traditional way of invoking system(â/bin/shâ), which is only possible with old libraries containing the ideal gadget. This challenge uses a newer Libc library, in which the ideal gadget is not present. This lab challenges students to creatively think about a restriction and come up with a workaround.*\n\n#### DAY 2\n\n- Return Oriented Programming\n  * More detailed explanation of ROP\n  * Gadgets that break your ROP chain\n  * Workaround through register initialization\n  * Noisy vs stealth ways of exploitation\n- Mprotect ROP chains\n  * Technique of making a stack region executable through ROP\n  * Building mprotect ROP chains\n  * How to avoid null-bytes when trying to fill a register with a small value\n  * How to make stack addresses page aligned\n- First target: D-Link DIR890\n  * Process of gaining access to the device via UART and getting shell access to the\n    device.  \n  * Process of extracting and emulation the firmware\n  * The vulnerable service\n- Lab: Bypassing memory-write issue to take over PC\n  * *Taking control over the Program Counter is not always as trivial as supplying a long string of Aâs. Our first target crashes before reaching the PC overwrite. Students need to identify the issue, understand why it occurred, and find a way to bypass this issue in order to continue execution until the PC crash.*\n- Lab: invoking system to get a reverse shell connection\n  * *After bypassing the restriction in the previous lab and gaining control over PC, students are introduced to the easy but noisy way of exploitation. Students will learn how to craft a quick Proof of Concept exploit and learn how to get a back connect without the possibility to execute reverse Shellcode from the stack.*\n- Lab: D-Link mprotect ROP chain\n  * *The goal of this lab is to write an entire mprotect ROP chain. This type of exploit usually involves writing around 60-80 lines of code, 80% of which is the mprotect ROP chain itself. Students will get a deep understanding of building ROP chains of any kind. The exploit is then launched against the vulnerable service to get a shell.*\n- Lab: Bypassing memory-read issue to take over PC\n  * *The goal of the following two labs is to take control over the Tenda router using similar. This lab is yet another example of real world restrictions when attempting to crash the application and take over PC. Students will debug a Tenda buffer overflow and find a way around a memory read issue that prevents the service from crashing in PC.*\n\n#### DAY 3\n\n- Lab: Tenda mprotect ROP chain\n  * *This lab is for students who managed to finish the previous labs ahead of time. The mprotect ROP chain of this target is similar to the previous one, however there are two problems: one part of the D-Link mprotect ROP chain needs to be modified to fit the new target, and the Shellcode needs to be modified to avoid certain characters that would cut off the payload. These characters are returns which pose a problem when exploiting a buffer overflow in a cookie header. Students learn how to think outside the box and adopt their exploit to the new target.*\n- Address Space Layout Randomization\n  * Techniques for bypassing ASLR:\n  * Brute-Force\n  * Partial PC overwrite- Information leaks via string format vulnerabilities\n- Lab: Exploit to bypass ASLR with format string vulnerability\n  * *Students will exploit a buffer overflow and a format string vulnerability. The goal of this lab is to write an exploit that takes advantage of a buffer overflow to get a shell and calculates the Libc base address from an information leak to bypass ASLR.*\n- Introduction to Heap Exploitation\n  * Introduction to the heap\n  * Heap layout\n  * Vulnerability types affecting the heap\n  * Categories of heap vulnerabilities\n  * Concepts and exploitation techniques\n  * Use-after-free\n- Lab: Writing an exploit for a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability\n\n\n**Note:** Syllabus is subject to change","dates":"April 29th - May 1st"},"vector35sreverseengineeringwithbinaryninja":{"id":"75f1632fP7SpISaMfgGanb","title":"Vector 35's Reverse Engineering with Binary Ninja","description":"Ready to be more efficient with the time you spend reverse engineering?

        <div class="TrainingEvent-cpe">21 CPE Credits</div>
        <div class="TrainingEvent-description">This class will cover auditing modern Java applications, exploiting vulnerabilities from a wide variety of vulnerability classes. From the home desktop, to the enterprise, Java is consistently present in ways you would not expect it to be. This class will teach you how to take advantage of the insidious layer of Java bubbling through the cracks of the modern enterprise attack surface.

        <div class="TrainingEvent-cpe">0 CPE Credits</div>
        <div class="TrainingEvent-description">This is a fast-paced course. Unlike similar courses, this course is not stretched out into 4-5 days. Comprehensive and clear graphical illustrations and a 60 page workbook will help students go from zero to advanced ARM exploit development in only three days. This course includes two real-world IoT targets that we will emulate and exploit. The labs provide real-world scenarios and teach students the process of building and debugging an exploit from an initial memory-corruption crash, and how to bypass exploit mitigations such as NX and ASLR. Rather than ending our NX bypass with a noisy Ret2Libc via the system() api, students will instead learn how to create a reliable ROP chain that marks the stack executable and enables them to take full control of the process directly. The last day of this course will be an introduction to format string vulnerabilities and heap exploitation, followed by a lab where students write an exploit for a heap-based vulnerability. STUDENTS WILL NEED TO BRING THEIR OWN LAPTOP TO USE IN CLASS.</div>
