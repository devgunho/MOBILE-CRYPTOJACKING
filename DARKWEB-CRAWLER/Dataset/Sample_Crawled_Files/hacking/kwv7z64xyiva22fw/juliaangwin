Here is a transcript of our exchange:</p>
<p>Q: What sparked your first interest in Bill Binney?</p>
<p>A: I first learned about Bill in 2011 from Jane Mayerâs New Yorker story on NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake.Â  The article focused on the governmentâs effort to prosecute Tom under the Espionage Act.Â  In the article, Bill went on the record for the first time in order to defend Tom.Â  He said something that really struck me â he wanted to apologize to the American people for helping build tools now being used to spy on them.</p>
<p>I got Billâs phone number after reading the article, but it took me a few days to call him. I knew I couldnât call a former top level NSA crypto-mathematician turned whistleblower without flipping a switch. When I finally called, Bill said something like:Â  âYes, Iâll speak to you.Â  Iâm sick and tired of my government breaking the law and harassing me.â</p>
<p>I imagine that conversation is sitting in a data repository somewhere.</p>
<p>Q: At the time that you reached out to Bill, it was difficult to substantiate the allegations he was making. What made him credible to you?</p>
<p>A: There was no question about Billâs position in the NSA.Â  By all accounts, he was a legendary mathematician.Â  His eyewitness account of what happened after 9/11 is very compelling and supported by other reports.</p>
<p>I met Bill on the eve of Tomâs trial in 2011. Bill was eager to testify in Tomâs defense because he wanted to be placed under oath and tell the court what he knew about STELLARWIND &#8211; NSAâs post 9/11 domestic spying program.Â  Bill didnât get the opportunity to testify because the government reduced the charges against Tom from espionage (and 35 years in prison), to a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>I think Bill is still hoping to testify under oath someday.</p>
<p>Q:Â  You published your op-doc about Binney &#8220;The Program&#8221; on August 22, 2012. What prompted you to break off the piece about Binney and publish it prior to your film being completed?</p>
<p>A: I decided to make âThe Programâ for a couple reasons:Â  First, Billâs health was bad and I didnât know how long heâd be with us.Â  He had taken so many risks to speak out that I felt an urgency to make public his warnings.Â  Second, the FISA Amendments Acts (FAA), was up for renewal in December 2012, and there was little public debate or interest about the bill and its renewal.Â  For these two reasons, I felt the story couldnât wait for me to finish the longer film, so I approached the NYT to make the short op-doc.</p>
<p>Q:Â  Is it correct that Edward Snowden reached out to you because of the Binney documentary?</p>
<p>A: I canât speak for Snowdenâs decision-making process, but he did tell me he learned of my interest in NSA surveillance from the op-doc I made about Bill.</p>

Here is our exchange, which was fielded by his legal counsel, Ben Wizner at the ACLU:</p>
<p>Q: In a June Q&amp;A with the Guardian, you were asked about the treatment of Binney and Drake, and you replied &#8220;these draconian responses simply build better whistleblowers.&#8221; Can you elaborate on what you learned from the treatment of Binney and how it has informed your actions?</p>
<p>Snowden: I have tremendous respect for Binney, who did everything he could according to the rules. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for highlighting how the Intelligence Community punishes reporting abuses within the system. If you stay quiet and keep your eyes forward, youâll be taken care of, even if you lie to Congress. If you buck the system, you find armed agents in your bathroom.</p>
<p>Q: One of the points that Binney makes is that not only is dragnet surveillance harmful to civil liberties, but it also overwhelms the NSA analysts who have to sift through it, weakening our intelligence apparatus. Do you agree with that argument?</p>
<p>Snowden: I do. Mass surveillance causes us to miss events like the Boston Bombings because analysts are distracted by low-effort analysis of endless and unfocused chatter rather than the focused, targeted investigation of things like tipoffs from partners. When your working process every morning starts with poking around a haystack of 7 billion innocent lives, you&#8217;re going to miss things like that. We&#8217;re blinding our people with data we don&#8217;t need and it puts us at risk.</p>

<p>By Julia Angwin</p>
<p>LAUSANNE, Switzerlandâ William Binney, creator of some of the computer code used by theÂ National Security AgencyÂ to snoop on Internet traffic around the world, delivered an unusual message here in September to an audience worried that the spy agency knows too much.</p>
<p>It knows so much, he said, that it can&#8217;t understand what it has.</p>
<p>&#8220;What they are doing is making themselves dysfunctional by taking all this data,&#8221; Mr. Binney said at a privacy conference here.</p>
<p>The agency is drowning in useless data, which harms its ability to conduct legitimate surveillance, claims Mr. Binney, who rose to the civilian equivalent of a general during more than 30 years at the NSA before retiring in 2001. Analysts are swamped with so much information that they can&#8217;t do their jobs effectively, and the enormous stockpile is an irresistible temptation for misuse.</p>
<p>Mr. Binney&#8217;s warning has gotten far less attention than legal questions raised by leaks from former NSA contractorÂ Edward SnowdenÂ about the agency&#8217;s mass collection of information around the world. Those revelations unleashed a re-examination of the spy agency&#8217;s aggressive tactics.</p>

<p>Top U.S. intelligence officials gathered in the White House Situation Room in March to debate a controversial proposal. Counterterrorism officials wanted to create a government dragnet, sweeping up millions of records about U.S. citizensâeven people suspected of no crime.</p>
<p>Counterterrorism officials wanted to create a government dragnet, sweeping up millions of records about U.S. citizens-even people suspected of no crime. </p>
<p>Not everyone was on board. &#8220;This is a sea change in the way that the government interacts with the general public,&#8221; Mary Ellen Callahan, chief privacy officer of the Department of Homeland Security, argued in the meeting, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p>
<p>A week later, the attorney general signed the changes into effect.</p>
<p>Through Freedom of Information Act requests and interviews with officials at numerous agencies, The Wall Street Journal has reconstructed the clash over the counterterrorism program within the administration of President Barack Obama. The debate was a confrontation between some who viewed it as a matter of efficiencyâhow long to keep data, for instance, or where it should be storedâand others who saw it as granting authority for unprecedented government surveillance of U.S. citizens.</p>

<p>For more than two years, the police in San Leandro, Calif., photographed Mike Katz-Lacabe&#8217;s Toyota Tercel almost weekly. They have shots of it cruising along Estudillo Avenue near the library, parked at his friend&#8217;s house and near a coffee shop he likes. In one case, they snapped a photo of him and his two daughters getting out of a car in his driveway.</p>
<p>Mr. Katz-Lacabe isn&#8217;t charged with, or suspected of, any crime. Local police are tracking his vehicle automatically, using cameras mounted on a patrol car that record every nearby vehicleâlicense plate, time and location.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are they keeping all this data?&#8221; says Mr. Katz-Lacabe, who obtained the photos of his car through a public-records request. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done nothing wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until recently it was far too expensive for police to track the locations of innocent people such as Mr. Katz-Lacabe. But as surveillance technologies decline in cost and grow in sophistication, police are rapidly adopting them. Private companies are joining, too. At least two start-up companies, both founded by &#8220;repo men&#8221;âspecialists in repossessing cars or property from deadbeatsâare currently deploying camera-equipped cars nationwide to photograph people&#8217;s license plates, hoping to profit from the data they collect.</p>
<p>The rise of license-plate tracking is a case study in how storing and studying people&#8217;s everyday activities, even the seemingly mundane, has become the default rather than the exception. Cellphone-location data, online searches, credit-card purchases, social-network comments and more are gathered, mixed-and-matched, and stored in vast databases.</p>

<p>Not so long ago, there was a familiar product called software. It was sold in stores, in shrink-wrapped boxes. When you bought it, all that you gave away was your credit card number or a stack of bills.</p>
<p>Now there are &#8220;apps&#8221;âstylish, discrete chunks of software that live online or in your smartphone. To &#8220;buy&#8221; an app, all you have to do is click a button. Sometimes they cost a few dollars, but many apps are free, at least in monetary terms. You often pay in another way. Apps are gateways, and when you buy an app, there is a strong chance that you are supplying its developers with one of the most coveted commodities in today&#8217;s economy: personal data.</p>

<p>State and federal authorities follow the movements of thousands of Americans each year by secretly monitoring the location of their cellphones, often with little judicial oversight, in a practice facing legal challenges.</p>
<p>Electronic tracking, used by police to investigate such crimes as drug dealing and murder, has become as routine as &#8220;looking for fingerprint evidence or DNA evidence,&#8221; said Gregg Rossman, a prosecutor in Broward County, Fla.</p>
<p>The use of cellphone tracking by authorities is among the most common types of electronic surveillance, exceeding wiretaps and the use of GPS tracking, according to a survey of local, state and federal authorities by The Wall Street Journal.</p>

As the surreptitious tracking of Internet users becomes more aggressive and widespread, tiny start-ups and technology giants alike are pushing a new product: privacy.</p>
<p>Companies including Microsoft Corp., McAfee Inc.âand even some online-tracking companies themselvesâare rolling out new ways to protect users from having their movements monitored online.
