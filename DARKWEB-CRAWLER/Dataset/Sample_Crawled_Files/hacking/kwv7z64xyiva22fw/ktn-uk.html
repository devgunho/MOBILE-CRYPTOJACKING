The scope of the Catalyst includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>primary crop and livestock production, including aquaculture</li>\n<li>non-food uses of crops, excluding ornamentals</li>\n<li>challenges in food processing, distribution or storage, and value addition (such as through a change in the physical state or form of the product)</li>\n<li>improving the availability and accessibility of safe, healthy and nutritious foods</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your project and its outcomes must fit within theÂ <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Official Development Assistance (ODA) criteria</a>.</p>\n<p>Your application must demonstrate how the primary benefit from your project will be a contribution to international development outcomes, specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>enhanced food and nutrition security and</li>\n<li>welfare of the poor in urban and rural areas in developing countries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Activities carried out in the UK must be clearly relevant to delivering impact in a developing country. Any benefits to the UK must be secondary in nature and result from delivering the primary benefit. Your proposal must clearly demonstrate the ways it will impact in developing countries.</p>\n<p>If your project will support crop breeding it must have clear potential for impact at scale, in more than one country.</p>\n<p>DFID are looking to fund a portfolio of projects, across a variety of technologies, markets and technological maturities.</p>\n<p>You can find more detail on the competition

Round 8 sector-specific webinars â 5th April</strong></p>\n<p>KTN is organising three webinars to provide dedicated support to organisations developing projects for Round 8 of the Agri-Tech Catalyst funding scheme, with each webinar focussing on one of the following areas: crop production, livestock and aquaculture, and food systems and nutrition.</p>\n<p>The main focus of the webinars will be to help inform UK participants of the needs of African partners in the areas covered, and African partners of the capabilities of UK partners, to aid consortia building.</p>\n<p>The webinars will provide an overview of the Agri-Tech Catalyst funding programme, and then cover specific issues affecting Crops/Livestock and Aquaculture/Food Systems and Nutrition in Africa.</p>\n<p>To find out more and to

It can be anything from one share, say a single person consultancy owned by the consultant, through to several million shares, such as a multinational. Â These shares can be bought and sold. A place where shares are bought and sold, is known as a stock exchange. Any share that can be sold or bought on a stock exchange is known as a Public share, as in members of the public can buy them. Â Other shares, are called private, as they can only be sold privately.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text_block","title":"Funding escalator","content":"<p>The journey from creation to public flotation has a number of funding stages sometimes referred to as the funding escalator. This is a simplified view and of course there are exceptions, but it gives you an idea of the types of funding available and the expectations of those funders from their investments.</p>\n<p>At creation, your company is likely to be pre-product and pre-customer. You will have a lean operation and your vision and enthusiasm will be the main driving force. We call this stage bootstrapping. The three candidates that you can ask for support are; Family, dear friends and yourself. You are probably paying yourself less than you are worth to save and cover other costs. This funding helps you explore what the product is, who your customers are and what is the market opportunity. With this information, you are in a stronger position for the next stage, angel investors.</p>\n<p>Investment from angels will generally be the first money that is more formally taken. It will include legal paper work, a process of sanity checking, called due diligence and generally a more probing nature that your family and friends were unlikely to have demonstrated. Â Angel money is generally used to complete the product and take it to market.</p>\n<p>The next step is usually venture capital and corporate capital. These people are investing other peopleâs money, for example this might be long term money from an insurance company or retained profits from a large company.</p>\n<p>The final step is for the investor to see a return on their investment. This can be done by selling to a company, known as a trade sale, or via an IPO, Initial Public Offering.</p>\n<p>Lets look at these in more detailâ¦</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text_block","title":"Angel Investing","content":"<p>Angel investors are generally high net worth individuals investing their own disposable finance. Making investments into an early stage company is risky business, so the law in the UK requires them to only invest in companies subject to two conditions. The rules change from time to time, but at the start of 2018 Angels had to declare that they had, during the financial year immediately preceding the date in question, an annual income to the value of Â£100,000 or more; or they held, throughout the financial year immediately preceding the date in question, net assets to the value of Â£250,000 or more. Net assets for these purposes do not include things like their primary house, insurance products or pensions products. Alternatively, an angel investor can be someone who has self-declared themselves as a sophisticated investor. This means that they have the expertise, knowledge and information to understand the risks they undertake.</p>\n<p>Because angels have an understanding of the risk, they are often prepared to consider investments at an earlier stage than more formal organisations. They will reduce the risk by using their experience to solve problems and spread this risk by sharing investments with other angels. Where more than one angel invests, this is known as syndication.</p>\n<p>To attract angels to invest in early stage companies, rather than invest elsewhere, the government gives tax breaks in the UK through the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-to-use-the-seed-enterprise-investment-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-for-the-enterprise-investment-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Enterprise Investment Scheme</a>.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text_block","title":"Venture Capital, VCs","content":"<p>Investments made through Venture Capital is with money that is invested on behalf of someone else. The VC needs to demonstrate to their funders that they are making good use of the money trusted to them.</p>\n<p>To provide a simplified example, most VCs are given money to invest for a set period of time, typically ten years. This money could be from, for example, an insurance company. The VC will invest in various companies and at the end of the ten years, will be looking to covert the assets back into cash. The profits from the investments will then be shared between the money supplier and the fund managers. When looking at funds to invest in your business, see whether the fund is still investing in new opportunities.</p>\n<p>You may come across VCs who invest the money they make back into the fund they have been asked to manage. This is known as an evergreen fund and has no end date. Often, they are started with public money to meet certain strategic aims. With all VCs get to understand the aims provided by their stakeholders and what drives their investment decision.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text_block","title":"Corporate Venturing","content":"<p>This is similar to a VC except the money comes from a large company. The investment decisions tend to consider how the start-up can help the parent company, in addition to a simple return on investment. Corporate Venture can be done in a variety of ways, some companies treat the money at armâs length, essentially as a Venture Capital company, complete with the typical ten year fund, others treat it as an internal operation with the investment treated as part of the balance sheet.

href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/the-uks-industrial-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Industrial Strategy</a> sets out the Governmentâs plan to help businesses create better, higher-paying jobs with investment in the skills, industries and infrastructure of the future</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/innovation/industrial-strategy-challenge-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund</a> is designed to ensure that research and innovation takes centre stage in the Industrial Strategy, bringing together the UKâs world-leading research with business to meet the major industrial and societal challenges of our time.</p>\n<p>As part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, the Government is investing up to Â£102.5m in a new <a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/innovation/industrial-strategy-challenge-fund/prospering-from-the-energy-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prospering from the Energy Revolution Challenge </a>(PFER) that will develop cutting-edge capabilities in local energy systems that deliver cleaner, cheaper, energy for consumers, while creating high value jobs for the UK.</p>\n<p>The challenge is about showing people that they can live low-carbon lifestyles in low-carbon places more conveniently and more comfortably. It will revolutionise energy management for consumers through new smart systems that can deliver energy according to the societyâs needs and wants from a modern energy supply that is clean, efficient and affordable. New smart systems can link energy supply, storage and demand patterns across power, heating and transport to improve efficiency, resilience, infrastructure productivity and service to consumers.</p>\n<p>Funding will be invested in three core activities of the programmes:<br />\n1. Smart Local Energy Systems Demonstrators and Designs: it will invest in fast-tracking four practicalÂ local energy systems demonstratorsÂ and 11 whole system design studies, built on local ambition and infrastructure plans, which allow deployment of novel consumer-centric energy systems.<br />\n2.Â Â Innovation Accelerator Fund: commercialise smart local energy system products and services and engage with the best international research and innovation opportunities.<br />\n3.Â Â Integration Services and Research, with the Energy Systems Catapult: providing co-ordination and technical support to demonstration and design projects, alongside a world-leading, multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary smart local energy systems research programme.</p>\n<p>Below is an update on one of the projects that has already been funded by PFER.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Design and concepts: GreenSCIES</strong><br />\nProjectÂ Green SCIESÂ will deliver a concept and design study that confirms the technical and commercial viability of an integrated, local, smart energy network in the London Borough of Islington. The project will evaluate, then optimise, a novel, smart energy system, using whole-system modelling and real-life community energy data. It will determine which business models, legal frameworks and non-technical best practices best facilitate the optimal implementation and operation of the smart energy networks.</p>\n<p>The project team includes <a href=\"https://www.islington.gov.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Islington Borough Council</a>, <a href=\"https://www.carbondescent.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carbon Descent</a>, <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Transport for London</a>, <a href=\"http://Building Energy Solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Building Energy Solutions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engie.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ENGIE UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gridedge.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grid Edge</a> and Carbon Data Resources. This complex consortium brings together skills and expertise from the energy, transport, digital, sustainability and public sectors.</p>\n<p>Islington has the highest population density of local authorities in England and Wales with 13,875 people per km making it an interesting challenge area that could deliver significant energy savings and carbon emissions. This study builds on earlier work by the partners in London Borough of Islington (LBI), whoseÂ <em>Master Plan for Energy Mapping</em>Â confirmed the critical role that district heat networks will play in meeting future energy demands. Such networks ensure communities have access to low-cost, low-carbon energy, addressing fuel poverty in an environmentally responsible way.</p>\n<p>Previous investigations identified the potential of the Caledonian Road neighbourhood for a heat network. It is predominantly residential, with commercial, educational, leisure and light industry.Â Green SCIESÂ would extend the scale of an existing thermal network by adding end-users and supply options to deliver a smart, integrated, thermal/power-grid community-scale energy system, suitable for an urban community of mixed end-users.</p>\n<p>The centre of the interconnected smart energy network is close to a disused London Underground railway station. The network will cover approximately 2 km radial distance from the centre, providing low-carbon energy and mobility to &gt;20,000 residents, commercial and community buildings</p>\n<p>TheÂ Green-SCIESÂ network design includes renewable sources of energy (geothermal, solar PV and water source heat pumps) and secondary thermal sources of energy (waste heat recovery from the London underground, data centres, sewers, substations and a supermarket) combined with a smart district thermal network to distribute low-carbon heating and cooling.</p>\n<p>The network design includes flexibility through demand-side management and energy storage. Smart electricity supply will connect &#8211; and flexibly control &#8211; individual assets, including heat pumps and electric vehicles, in response to the intermittent energy sources. The system integrates thermal and electrical storage (inter-seasonal storage, batteries) to create additional flexibility for the network and smart control for demand-side management.</p>\n<p>The project will also evaluate low/ultra-low temperature configurations to distribute and convert thermal energy; connect a stand-alone building to the smart network, adding additional flexibility to the overall system; evaluate additional alternative energy technologies, including fuel cells, bio CHP, hydrogen production through electrolysis and wind turbines etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For more

application of the mathematical sciences to develop solutions to industry problems from sectors as diverse as agriculture, food production, biotechnology and resource efficiency.</p>\n<p>The Clean and Sustainable Growth study group which will take place in Nottingham from 29 April â 1 May and a range of problems will be tackled by researchers.Â  The second problem has been announced and the organisers, KTN, alongside the University of Nottingham, are looking for researchers to work on the following conundrum:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Improving the process for cryogenic crust-freezing for meatproducts, presented by Cranswick PLC</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cranswick.plc.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cranswick PLC</a> is a leading UK food producer and supplier of premium, fresh and added-value food products. Â To improve appearance in the pack, yield and slicing speed capability, meat products are routinely cooled so that the surface âcrustâ is frozen.</p>\n<p>The current process is for the meat product to be cooled by cold air. Â The movement of the meat product to the production line is thought to be inefficient in terms of labour and energy costs; it is believed Cranswick loses up to 60 % of the energy used to crust-freeze in the first place. Â Cranswick would like to explore processing methods which would bring this cooling time down significantly, potentially using cryogens as the cooling medium.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are a

The aim is to reduce risks, introduce new players and potentially lead to new enterprises. The catalyst mechanism provides an excellent opportunity to use UK agri-tech sector and food-chain skills to support international development and identify new markets for UK technology and skills. It will also help the agri-tech sector in developing countries to source new technology and learn from the world-leading UK sector.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"gallery","gallery":[{"ID":26916,"id":26916,"title":"Agri-Tech Catalyst R8 - 800x450px - website image","filename":"Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image.png","url":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image.png","alt":"","author":"10","description":"","caption":"","name":"agri-tech-catalyst-r8-800x450px-website-image","date":"2019-02-18 16:05:15","modified":"2019-02-20 15:49:33","mime_type":"image/png","type":"image","icon":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/wp/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":800,"height":450,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-150x150.png","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-300x169.png","medium-width":300,"medium-height":169,"medium_large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-768x432.png","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":432,"large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image.png","large-width":800,"large-height":450,"custom-16-9-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-320x180.png","custom-16-9-small-width":320,"custom-16-9-small-height":180,"custom-16-9-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-720x405.png","custom-16-9-medium-width":720,"custom-16-9-medium-height":405,"custom-16-9-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-800x450.png","custom-16-9-large-width":800,"custom-16-9-large-height":450,"custom-16-9-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-800x450.png","custom-16-9-extra-large-width":800,"custom-16-9-extra-large-height":450,"custom-1-1-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-320x320.png","custom-1-1-small-width":320,"custom-1-1-small-height":320,"custom-1-1-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-450x450.png","custom-1-1-medium-width":450,"custom-1-1-medium-height":450,"custom-1-1-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-450x450.png","custom-1-1-large-width":450,"custom-1-1-large-height":450,"custom-1-1-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-450x450.png","custom-1-1-extra-large-width":450,"custom-1-1-extra-large-height":450,"custom-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-320x180.png","custom-small-width":320,"custom-small-height":180,"custom-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image-720x405.png","custom-medium-width":720,"custom-medium-height":405,"custom-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image.png","custom-large-width":800,"custom-large-height":450,"custom-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/Agri-Tech-Catalyst-R8-800x450px-website-image.png","custom-extra-large-width":800,"custom-extra-large-height":450}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text_block","title":"About the Agri-Tech Catalyst â Round 8","content":"<p>There is up to Â£3 million of funding available from the Department for International Development (DFID) for early-stage feasibility studies, mid stage industrial research and late-stage experimental development.

This is because it connects so many drivers for change as well as opportunities &#8211; the need to grow productivity, to be more resource efficient, to embrace new technologies, and to find a way to address labour shortages, to provide traceability and demonstrate value, and to understand consumer behaviour, to name a few. </em></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;This work brings together experts across different sectors including AgriFood, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Digital Marketing, ICT and Industrial Mathematics, as reflected in a number of colleagues involved and contributing towards this event and the follow on discussions that led to this publication. It brought together different communities of businesses, academics, policy makers, and regulators to review what digitalisation means to their work, and what needs to happen to embrace it.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Phil Williams,Â Interim Head of Complex Systems atÂ Knowledge Transfer Network said:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>âWith global markets for agricultural robots and drone technologies forecast to grow from $3 billion in 2016 to $10 billion as early as 2022, now is the time for the UK to take Robotics and AI based agri-tech seriously. Not only are the market opportunities significant, but the benefits across the entire agri-food supply chain are perhaps even more important, with the promise of greater productivity, increased resilience and superior quality of produce being the prize. KTNâs RAI SIG is committed to continue its work with the Agri-food team to build community, build capability and reduce barriers to adoption.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>You can access the paper &#8220;How should we turn data into decisions in AgriFood?&#8221; by L.

By optimising <a href=\"/interests/electronics-sensors-photonics\">sensor</a> placement, results indicated that automated detection of lameness should be feasible. Further Innovate UK supported research has subsequently enabled a world-leading system to be developed and validated. This incorporates wireless, remote activity measurement, with cloud-based real-time analysis and alerting.</p>\n<p>The system is being marketed under the product brand name of â<a href=\"http://www.icerobotics.com/products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CowAlert</a>â, which is now being sold to dairy farmers worldwide. Recent data has shown that farms applying the technology can move from lower to upper quartile productivity in just 12 months.</p>\n<p>In order to improve profitability and sustainability, dairy farmers need to continuously monitor their cattle health, welfare and productivity. Cattle behaviour, such as the amount of time spent lying or standing, can provide a timely and effective measure of health and fertility. For instance, this can identify when cattle are in heat and ready for artificial insemination &#8211; essential as cattle need to calve every year to maintain their milk production. Traditionally this has been achieved by visual assessment of cattle, which is subjective and time-consuming. Intelligent remote monitoring enables precision management of dairy farming. The global value of such technology is estimated at over Â£1bn annually and set to grow substantially through pressure to meet high standards of animal welfare and to reduce environmental impact.</p>\n","image":{"ID":27223,"id":27223,"title":"542 IR 240415","filename":"542-IR-240415.jpg","url":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415.jpg","alt":"","author":"7","description":"","caption":"","name":"542-ir-240415","date":"2019-02-28 10:30:20","modified":"2019-02-28 10:30:36","mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","icon":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/wp/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":7360,"height":4912,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-768x513.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":513,"large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-1024x683.jpg","large-width":1024,"large-height":683,"custom-16-9-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-320x180.jpg","custom-16-9-small-width":320,"custom-16-9-small-height":180,"custom-16-9-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-720x405.jpg","custom-16-9-medium-width":720,"custom-16-9-medium-height":405,"custom-16-9-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-1440x810.jpg","custom-16-9-large-width":1440,"custom-16-9-large-height":810,"custom-16-9-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-2880x1620.jpg","custom-16-9-extra-large-width":2880,"custom-16-9-extra-large-height":1620,"custom-1-1-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-320x320.jpg","custom-1-1-small-width":320,"custom-1-1-small-height":320,"custom-1-1-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-720x720.jpg","custom-1-1-medium-width":720,"custom-1-1-medium-height":720,"custom-1-1-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-1440x1440.jpg","custom-1-1-large-width":1440,"custom-1-1-large-height":1440,"custom-1-1-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-2880x2880.jpg","custom-1-1-extra-large-width":2880,"custom-1-1-extra-large-height":2880,"custom-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-320x214.jpg","custom-small-width":320,"custom-small-height":214,"custom-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-720x481.jpg","custom-medium-width":720,"custom-medium-height":481,"custom-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-1440x961.jpg","custom-large-width":1440,"custom-large-height":961,"custom-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/02/542-IR-240415-2880x1922.jpg","custom-extra-large-width":2880,"custom-extra-large-height":1922}}},{"acf_fc_layout":"quote_block","text":"<p>\"Support from David Telford at the KTN and Innovate UK has provided IceRobotics with an invaluable source of networking and funding which has resulted in successful new collaborations and projects.

Ajay was keen to see how KTN could help Far Composites with its business development plan and reaching out to other companies in the industry to aid growth.</p>\n<p>At that time, Far Composites was starting out on its journey to contact and build networks. KTN was able to help build important partnerships and make the right introductions. For example, KTN arranged for Far to meet with Ultrawise Innovation, a technical consultant in plastics and ultrasonic welding. Ultrawise Innovation, along with Far Composites, the University of Hertfordshire and several other companies, together applied for Innovate UK funding for âRapid polymer to metal jointsâ. Together, the collaboration was awarded Â£133,000. KTN was on hand to help review the application before submission.</p>\n<p>In November 2016, KTN invited Far Composites to take part in a number of exhibitions including the Advanced Engineering show at the National Exhibitions Centre (NEC) in Birmingham. Each year, KTN takes a stand and exhibition area at the show, which has over 700 exhibitors and partners.</p>\n<p>The show and invitation from KTN was a huge milestone for Far Composites and incredibly successful. The company brought along two artefacts to display, including an actual car and chassis, demonstrating the inner workings of its unique technology. Both were well received. At the show, Far Composites was able to raise awareness of its brand, and importantly, gain face-to-face contact with a number of prospective investors.</p>\n","image":{"ID":14798,"id":14798,"title":"CS_Far02","filename":"CS_Far02.jpg","url":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02.jpg","alt":"","author":"7","description":"","caption":"","name":"cs_far02","date":"2018-02-19 10:54:17","modified":"2018-02-19 10:55:50","mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","icon":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/wp/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":800,"height":450,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-300x169.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":169,"medium_large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-768x432.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":432,"custom-16-9-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-320x180.jpg","custom-16-9-small-width":320,"custom-16-9-small-height":180,"custom-16-9-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-720x405.jpg","custom-16-9-medium-width":720,"custom-16-9-medium-height":405,"custom-16-9-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-800x450.jpg","custom-16-9-large-width":800,"custom-16-9-large-height":450,"custom-16-9-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-800x450.jpg","custom-16-9-extra-large-width":800,"custom-16-9-extra-large-height":450,"custom-1-1-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-320x320.jpg","custom-1-1-small-width":320,"custom-1-1-small-height":320,"custom-1-1-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-450x450.jpg","custom-1-1-medium-width":450,"custom-1-1-medium-height":450,"custom-1-1-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-450x450.jpg","custom-1-1-large-width":450,"custom-1-1-large-height":450,"custom-1-1-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-450x450.jpg","custom-1-1-extra-large-width":450,"custom-1-1-extra-large-height":450,"custom-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-320x180.jpg","custom-small-width":320,"custom-small-height":180,"custom-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_Far02-720x405.jpg","custom-medium-width":720,"custom-medium-height":405}}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text_block","title":"Outcomes","text":"<ul>\n<li>KTN has been able to give Far Composites a profile in the industry which it would have otherwise struggled to achieve</li>\n<li>KTNâs activities in thermoplastic composites and joining of composites have aided Far Composites in its Innovate UK funding</li>\n<li>The opportunity to take part in the NEC Advanced Engineering show and other exhibitions has led to several important contacts being built and potential business leads explored.

We could not have achieved this without the expertise of KTN.</p>\n","credit":"Ann Williams, Head of Care Services, Liverpool City Council"},{"acf_fc_layout":"text_block","title":"How did KTN help?","text":"<p>Liverpool City Councilâs âHelp to Live at Home Serviceâ provides domiciliary care for thousands of residents, via a network of independent providers. Over 40,000 people in Liverpool have a condition that limits their daily activities, either because of age or a long-term illness. Councils are restricted in what they can afford to pay for care provision, so the service needed to be redesigned, using technology to help the carers serve more people without compromising support.</p>\n<p>LCC was already part of Stop and Go (Sustainable Technology for Older People â Get Organised), an EU PPI project which provides co-financing to help councils meet the cost of introducing ICT enabled healthcare services.Commissioning and Contracts Manager Ann Williams was working with The Innovation Agency (previously North West Coast Academic Health Science Network) and Innovate UK, also partners in Stop and Go, when they introduced her to Richard Foggie, Knowledge Transfer Manager for Digital Economy and the Internet of Things.</p>\n<p>The council was tendering for domiciliary care services, and wanted providers to include technology solutions in their offer.Â  However, the organisations involved were resistant to change. Low margins made the initial costs of new ICT solutions off-putting, and many available technologies were not tailored to their needs, so Ann needed to present digital solutions to providers in an accessible way.</p>\n<p>In April 2016, KTN helped organise a âspeed datingâ event at Anfield, sourcing suitable technology businesses and inviting around 50 of them along to demonstrate their products and services and explain how they would work in a care setting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/people/richard-foggie\">Richard Foggie</a> drew on his extensive contacts and sector knowledge to propose companies whose products had real relevance to the industry, and was able to explain the technology in clear terms. He also introduced the day and ensured it ran smoothly, with each provider spending time with each provider.</p>\n<p>The event was such a success that two of the technologies have been adopted already â and they immediately made a huge difference:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.home-carers.co.uk/new-pass-system-gives-mobility-to-care-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PASS system</a>, from Every Life Solutions, an SME business based in Hampshire, digitises care records which can be seen in real time on a phone app downloaded by a patientâs family. Carers can swipe a QR code on entering a home and immediately discover their patientâs name, meal preferences, whether they need any shopping and when they last took tablets or had a dressing change. The system can be managed centrally on screens in call centres, so if a carerâs car breaks down on the way to a visit, a replacement can be sent over immediately, preventing missed appointments.Families can also monitor care via the app so that they know their relative is being taken care of â or can sound the alarm if they are not happy. This is especially valuable if a patient has dementia and cannot correctly recall when they last ate, took medicines or had a visitor.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://caringcloud.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Caring Cloud</a> from Cardiff uses LoRaWAN technology â a Low Power, Wide Area Network for the Internet of Things (IoT) â to provide monitoring in peopleâs homes by putting sensors around the house to check if a patient has been out of bed and eaten, or whether they are waking up and wandering in the night. Initial results have been so good that the council is working with Amazon web services to maximise the potential of LoRaWAN.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Results have been so positive that Liverpool City Council aims to roll out the technology across the whole spectrum of social care and is looking at partnerships with suppliers and more funding options with help from KTN. Neighbouring authorities have also been impressed with the approach and Liverpool is seeking to extend the project to other locations.</p>\n","image":{"ID":14808,"id":14808,"title":"CS_LCC03","filename":"CS_LCC03.jpg","url":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03.jpg","alt":"","author":"7","description":"","caption":"","name":"cs_lcc03","date":"2018-02-19 10:58:12","modified":"2018-02-19 10:59:24","mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","icon":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/wp/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":800,"height":450,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-300x169.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":169,"medium_large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-768x432.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":432,"custom-16-9-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-320x180.jpg","custom-16-9-small-width":320,"custom-16-9-small-height":180,"custom-16-9-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-720x405.jpg","custom-16-9-medium-width":720,"custom-16-9-medium-height":405,"custom-16-9-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-800x450.jpg","custom-16-9-large-width":800,"custom-16-9-large-height":450,"custom-16-9-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-800x450.jpg","custom-16-9-extra-large-width":800,"custom-16-9-extra-large-height":450,"custom-1-1-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-320x320.jpg","custom-1-1-small-width":320,"custom-1-1-small-height":320,"custom-1-1-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-450x450.jpg","custom-1-1-medium-width":450,"custom-1-1-medium-height":450,"custom-1-1-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-450x450.jpg","custom-1-1-large-width":450,"custom-1-1-large-height":450,"custom-1-1-extra-large":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-450x450.jpg","custom-1-1-extra-large-width":450,"custom-1-1-extra-large-height":450,"custom-small":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-320x180.jpg","custom-small-width":320,"custom-small-height":180,"custom-medium":"https://admin.ktn-uk.co.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/CS_LCC03-720x405.jpg","custom-medium-width":720,"custom-medium-height":405}}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text_block","title":"Outcomes","text":"<ul>\n<li>KTN organised an event with Liverpool City Council and provided introductions to relevant technology companies</li>\n<li>Feedback from care providers was very positive â the event, and KTN, helped them to see the possibilities for technology in their sector for the first time</li>\n<li>As a result, Liverpool City Council has so far adopted several digital services, including the PASS system and the LoRaWAN monitoring service</li>\n<li>This has led to significant improvements for both care providers and patients.
