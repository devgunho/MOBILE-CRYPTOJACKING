<P>Here is a compendium of websites hosted at Lightsecond.com:</P>
<P><a href='http://www.w-axis.com/'>W-Axis</a>. I got bored so I made a multiplayer version of tictactoe. Multi-dimentional tictactoe. Multi-dimentional torriodial tictactoe. Tictactoe that makes Lieutenant Commander Data cry and run home. It's in alpha at the moment so <a href='mailto:jesset@gmail.com'>drop me a line</a> with improvement ideas. Thx :)</P>
<P><A HREF='http://bbt8.blogspot.com/'>Bring Back the 80's</A>, weblog of Jesse Thompson, is no longer hosted here. I've moved it to Blogger. You can still see <a href='/bbt8'>the old version</a> until all it's content gets copied.</P>
<P><A HREF='/metastar'>MetaStar</A>, a Homestar Runner fan site</P>
<P><A HREF='/flash'>Flash Work</A>, a slowly evolving section showcasing Jesse's Flash work. He often attemts and fails to get his work published on the popular <a href='http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/'>Albino Blacksheep</a> flash portal, where he goes by the hacker alias "iButton77" and is guilty of virtually every annoying antic that they have a sticky for.</P>
<P><A HREF='passphrase.html'>Passphrases, and random word selector</A>. Inspired by the XKCD comic <A HREF='http://xkcd.com/936/'>Password Strength</A>.</P>
<P><A HREF='ElmAutostereogram/'>Dictionary word stereogram maker</A>. Ever want to see a stereogram that you could print on a VT100 monitor (79x23 characters), made completely out of legitimate dictionary words for the background plus whatever words you'd like as part of your message?</P>
<P>Have you ever made a Javascript Canvas visualization tool to explore the properties of the sums in the Inverse Riemann Zeta function before? <A HREF='pub/riemann.html'>Well, apparently I have</A>. Yay me. xD</P>
