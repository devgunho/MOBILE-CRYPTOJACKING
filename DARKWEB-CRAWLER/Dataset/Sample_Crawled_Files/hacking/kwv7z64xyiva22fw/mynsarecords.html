Together, we have made quite a statement.  MyNSARecords.com users have now mailed 1,341 Freedom of Information Act requests and 197 Motions to Quash.  Judging by the fact that these requests are being assigned case numebrs in the 70,000-range, this means that about 2% of the FOIA requets the NSA has <i>ever</i> received in their 60 year history have been through MyNSARecords.com.  This is awesome.
<br /><br />
As expected, the NSA has begun denying FOIA requests (Denial Letter, <a href="http://www.mynsarecords.com/deny_p1.png" target="_blank">page 1</a>, <a href="http://www.mynsarecords.com/deny_p2.png" target="_blank">page 2</a>, <a href="http://www.mynsarecords.com/deny_p3.png" target="_blank">page 3</a>).  Seemingly fluent in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak" target="_blank">Newspeak</a>, the letter essentially says that they are authorized to collect your information, but admitting to having your information would allow our enemies to know that they have your information.
<br /><br />
I do hope that all of you who receive rejection letters appeal the denial and, if necessary, take the NSA to court.  Their denial reason does not hold up to basic logic, and I think that in light of their public admissions regarding the existence of the spying programs, they will have a very difficult time persuading a federal judge that releasing your records is the release of some kind of national secret.  I will be posting an appeal form shortly (a FOIA "appeal" is a second letter to the agency giving them a final chance to release the documents before suing them) on the front page of the Web site.
<br /><br />
With that said and with this incredible success, MyNSARecords.com will conclude its mailing service such that I may return to focusing on the civil rights issues that I was working on before this scandal broke (namely, <a href="http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com/category/tsa/" target="_blank">TSA abuse</a> and <a href="http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com/category/nypd/" target="_blank">NYPD stop-and-frisk</a>).  I encourge you to continue to submit FOIA requests, Motions to Quash, <i>etc</i>., regardless of whether the government wants to deny them, and will continue to post the forms to do so indefinitely on the front page as well.
<br /><br />
Thanks everyone!
