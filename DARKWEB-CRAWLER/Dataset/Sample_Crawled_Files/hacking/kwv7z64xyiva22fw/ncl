Excerpt:

A culture of advocacy and promotion for aggressive testing may arise when a
biomarker or its sequelae yield financial benefit to drug and device
manufacturers, procedure-based specialties, hospitals, or laboratory testing
services or is increasingly requested by patients. Excessive testing can
also lead to costly and harmful care, including false-positive results,
overdiagnoses, and unnecessary treatments. Economic pressures, obfuscated
intentionally or inadvertently, can drive increased use of biomarkers, a
phenomenon that could be termed `biomarkup'.

The volume of per-patient biomarker measurements for screening, monitoring,
and diagnosing is poised to increase substantially. Furthermore, many of
these tests will be directed at consumers.1 Machine learning algorithms that
will soon drive artificial intelligence in health care require large amounts
of data and involve ever-expanding approaches to passively and actively
capture patient- and clinician-generated data. The affordability of
wearables and other connected devices is leading to continuous streams of
`digital biomarkers' from individuals in their homes. Genomic measures in
clinical care are expanding the number of biomarkers routinely measurable by
a physician from a handful to potentially thousands.

Another excerpt:

Adjusting the threshold of a biomarker for disease definitions may
significantly alter the population labeled with treatable conditions. For
example, the 2013 change in the cholesterol practice guidelines increased
the number of adults eligible for statin therapy by an estimated 12.8
million compared with previous guideline recommendations (Figure A).
With the global statin market approaching $23 billion, this is not a
coincidence.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services levies
financial penalties on health plans in which beneficiaries adhere poorly to
filling their statin prescriptions.

My comment: There have been previous waves of tests that create lots of
false-positive.  Increasing resolution of medical imaging is one big factor;
it led to the fad for whole body scanning.  Nor is this a new problem. 20
years ago Andy Grove preached that &#8220;every man should know his PSA level'',
but PSA screening turned out to have little, or negative, value for men with
no other symptoms of prostate problems. (He wrote an interesting article
about his experiences in 1996, but current data is much better.

  [Editorial comment: False positives and false negatives are always a
  concern, e.g., especially in dealing with Lyme disease, where most of the
  standard tests are inadequate.  However, false, misleading, and incomplete
  information may be even more of a problem.  For example, I might suggest
  that the medical profession seems to have ignored or disputed recent
  findings that low-fat diets and exercise may be much less effective in
  reducing cholesterol than reducing sugar and carbs:
    Sugar Industry's Propaganda Campaign Exposed a Half-Century Later,

Coinomi wallet bug sends users' secret passphrases to Google's Spellcheck
API via HTTP, in plaintext.
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cryptocurrency-wallet-caught-sending-user-passwords-to-googles-spellchecker/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/cryptocurrency-wallet-caught-sending-user-passwords-to-googles-spellchecker/</a>

opening text:

The Coinomi wallet app sends user passwords to Google's spellchecking
service in clear text, exposing users' accounts and their funds to
man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks during which attackers can log passwords
and later empty accounts.

The issue came to light yesterday after an angry write-up by Oman-based
programmer Warith Al Maawali who discovered it while investigating the
mysterious theft of 90 percent of his funds.

Al Maawali says that during the Coinomi wallet setup, when users select a
password (passphrase), the Coinomi app grabs the user's input inside the
passphrase textbox and silently sends it to Google's Spellcheck API service.

&quot;To understand what's going on, I will explain it technically,&quot; Al Maawali
said. &quot;Coinomi core functionality is built using Java programming
language. The user interface is designed using HTML/JavaScript and rendered
using integrated Chromium (Google's open-source project) based browser.&quot;

Al Maawali says that just like any other Chromium-based app, it comes
integrated with various Google-centered features, such as the automatic
spellcheck feature for all user input text boxes.

The issue appears to be that the Coinomi team did not bother to disable this
feature in their wallet's UI code, leading to a situation where all their
users' passwords are leaking via HTTP during the setup process.

Anyone in a position to intercept web traffic from the wallet app would be
able to see the Coinomi wallet app passphrase in cleartext.

Can you trust online reviews? Here's how to find the fakes.
NBC News found thousands of questionable reviews on Amazon, Yelp, Facebook
and Google, and purchased great reviews for a company that never did any
work.

EXCERPT:

The Federal Trade Commission announced a groundbreaking lawsuit Tuesday
against a company it accuses of paying for fake Amazon reviews. But the
agency may have a lot more work to do if it wants to end the scourge of fake
online reviews.

An NBC News investigation found thousands of questionable reviews on Amazon,
Yelp, Facebook and Google&#8212;and showed that it was possible to purchase
hundreds of positive reviews within days for a new company that had never
done any work.

On Google and Facebook, the profile photos of the reviewers helped expose
many questionable reviews

The profiles used the likenesses of such actors and actresses Terry Crews,
Megan Fox, Omari Hardwick and Abigail Breslin. Those celebrities all
confirmed that they did not write the reviews in question.

Jason Brown runs the consumer advocacy website reviewfraud.organd said it's
common for fake reviewers to use images of celebrities&#8212;often by
accident.  &quot;What they'll do is they'll create their account, do a Google
search for headshots and when they're doing that to add it to their account,
they'll get famous people by mistake,&quot; Brown said. [...]

Why &quot;exceptional access&quot; is synonymous with &quot;backdoors for black hats&quot;

Congresspersons will virtue signal all day long about robocalls, but will
NEVER stop robocalls.  Why?  Precisely because Congresspersons utilize
robocalls *themselves* for their own re-election campaigns.

Who else loves robocalls?  Phone companies themselves.  Robocalls run up
lucrative charges on accounts that would otherwise have *zero* traffic and
minimum account charges.

Who else loves robocalls?  NSA/intelligence agencies.  Have a 3-hop or 2-hop
maximum from a &quot;person of interest&quot;?  Any undergraduate computer scientist
can code up an algorithm to provide enough &quot;junk calls&quot; to fill in that
entire &quot;who-called-whom&quot; adjacency matrix so that *every* person is 2 hops
from a &quot;person of interest&quot;.  Robocalls also enable metadata collection by
exercising the SS7 network.  Robocalls enable the testing of &quot;live&quot; phone
numbers which can later be used for SMS message scams and
malware^H^H^H^H^H^H^HNIT (&quot;network investigative technique&quot;) installation.

Of course, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  Exactly the
same techniques utilized by &quot;white hats&quot; can also be utilized by &quot;black
hats&quot; such as criminals and foreign intel agencies.

Let's Destroy Robocalls: Finally, something worse than Donald Trump.

By Gail Collins  March 1, 2019

Congress may have found an issue that all Americans can rally around.
Stopping robocalls.

All right&#8212;a little depressing that it can't be world peace or
affordable health care.  But let's take what we can get.  If our
elected officials could join hands and lead us into a world where
phones are no longer an instrument of torture, maybe it'd give them
enough confidence to march forward and, um, fund some bridge repair.

Everybody has always hated telemarketers, particularly the ones trying
to sell some shady product.  And now the miracles of technology let
them follow you around all day.  When I'm home, I feel as if I spend
half my time blocking robocalls on our landline.  Yet somehow a
different number always pops up, with great news about opportunities
to reinsure my nonexistent car at low prices or acquire a cost-free
knee brace.

The knee brace thing is a scam to get money out of Medicare, but in
order to figure that out you'd have to engage in conversation.
People, do not ever talk on the phone with a stranger wielding free
knee braces.  This can be a life rule.

Things are at least as bad on mobile phones, which were the lucky
recipients of 48 billion robocalls in the United States alone last
year.

Congress has been trying to control the problem at least since 1991,
when it passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  Remember 1991?
&quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; won the Oscar for best picture.  The Dow closed
the year at 3,168.  The point I'm trying to make is that it's been a
while.

At the time the big problem was mainly telemarketers&#8212;actual people
who dialed your actual number and tried to talk you into buying
something.  Under the T.C.P.A.  you could put your name on a national
&quot;do not call&quot; list.  Some observers did worry about the part of the
plan that required the list be maintained by the telemarketers
themselves.

Whoops.  In 2003 Congress gave the job to the Federal Trade
Commission.  Then-President George W.  Bush signed the bill into law,
rejoicing that from then on, when parents were reading to their
children at night, they'd no longer be interrupted by &quot;a stranger with
a sales pitch.&quot;

Then robocalls really took over the world, and one person on the other
side of the planet could push a few buttons and disrupt &quot;Goodnight
Moon&quot; from coast to coast.

The F.T.C. kept saying it could take care of the problem.  (&quot;... you
can count on us ...&quot;)  Then the Federal Communications Commission
created the Robocall Strike Force in 2016.  Great name!  Mediocre
results.

So here we are, tortured phone owners one and all.  Perhaps, like me,
you've accidentally blocked some of your friends without successfully
getting rid of the woman with the free knee brace.  Perhaps you were
like Dr. Gary Pess, a hand surgeon who told The Times's Tara Siegel
Bernard that he stopped answering any calls when he didn't recognize
the number and then discovered one of them was about a person with a
severed thumb.

But good news!  We're getting some action.  I know &quot;Congress is
working on a bill&quot; is not as encouraging as, say, &quot;Let me pour you a
drink and change the subject.&quot;  But still.

In the House, Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey has a
proposal called Stopping Bad Robocalls, which certainly gets to the
point.  Pallone is the chairman of the Committee on Energy and
Commerce and it's fair to say he has a healthy chance of getting
something done.

Things are more problematic in the Senate, which, as you may have
noticed, is barely capable of getting its act together long enough to
salute the flag.  However, Democratic Senator Ed Markey of
Massachusetts&#8212;the man who helped give us that Telephone Consumer
Protection Act in 1991&#8212;has teamed up with Republican Senator John
Thune of South Dakota to sponsor a bipartisan plan.  It's called the
Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act,
which I certainly hope you noticed spells out Traced.  (Or, O.K.,
Traceda if you wanted to be really technical.)

The bill, Markey says, is &quot;a perfect example&quot; of lawmakers from
opposite sides of the aisle getting together and &quot;agreeing we don't
want our wireless devices in our pocket to be called by total
strangers 10, 15 times a day.&quot;

Pretty low bar, yes?  Perhaps someday we will see a liberal from
California and a conservative from Arkansas get together to fight
against people who throw beer bottles out of their car window when
they're in the passing lane on the highway.

But let's not be cynical.  Markey says, &quot;If this bill can't pass then
no bill can pass,&quot; and he's probably right.  You need to root him on,
given that the other option is falling back in your chair and moaning,
&quot;No bill can pass.&quot;  Come on.

The idea is to make telephone companies try much harder to identify
and block slimy robocalls.  And to bring enforcement groups together
to find new ways to prosecute the scammers.  I know it doesn't sound
all that dramatic, but if you want people to stop calling you every
day with offers to repay your student loans, it's a better strategy
than repeatedly screaming &quot;I graduated in 1980!&quot; into the phone.

York edition with the headline: Let's Destroy Robocalls.

Why IBM's &quot;Dear Tech&quot; Ad Is So Enraging

Technology hasn't fallen short of its promise.  Tech companies have.

By Evan Selinger  Feb 26, 201910:55 AM

I thought my disgust at tech companies weaponizing commercials to dull
our sensibilities would hit a long-lasting high after watching the
Amazon Super Bowl commercial. ...

Unfortunately, after seeing IBM's &quot;Dear Tech&quot; ad during the Oscars, I
realized that perhaps the worst is yet to come.  This commercial would
be funny if it were a deliberately ironic self-indictment of how
little has changed for the big tech companies after the techlash.
Instead, the love letter to technology itself, which features folks
rattling off an aspirational wish list, is an insipid gimmick that
does two awful and interrelated things.

The infantilizing ad depicts technology as if it were an autonomous
person, a benevolent Santa Claus figure that can give great products
to all the good little girls and boys if they ask politely.  Mayim
Bialik helps set the tone by writing a letter addressed to &quot;Dear Tech&quot;
on a laptop.  Arianna Huffington quickly makes the conversation more
intimate, saying, &quot;We have a pretty good relationship.&quot;  In short
order, other voices join the chorus to ask questions (such as, &quot;Can we
build A.I. without bias?&quot;) and make declarations (including, &quot;Let's
champion data rights as human rights&quot;) that expand upon Bialik's hope
that the relationship can be even better.  After all, she informs us,
tech &quot;has the potential to do so much more.&quot;

It all sounds nice.  But the message obscures the fact that technology
hasn't fallen short of its promise.  It's recalcitrant tech companies
that need to change.

That includes IBM.  In the fall, it deflected a journalist's questions
about whether it &quot;secretly used footage from NYPD CCTV cameras to
develop surveillance technology that could search for individuals
based on bodily characteristics like age and skin tone.&quot;  Rather than
providing information, it responded with PR about being &quot;absolutely
committed to responsibly advancing new technologies.&quot;

The ad raises the question, &quot;Can we build A.I. without bias?&quot;  It's
especially interesting to think of a variation of the query in
relation to IBM's own marketing strategy for its supercomputer Watson.
What I want to know is: Can tech companies sell A.I. without preying
on our vulnerabilities and biases?

Commercials for Watson personify the natural language speaking
technology as an independent being that can rapidly internalize
massive amounts of human expertise that's embedded in volumes of
scientific reports and apply the knowledge to wisely make complex
medical recommendations.  Debate, however, exists over whether
marketing material led medical practitioners to develop unrealistic
expectations of what the technology can do, how the technology is
programmed, and how hard it would be to set up.  Indeed, a few years
ago, Cory Doctorow slammed the marketing of Watson for Oncology for
being &quot;deceptive.&quot;  Frankly, tough questions should be asked about the
honesty of the entire tech industry every time a product is depicted
as more humanlike than it really is, since anthropomorphism triggers
cognitive biases that can get in the way of us seeing things clearly.

IBM isn't alone in this sunny disingenuousness.  Its competitors also
give lip service to listening to our hopes and dreams while shutting
down criticism that's voiced to make things better.  For instance, Joy
Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, has been
tirelessly campaigning for &quot;fighting bias in algorithms.&quot;  She's
proposed viable solutions, and yet when she made a reasonable case
that Amazon's face analysis technology, Rekognition, &quot;exhibits gender
and racial bias for gender classification,&quot; the company didn't thank
her and her co-author for their service and outline a plan to improve.
Instead, the general manager of artificial intelligence at Amazon Web
Services was overly defensive to the point of being unduly dismissive.

And then there's the problem of platitudes, an issue that's become
pronounced in the discussion over data privacy.  Microsoft CEO Satya
Nadella say his company wants the U.S. to adopt a privacy policy that
treats privacy as a human right and takes its cue from the &quot;fantastic
start&quot; over in Europe with the General Data Protection Regulation.
But that leaves a whole lot of wiggle room for interpreting what it
means to translate human rights values in concrete terms that the U.S.
judicial system actually can enforce.  Skeptics are concerned that the
major tech companies&#8212;not just Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM, but also
Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others--are now pushing for a
watered-down federal privacy framework as a self-serving end run to
pre-empt stronger state laws.

Indeed, this is the basic problem with the feel-good appeal to human
rights in IBM's Dear Tech commercial.  The person who championed the
ideal may very well have specific and uncompromising principles in
mind.  But in the messy world where actual policy is made, plenty of
people who see the world differently can claim to be endorsing the
sound bite.  A commercial like this one can't avoid being an empty
marketing pitch when it represents a contested concept as a clear and
unambiguous wish that technology can magically grant just as easily as
Santa can satisfy a request for a new smartphone.

Imagine seeing a movie starring Arianna Huffington where she improves
human rights and civil rights, reduces poverty, and make STEM fields
less male-dominated simply by having an intense conversation with
technology and letting it know that that we expect more from it.  The
absurdity would make it far more likely to be up for a Razzie than an
Oscar.  Wishy-washy marketing masquerading as a blueprint isn't the
same thing as the C-suite making hard commitments.  That's why,
someday, we should hope the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature
goes to a film that covers the hard work and concrete ethical demands
of the human tech employees who are pushing for responsible
innovation.

Tech Critics Create a Powerful Response to IBM's Oscars Ad

By Evan Selinger  March 01, 20199:25 AM

During the Oscars, IBM ran an ad called &quot;Dear Tech.&quot;  Afterward, I
wrote a piece for Slate explaining my dismay.  The commercial depicts
big challenges--biases of both AI and humans, misunderstandings
between people, data rights, poverty, and male-dominated STEM
fields--as issues for technology itself to fix.  This idealized and
reified narrative loses sight of two fundamental things: Tech
companies are creating some of the key problems here, and ethically
minded tech workers should be commended for their attempts at finding
solutions.

In my essay, I expressed frustration at companies like Amazon for
failing to productively engage with scholars like Joy Buolamwini of
the MIT Media Lab.  Joy and her colleague Deborah Raji conducted
valuable research on face analysis technology and racial bias, but the
folks at Amazon squandered the opportunity to learn from it.

Now, Joy and a great team of collaborators created an alternative to
IBM's ad.  It's a provocative, line-by-line, video counterstatement.
(I admit I'm biased here: Joy is a colleague of mine, and my voice is
among those you'll hear in the video.)

While the original repeats the infantilizing plea &quot;Dear Tech,&quot; this one is
addressed to &quot;Dear Tech Company.&quot;  The cast might not have the star power of
Arianna Huffington and Mayim Bialik, but it consists of people everyone
should be aware of.  This includes Princeton University professor Ruha
Benjamin, author of the upcoming book Race After Technology; Ethan
Zuckerman, director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT; Kade Crockford,
director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts;
NYU professor Meredith Broussard, author of Artificial Unintelligence: How
Computers Misunderstand the World; UCLA professor Safiya Umoja Noble, author
of Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism; MIT
professor Sasha Costanza-Chock, author of the forthcoming book Design
Justice and also faculty associate at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet
and Society at Harvard University; Rediet Abebe, co-founder of Black in AI;
and Kristen Sheets of the Tech Workers Coalition.

The point of this video: These companies do more than sell us goods
and services.  They influence what people believe about issues ranging
from what it means to be human to acceptable standards of eroding
privacy and tolerable displays of asymmetric power.  The most obvious
way that big tech companies influence public policy is through
lobbying.  In 2018, Google spent $21.2 million on lobbying, Amazon
$14.2 million, and Facebook $12.6 million.  But this infusion of money
isn't the only way that technology companies shape culture.  Product
design is a major source of their power, while PR work influences the
public conversation about these products.  The most dangerous message
promoted by the Dear Tech commercial is that socially responsible
technology will be on its way simply because people are asking for it.
This way of characterizing change suggests tech companies aren't
incentivized to promote outcomes that are more self-serving than
giving the public what it deserves.

The new video says, &quot;Let's make time to understand the impact of
technology on people's lives.&quot;  It's a powerful message.  Too bad this
ad doesn't have an Oscars-sized budget behind it.

Robot love? An app to schedule sex? What is wrong with you?
Has humanity taken the abdication of all its natural functions a little too
far?

<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/robot-love-an-app-to-schedule-sex-what-is-wrong-with-you/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/robot-love-an-app-to-schedule-sex-what-is-wrong-with-you/</a>

selected text:

Then I sit down, open my laptop and discover that many people can't wait to
have sex with a robot.  Not only that, but my colleague Greg Nichols even
informs me that robot love will come as surely as the self-driving car and
the lawless government.

I pause to wonder whether I could truly fall in love with a machine.  Yes,
I've quite appreciated a car or two in my time, but not to the extent of
being driven to snog with one.  Yet apparently robots will, at the very
least, soon replace the spontaneous lovers of spring and the blooming
Orchids of Asia.

The reasons offered by experts are painful to behold. We're apparently
rather liberal with our sense of connection with another.  A plausible
fantasy will do just fine for us.

I tried to come to terms with this grave new existence, when my colleague
Jason Perlow unfurled another technological purler.  This is something
called LoveSync. It's an app that helps you schedule sex with your loved
one.  It offers a button by your bedside. When you're in the mood for a
little conjugal in flagrante, you push the button.  If your partner isn't in
the mood to push theirs, nothing happens.  But if they are, carnal joy
ensues.

Because you don't even trust yourself to identify natural human signals
anymore.

May I ask what is wrong with you?

&quot;If you've ever sent off your DNA to an ancestry or health-screening company
for analysis, chances are your DNA data will be shared with third parties
for medical research or even for solving crime, unless you've specifically
asked the company not to do so.

&quot;The point was brought home in late January when it emerged that genetic
genealogy company FamilyTreeDNA was working with the FBI to test DNA samples
provided by law enforcement to help identify perpetrators of violent
crime. Another DNA testing company, 23andMe, has signed a $300m deal with
pharmaceuticals giant GSK to help it develop new drugs.

&quot;But are customers aware that third parties may have access to their DNA

Subaru Recalls Cars as Some Perfumes Cause Malfunctions: Auto maker's recall
could affect up to 2.3 million vehicles after discovering glitches linked to
cosmetics, other household products

TOKYO&#8212;If you drive a Subaru, you may want to avoid wearing perfume or a
sweater treated with fabric softener&#8212;they could prevent the engine from
starting.  Subaru Corp. said Friday it plans to recall as many as 2.3
million Impreza and Forester vehicles world-wide after discovering that
certain chemical compounds released by everyday products such as cosmetics,
fabric softener or car polish could cause parts to malfunction.

These malfunctions could affect a brake-light switch that is also involved
in starting the engine or cause a vehicle-stability warning light to flash
unnecessarily, the Japanese auto maker said. According to the recall notice
Subaru filed with Japanese regulators, these chemicals may create an
insulating layer on the switches that prevents the proper flow of
electricity.

No accidents related to the problems have been reported, the company
said. [...]

in the prototype program, marking Boeing's biggest investment in unmanned
systems outside the U.S. Other defense contractors are also putting more
funding toward autonomous technology, as defense forces around the world
look for cheaper, safer ways to maximize their resources. The Boeing system
includes electronic warfare, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
functions, in addition to operating like a traditional fighter jet. The
aircraft's first flight is expected next year.

Taking a step back for a moment, Apple does qualify this Significant
Locations section by saying that these are encrypted locations and cannot be
read by Apple. We'll have to take their word for that part.  But it's not so
much that they even qualify it like that. What's most surprising to me is
how clearly hidden this section is.

Anyone who has ever built a digital product knows that if you're putting
something seven screens away from the main screen with a series of scrolls,
clicks, and nonobvious names, you're actively trying to hide the content
from the end user.

      Can I turn it&nbsp;off?

If you're uncomfortable with this list, you can simply move the Significant
Locations switch to the off position. But if you really want to wipe it
clean, turn it on, scroll to the bottom of the history, and select Clear
History.

This post is more of an FYI than a serious dig at Apple. At the end of the
day, we are responsible for letting technology creep further and further
into our lives, because we keep valuing its personalized benefits over the
less useful but more private alternate universe.

Do some digging on your own to find out what settings are turned on and
which you've turned off. Find out what settings you can control and what
exactly they're doing. You control your own tech destiny. This is just one
quick PSA about an area of your iPhone you probably hadn't explored too
much. Technology's ability to improve our lives in nearly all aspects is
clear --âbut we as a society are healthiest as a whole when we fully
understand the implications of how and why it all works.

Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, this is an old risk.

Back in the early 80s there was an early neural net (IIRC Igor Aleksander's
WISARD). One use would have been to distinguish between tanks and cars, but
while it worked well in the lab, it failed dismally on the LÃ¼neburg Heath in
north Germany.

Eventually the researchers realised that the training set was of pictures of
tanks on the LÃ¼neburg Heath and pictures of cars from glossy magazines. The
tank pictures had grey sky, whereas the the car pictures were in bright
appealing sunshine, with easily understood consequences.

I wonder if we will ever stop rediscovering the desirability of ensuring
automated systems that can explain their &quot;reasoning&quot;.

Behind the Lion Air Crash, a Trail of Decisions Kept Pilots in the Dark
By James Glanz, Julie Creswell, Thomas Kaplan and Zach Wichter
Feb. 3, 2019
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/world/asia/lion-air-plane-crash-pilots.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/world/asia/lion-air-plane-crash-pilots.html</a>

  In designing the 737 Max, Boeing decided to feed MCAS with data from
  only one of the two angle of attack sensors at a time, depending on which
  of two, redundant flight control computers&#8212;one on the captain's side,
  one on the first officer's side&#8212;happened to be active on that flight.

  That decision kept the system simpler, but also left it vulnerable to a
  single malfunctioning sensor, or data improperly transferred from it&#8212;as
  appeared to occur on the day of the crash.

  There is no evidence that Boeing did flight-testing of MCAS with erroneous
  sensor data, and it is not clear whether the F.A.A. did so. European
  regulators flight-tested the new version of the plane with normal sensor
  data feeding into MCAS but not with bad data, the pilot familiar with the
  European certification process said. [...]

  Older 737s had another way of addressing certain problems with the
  stabilizers: Pulling back on the yoke, or control column, one of which
  sits immediately in front of both the captain and the first officer, would
  cut off electronic control of the stabilizers, allowing the pilots to
  control them manually.

  That feature was disabled on the Max when MCAS was activated&#8212;another
  change that pilots were unlikely to have been aware of. After the crash,
  Boeing told airlines that when MCAS is activated, as it appeared to have
  been on the Lion Air flight, pulling back on the control column will not
  stop so-called stabilizer runaway.

There's a lot more context in the full article.

The infrastructural humiliation of America
Jon Evans, TechCrunch, 3 Feb 2019
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/03/the-infrastructural-humiliation-of-america/">https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/03/the-infrastructural-humiliation-of-america/</a>

I'm flying back to the USA today, and as an infrastructure aficionado, it's
nice to be going home, but I'm dreading the disappointment. I just spent two
weeks in Singapore and Thailand; last year I spent time in Hong Kong and
Shenzhen; and compared to modern Asia, so much American infrastructure is
now so contemptible that it's hard not to wince when I see it.

The USA is nine times wealthier than Thailand, per capita, but I'd far
rather ride Bangkok's SkyTrain than deal with NYC's subway nowadays. I'd
much prefer to fly into Don Muang, Bangkok's ancient second-tier airport --
which was actually closed for years, before being reopened to handle
domestic flights and low-cost airlines&#8212;than the hostile nightmare that is
LAX. And those are America's two primary gateway cities!

So imagine what it's like coming to America from wealthy Asian nations, and
their gleaming, polished, metronomically reliable subways, trains, and
airports. I don't think Americans understand just how that comparison has
become a quiet ongoing national humiliation. If they did, sheer national
(and civic) pride would make them want to do something about it. Instead
there's a learned helplessness about most American infrastructure nowadays,
a wrong but certain belief that it's unrealistic to dream of anything
better.

It's not just those two cities. Compare Boston's T to, say, Taipei, or San
Francisco's mishmash of messed-up systems&#8212;Muni, where I have waited 45
minutes for a T-Third; CalTrain, which only runs every 90 minutes on
weekends; BART, which squandered millions on its useless white-elephant
Milbrae station&#8212;to Shenzhen. And it's not just age; Paris's metro was
inaugurated in 1900, but its well-maintained system continues to run
excellently and expand continuously.

Americans still tend to think of themselves as an example to other
nations. Ha. I assure you, over the last few years nobody has flown from
Seoul or Taipei or Tokyo or Singapore or Hong Kong or Shenzhen into Newark
Airport; taken the AirTrain to the NJ Transit station; waited for the
rattling, decrepit train into the city; walked through the repellent
ugliness of Penn Station to the subway; waited for its ever-increasing
delays; ridden to their destination; and finally emerged into New York City
-- the nation's alpha city! &#8212;still thinking of the USA as anything other
than a counterexample, or maybe a cautionary tale.

This goes beyond transport infrastructure. Airport security measures are
much more sensible in Asia. Payments are increasingly separately structured,
and better, too&#8212;in many places, credit cards (which already barely exist
as a concept in China) are beginning to slowly wither away, replaced by
Alipay and to a lesser extent WeChat Pay. (Not least because an ever-growing
proportion of the tourist population is Chinese rather than Western,
nowadays.)

That's admittedly an example of leapfrogging, not decay, and American
infrastructure does still have some bright spots. American roads are mostly
still superb. Lyft and Uber are much better than their Southeast Asian
equivalent Grab, which, whenever I checked it during this latest trip, was
invariably both slower and more expensive than a taxi (never mind a tuk-tuk)
despite the infamous Thai taxi mafias. International mobile connectivity is
excellent and user-friendly and reasonably priced, at least if you're on
T-Mobile like me, and as an added bonus, due to a technical quirk, mobile
data roaming bypasses China's Great Firewall.

But that doesn't change the fact that the state of much of America's
infrastructure is appalling on its face, and even moreso when compared to
nations which are on paper nowhere near as rich. The money other nations
spend on urban infrastructure (don't even get me started on intercity
trains) is instead siphoned off to somewhere else. It makes the USA&#8212;still
by far the wealthiest country in the world! &#8212;seem like an dying empire,
one beginning to visibly crack and crumble as it is slowly hollowed out from
within.

I certainly hope so, when the chips are flawed enough not to be fit for
purpose&#8212;i.e., run secure servers, run secure laptop software, run secure
cellphone apps.

But Prof. Gus Uht argues that &quot;no public disclosure should be made at all,
until and unless the exploit appears in the wild.&quot;  &quot;it can unnecessarily
ratchet up the public's anxieties.&quot;  &quot;Better yet, don't even tell the world
that such a thing as a 'bomb' exists.  Just knowing that something can be
done is enough to drive others to successful re-invention.&quot;  [Uh, OK; Truman
should have waited for the &quot;quiet&quot; A-bomb, because the most significant
piece of information that the USSR needed was that once they spent $XXX
billion, the damned thing would actually go off.  And we're still

dealing with the blowback from the Stuxnet &quot;victory&quot;.]

<a href="https://www.sigarch.org/lets-keep-it-to-ourselves-dont-disclose-vulnerabilities/">https://www.sigarch.org/lets-keep-it-to-ourselves-dont-disclose-vulnerabilities/</a>

Perhaps Prof. Uht has forgotten the issues he ran on in his campaign for the
Rhode Island House of Representatives in 2012: &quot;I have worked to keep our
local public water system safe and will continue to do so because we can't
afford not to.&quot;

If Prof. Uht had extended his &quot;Let's Keep it to Ourselves: Don't Disclose
Vulnerabilities&quot; attitude to the Flint water crisis, even more children
would have come down with lead poisoning.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131208062116/http://votegusuht.org/issues.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20131208062116/http://votegusuht.org/issues.html</a>

'As Rhode Islanders, we should never fear the air we breathe or have to
worry about exposing our children to toxic chemicals.  Development is fine
when it is monitored and done seamlessly in our community, but not at the
expense of our natural resources.  *I have worked to keep our local public
water system safe and will continue to do so because we can't afford not
to.*'

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis</a>

'[Dr. Marc] Edwards said, &quot;It was the injustice of it all and that the very
agencies that are paid to protect these residents from lead in water, knew
or should've known after June at the very very latest of this year, that
federal law was not being followed in Flint, and that these children and
residents were not being protected.  And ***the extent to which they went to
cover this up*** exposes a new level of arrogance and uncaring that I have

Let's Keep it to Ourselves: Don't Disclose Vulnerabilities
<a href="https://www.sigarch.org/lets-keep-it-to-ourselves-dont-disclose-vulnerabilities/">https://www.sigarch.org/lets-keep-it-to-ourselves-dont-disclose-vulnerabilities/</a>

There are millions of viruses, etc., in the wild today.  Countless new ones
are devised by black-hat hackers all the time.  In order to proactively
defend against new exploits, some white-hatters seek out or create
weaknesses or vulnerabilities and then devise fixes for them.  However, in
some cases, such as Spectre, fixes are not readily apparent, either to the
inventor or the vendor of the target software or hardware.  Regardless of
the existence of a fix or not, the question arises as to what to publicize
or disclose about the vulnerability.  ***We argue that no public disclosure
should be made at all, until and unless the exploit appears in the wild.***

The norm today is to fully disclose vulnerabilities, most often following
the tenets of responsible disclosure.  It is our view that this is not the
best thing to do since it effectively broadcasts weaknesses, and thus aids
and abets black hat hackers as to the best ways to compromise systems.

With the complexity of current hardware and software systems arising from
billions of transistors and millions of lines of code, it is unlikely that
any system will ever be bug-free or vulnerability-free.  There are
effectively an infinite number of unknown vulnerabilities: &quot;Every day, the
AV-TEST Institute registers over 350,000 new malicious programs (malware)
and potentially unwanted applications (PUA).&quot;  What then is the point of
actively 'discovering' new vulnerabilities and disclosing them?  They are
effectively being invented and empower black hats to wreak havoc without
making systems safer.  It is a race to the bottom.  At the same time ***it
can unnecessarily ratchet up the public's anxieties.***

Pros and Cons: Many arguments for full disclosure have been made over the
years, e.g.: Schneier: Full Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities a 'Damned
Good Idea', Hardware Security and references therein, and Reflections on
trusting SGX.  However, they all seem to miss the basic point: if you don't
want to be blown up, you don't tell the world how to make and use a bomb.
Better yet, don't even tell the world that such a thing as a 'bomb' exists.
Just knowing that something can be done is enough to drive others to
successful re-invention.

One argument for full disclosure is that companies will not fix
vulnerabilities unless they are forced to.  However, at the risk of excusing
less-than-ideal behavior, looking at the situation from a company's
point-of-view shows that inattention to a fix may be reasonable.  There are
a plethora of vulnerabilities and bugs that need to be fixed at any given
time, and resources are limited, so where should such resources be
allocated?  Logically, it would be to address the problems having the
highest potential for damage, that is to minimize overall risk.  Those
vulnerabilities presenting the greatest risk are those that are widely known
and have large deleterious effects, that is, just those that have been
disclosed and widely publicized.  If a vulnerability has little affect, no
one will care about it and it will not lead the news.

Even with responsible disclosure it may be the case that a fix cannot be
made quickly, but the vulnerability inventor decides to fully disclose it
anyway, as in the case of Spectre.  In this case users will be exposed for
possibly a long time, if not permanently.  Without an available fix it seems
irresponsible to disclose such a vulnerability in any way, even
'responsibly.'  Such an apparently indefinite delay occurred with Spectre.
It was fully disclosed in January, 2018, and it was not until mid-Summer
that any kind of effective mitigation that did not severely impact
performance was devised, and then not for all processors.  A
counter-argument can be made that mitigations would not have been devised if
there had not been a full disclosure, since potential mitigation-creators
would not have known about it; however, such mitigations might still have
been too late.

Post Mortem: Was/is there a benefit to the Spectre disclosure?  The
implementation of actual exploits is sufficiently complex and
system-dependent that Spectre has not been widely used (yet); see: There is
no evidence in-the-wild malware is using Meltdown or Spectre, Does malware
based on Spectre exist?, oo7: Low-overhead Defense against Spectre Attacks
via Binary Analysis.  We may not be so lucky the next time.  Although
hardware micro-architects are now aware that security needs to be a
first-class design parameter, now black hatters have another vulnerability
dimension to pursue; who knows what they will come up with?  The world has
been shaken up by the disclosure; was that necessary and helpful?

We can't always tell what's going to happen upon a disclosure; doesn't that
mean we should be cautious, play it safe, and thus not disclose?  Isn't that
the engineering way of doing things?  But it could be said that disclosure
IS the safest approach, long term, since microarchitectures will be
hardened.  But isn't the short-term risk too great?  We want to be able to
live to see the long-term.  Besides, with possibly billions of affected and
unfixable processors in the world, there would continue to be risks in the
long-term.

The Bottom Line: It seems like any attribute, hardware or software, can be
used to detect and affect information or control-processes, it's just a
matter of detailed 'discovery' or invention to figure out how.  So let's not
help black hatters speed things up, get there first and really cause
trouble.  Let's just keep it to ourselves.

&quot;Addiction has become another ethical landmine where dopamine hits&#8212;and
how one administers them&#8212;are the key to a company's growth.  E-cigarette
maker Juul Labs, founded in 2017 and now the fastest growing start-up in
history, with a valuation of $38 billion, is largely responsible for a grave
new statistic: about 20 percent of teens have admitted to vaping in
school. In many ways, that shouldn't surprise us.  Juul is the logical
extension of the Silicon Valley growth-hacking playbook: Design a flawless
product, add a dopamine response, stir in some influencers and watch your
product, game or app go viral.&quot;

Technologically-fueled addictions embody covert institutionalized violence
(<a href="https://www.radford.edu/~gmartin/IPPNO%20Doc.html">https://www.radford.edu/~gmartin/IPPNO%20Doc.html</a>)

Regulators and legislators accept them as a relatively harmless means to
satisfy dopamine delivery desire.

Addictive products generate sales taxes, income taxes, and the business
lobby contributes campaign funds to sustain &quot;wrist-slap regulatory
oversight&quot; in exchange for a franchise to exploit human frailty.  Standard

&quot;The machine received good grades, agreeing with the humans about 90 percent
of the time. It was especially effective at identifying neuropsychiatric
conditions and upper respiratory diseases. For acute upper-respiratory
infection, the most common diagnosis in the huge patient group, the AI
system got it right 95 percent of the time. Would 95 percent be good enough?
One of the next questions that needs to be researched, Zhang says, is
whether the system will miss something dire.  The benchmark, he says, should
be how senior physicians perform, which also is not 100 percent.&quot;

&quot;Study Suggests Medical Errors Now Third Leading Cause of Death in the U.S.&quot;

says, &quot;using hospital admission rates from 2013, they extrapolated that
based on a total of 35,416,020 hospitalizations, 251,454 deaths stemmed from
a medical error, which the researchers say now translates to 9.5 percent of
all deaths each year in the U.S.&quot;

&quot;Medical errors&quot; are categorized by a spectrum.

Ten Most Common Medical Errors in the US.&quot;

When a &quot;difference of diagnostic opinion&quot; arises between the silicon-based
physician-assistant (SiMD) and the carbon-based attending physician (CMD),
how are these conflicts resolved? Will a hospital require a &quot;vote&quot; by
multiple CMDs to overrule the SiMD's? What is the protocol?

What happens when both SiMD and CMD diagnostic opinions align, but they are
both wrong, and the patient is given inappropriate treatment? In an
emergency situation where CMD resource is stretched, what priority will be
given to the SiMD's diagnostic findings?

If SiMD's can be shown to reduce medical error rates, then their role as an
adjunct to a physician's judgment may be appropriate.

Wanna know what to store your data on if you want to keep it available?

A USB stick.

There are impressive tales of them surviving, well, pretty much anything.

So here's one more.

A leopard seal ate one.  And pooped it out.  The poop (you can call it scat
if you don't like poop) was collected and then frozen for more than a year.
It was then defrosted and rinsed under a tap to get the big bits out.  One
of the big bits was the USB stick.  It was dried out for a couple of weeks,
and they still accessed a bunch of photos.

(If you've been hanging out around New Zealand beaches with a blue kayak,
you might want to look at the photos ...)

January, and it now appears the change is extending to the iPhone. ...

Update: AT&amp;T has provided the following statement to MacRumors on the new

Japan's minister of cyber-security, Yoshitaka Sakurada, is poised to

The circumvention of trust is a great promise, but it's just not true. Yes,
bitcoin eliminates certain trusted intermediaries that are inherent in other
payment systems like credit cards. But you still have to trust bitcoin --
and everything about it.

Much has been written about blockchains and how they displace, reshape, or
eliminate trust. But when you analyze both blockchain and trust, you quickly
realize that there is much more hype than value. Blockchain solutions are
often much worse than what they replace... [...]

Michael del Castillo. Forbes, 4 Feb 2019, via ACM TechNews, 11 Feb 2019

Last year, a team of open source developers quietly began loading data for
the entire Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains into Google's big data analytics
platform, BigQuery. With assistance from lead developer Evgeny Medvedev,
Google's senior developer advocate for Google Cloud Allen Day created a
suite of sophisticated software to search the data. In the past year, more
than 500 projects were created using these tools, collectively known as
Blockchain ETL (extract, transform, load), designed to do everything from
predicting the price of bitcoin to analyzing wealth disparity among ether
holders. Day demonstrated Blockchain ETL by examining the so-called hard
fork, or an irrevocable split in a blockchain database, which created a new
cryptocurrency&#8212;bitcoin cash&#8212;from bitcoin in the summer of 2017. Using
Google's BigQuery, Day discovered bitcoin cash, rather than increasing
microtransactions, was actually being hoarded among big holders of bitcoin
cash.

Apparently, China's AI system for catching criminals is catching the &quot;wrong&quot;
criminals: high-level corrupt officials

This is one system that the U.S. should import to watch over our own
government officials&#8212;especially those elected to public office and
responsible for all of the government surveillance on ordinary citizens.
Notice how quickly Congress responded to the disclosure of Robert Bork's
movie rental history with the &quot;Video Privacy Protection Act&quot; of 1988.

SCMP, 04-05 Feb 2019
Is China's corruption-busting AI system 'Zero Trust' being turned off
for being too efficient?

Despite being restricted to just 30 counties and cities, artificial
intelligence system has already helped snare 8,721 officials
System cross-references big data to evaluate work and personal lives
of millions of government workers.

Stephen Chen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Stephen.Chen.SCMP">https://www.facebook.com/Stephen.Chen.SCMP</a>

What would you do if you had a machine to catch a thief? If you were a
corrupt Chinese bureaucrat, you would want to ditch it, of course.

Resistance by government officials to a groundbreaking big data experiment
is only one of many challenges as the Chinese government starts using new
technology to navigate its giant bureaucracy.

According to state media, there were more than 50 million people on China's
government payroll in 2016, though analysts have put the figure at more than
64 million&#8212;slightly less than the population of Britain.

To turn this behemoth into a seamless operation befitting the information
age, China has started adapting various types of sophisticated technology.
The foreign ministry, for instance, is using machine learning to aid in risk
assessment and decision making for China's major investment projects
overseas.

Beijing has been developing a nationwide facial recognition system using
surveillance cameras capable of identifying any person, anywhere, around the
clock within seconds. In Guizhou, a cloud system tracks the movements of
every policeman with a live status report.

Major Chinese telecommunication companies such as ZTE have won government
contracts to develop blockchain technology to prevent the modification of
government data by unauthorised people or organisations.

President Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed the necessity of promoting
scientific and technological innovations such as big data and artificial
intelligence (AI) in government reform.

The challenge is implementing that vision on the ground. Look no further
than an anti-corruption AI system dubbed by the researchers working it as
&quot;Zero Trust&quot;.

Jointly developed and deployed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
Chinese Communist Party's internal control institutions to monitor, evaluate
or intervene in the work and personal life of public servants, the system
can access more than 150 protected databases in central and local
governments for cross-reference.

According to people involved in the programme, this allows it to draw
sophisticated, multiple layers of social relationship maps to derive
behaviour analyses of government employees.

This was &quot;particularly useful&quot; in detecting suspicious property transfers,
infrastructure construction, land acquisitions and house demolitions, a
researcher said.

The system is not without its weaknesses, however.

&quot;AI may quickly point out a corrupt official, but it is not very good
at explaining the process it has gone through to reach such a
conclusion,&quot; the researcher said. &quot;Although it gets it right in most
cases, you need a human to work closely with it.&quot;

The system can immediately detect unusual increases in bank savings,
for instance, or if there has been a new car purchase or bidding for a
government contract under the name of an official or one of his family
or friends.

Once its suspicions have been raised it will calculate the chances of
the action being corrupt. If the result exceeds a set marker, the
authorities are alerted.

A computer scientist involved in the programme who asked not to be
named said that at that stage a superior could then contact the person
under scrutiny and perhaps help him avoid &quot;going down the road of no
return with further, bigger mistakes&quot;.

The Zero Trust experiment has been limited to 30 counties and cities,
just 1 per cent of the country's total administrative area. The local
governments involved, including the Mayang Miao autonomous county in
Hunan province, are located in relatively poor and isolated regions
far away from China's political power centres.

Another researcher involved in the programme said the idea was to
&quot;avoid triggering large-scale resistance among bureaucrats&quot;,
especially the most powerful ones, to the use of bots in governance.

Since 2012, Zero Trust has caught 8,721 government employees engaging
in misconduct such as embezzlement, abuse of power, misuse of
government funds and nepotism.

While some were sentenced to prison terms, most were allowed to keep
their jobs after being given a warning or minor punishment.

Still, some governments&#8212;including Mayang county, Huaihua city and Li
county in Hunan&#8212;have decommissioned the machine, according to the
researchers, one of whom said they &quot;may not feel quite comfortable with the
new technology&quot;.

None of the local authorities responded to requests for comment.

Zhang Yi, an official at the Commission for Discipline Inspection of
the Chinese Communist Party in Ningxiang, Hunan province, said his
agency was one of the few still using the system.

&quot;It is not easy&#8212;we are under enormous pressure,&quot; he said, insisting that
the main purpose of the programme was not to punish officials but to &quot;save
them&quot; at an &quot;early stage of corruption&quot;.

&quot;We just use the machine's result as reference,&quot; Zhang said. &quot;We need
to check and verify its validity. The machine cannot pick up the phone
and call the person with a problem. The final decision is always made
by humans.&quot;

Since Xi rose to power in 2012, more than 1.4 million party members
and government employees are estimated to have been disciplined,
including leaders like former security tsar Zhou Yongkang and former
Chongqing strongman Bo Xilai.

A party disciplinary official in Xiushui county, Jiangxi, who took
part in the Zero Trust project said no government officials were
willing to provide the necessary data.

&quot;But they usually comply with a bit of pressure,&quot; said the official,
who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Disciplinary officials need to help scientists train the machine with
their experience and knowledge accumulated from previous cases. For
instance, disciplinary officials spent many hours manually tagging
unusual phenomena in various types of data sets to teach the machine
what to look for.

Some officials might fabricate data, but the machine can compare
information from different sources and flag discrepancies. It can even
call up satellite images, for instance, to investigate whether the
government funding to build a road in a village ended up in the pocket
of an official, the researchers said.

The system is still running in Xiushui, but its fate is
uncertain. Some officials have questioned the machine's right of
access to sensitive databases because there is neither a law nor
regulation authorising a computer or robot to do so.

No wonder the system is being decommissioned by counties and cities
that had signed up, and those still using it are facing enormous
pressure, with the researchers seeing little or no hope of rolling it
out nationwide.

The Zero Trust hump notwithstanding, artificial intelligence's foray
into other government sectors continues as the government is
determined to apply cutting-edge technology to its advantage. AI
clerks, for example, have been recruited in some courts to read case
files and help judges process lawsuits with higher speed and accuracy.

Last month, a court in Shanghai became the first ever in China to use
an AI assistant at a public hearing, Xinhua reported.

The machine, code-named &quot;206&quot;, has the ability to record
conversations, show evidence such as surveillance camera footage when
mentioned by lawyers, and compare testimonies to help judges spot
discrepancies, the report said.

One judge was quoted as saying it would reduce the likelihood of a
wrong verdict.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wants to transform the way it tracks

to achieving that goal runs straight through improved technology, the agency
writes in a regulatory notice. Commissioner Scott Gottlieb even busted out
the &quot;B&quot; word... &quot;We're invested in exploring new ways to improve
traceability, in some cases using the same technologies that can enhance
drug supply chain security, like the use of blockchain. To advance these
efforts, the FDA recently recruited Frank Yiannas, an expert on the use of
traceability technologies in global food supply chains. He'll be working
closely with me on ways for the FDA to facilitate the expansion of such
methods, such as blockchain technology, to further strengthen the U.S. food

electronic product tracing, which provides a step-by-step account of where a
drug product has been located and who has handled it; establish a more
robust product verification to ensure that a drug product is legitimate and
unaltered; and to make sure that any party involved in handling drugs in the
supply chain must have the ability to spot and quarantine and investigate
any suspect drug. We're committed to staying at the forefront of new and

Google and Waze Must Stop Sharing Drunken-Driving Checkpoints, New
York Police Demand
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/nyregion/waze-nypd-location.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/nyregion/waze-nypd-location.html</a>

Google's navigation app Waze is known for providing real-time,
user-submitted reports that advise drivers about potential thorns in their
roadsides.

But one feature has Waze in conflict with law enforcement officials across
the country: how the app marks the location of police officers on the roads
ahead or stationed at drunken-driving checkpoints.

Over the weekend, the New York Police Department, the largest force in the
nation, joined the fray, sending a letter to Google demanding that the tech
giant pull that feature from Waze.

In the letter, which was first reported on by Streetsblog, the Police
Department said that allowing people to share the locations of sobriety
checkpoints impeded its ability to keep streets safe.

&quot;The posting of such information for public consumption is irresponsible
since it only serves to aid impaired and intoxicated drivers to evade
checkpoints and encourage reckless driving,&quot; the department's acting deputy
commissioner for legal matters, Ann P. Prunty, wrote in the
letter. &quot;Revealing the location of checkpoints puts those drivers, their
passengers, and the general public at risk.&quot;

Ms. Prunty added that people sharing the locations of sobriety checkpoints
on Waze might be breaking the law by trying &quot;to prevent and/or impair the
administration&quot; of the state's D.W.I. laws and that the department planned
to &quot;pursue all legal remedies&quot; to stop people from sharing &quot;this
irresponsible and dangerous information.&quot;

It was not immediately clear what legal steps might be taken.

Waze does not allow drivers to specifically identify sobriety checkpoints.
But people who use the app's police reporting feature can leave detailed
comments on the cartoonish icon of a mustachioed police officer that pops
up.

Google said in a statement on Wednesday that safety was a &quot;top priority&quot; and
&quot;that informing drivers about upcoming speed traps allows them to be more
careful and make safer decisions when they're on the road.&quot; ...

In spring, 2017, a teenager walked up behind a woman leaving the Metro in
Northeast Washington DC and put her in a chokehold: &quot;Be quiet,&quot; he said. And
&quot;delete your iCloud.&quot; He grabbed her iPhone 6S and ran away.

Last month, there were a string of similar muggings in Philadelphia In each
of these muggings, the perpetrator allegedly held the victim up at gunpoint,
demanded that they pull out their iPhone, and gave them instructions:
Disable `Find My iPhone', and log out of iCloud.

In 2013, Apple introduced a security feature designed to make iPhones less
valuable targets to would-be thieves. An iPhone can only be associated to
one iCloud account, meaning that, in order to sell it to someone else (or in
order for a stolen phone to be used by someone new) that account needs to be
removed from the phone altogether. A stolen iPhone which is still attached
to the original owner's iCloud account is worthless for personal use or
reselling purposes (unless you strip it for parts), because at any point the
original owner can remotely lock the phone and find its location with Find
My iPhone. Without the owner's password, the original owner's account can't
be unlinked from the phone and the device can't be factory reset. This
security feature explains why some muggers have been demanding passwords
from their victims.

There is a crisis of trust in American democracy.

So begins a new report from the Knight Commission on Trust, Media and
Democracy organized by the Aspen Institute. It lays blame on our political
discourse, racial tensions, and technology that gives us all more access to
more commentary and news.  &#8220;In 2018, unwelcome facts are labeled as fake.''
&lt;<a href="http://csreports.aspeninstitute.org/Knight-Commission-TMD/2019/report">http://csreports.aspeninstitute.org/Knight-Commission-TMD/2019/report</a>&gt;

Part of the problem with trust has to do with *the ease of cyber-criminals
to ply their trade*. Once relegated to a dark corner of the Internet, now
many criminals operate in the public view, selling various pieces of
technology such as ready-made phishing kits to seed infections, carders to
collect credit card numbers, botnets and web stressors to deliver DDoS
attacks, and other malware construction kits that require little to no
technical expertise beyond clicking a few buttons on a web form. A new
report from CheckPoint shows that anyone who is willing to pay can easily

Many major companies, like Air Canada, Hollister and Expedia, are recording
every tap and swipe you make on their iPhone apps. In most cases you won't
even realize it. And they don't need to ask for permission.

You can assume that most apps are collecting data on you. Some even monetize
your data without your knowledge. But TechCrunch has found several popular
iPhone apps, from hoteliers, travel sites, airlines, cell phone carriers,
banks and financiers, that don't ask or make it clear&#8212;if at all&#8212;that
they know exactly how you're using their apps.

Worse, even though these apps are meant to mask certain fields, some
inadvertently expose sensitive data.

Apps like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Hotels.com and Singapore Airlines also use
Glassbox, a customer experience analytics firm, one of a handful of
companies that allows developers to embed session-replay technology into
their apps. These session replays let app developers record the screen and
play them back to see how its users interacted with the app to figure out if
something didn't work or if there was an error. Every tap, button push and
keyboard entry is recorded&#8212;effectively screenshotted&#8212;and sent back to
the app developers.

In the wake of the Facetime bug comes news of even more insidious breaches
on your Apple devices.  Yes, *that* Apple, the one that makes so much of
having this &quot;safe&quot; and locked down environment, where you can only run
applications that they have approved, for your own protection.

iOS apps are able to scrape screenshots of, basically, everything you do,
and then send that back to, well, whoever they choose.
<a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/02/08/iphone-apps-record-your-screen-sessions-without-asking/">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/02/08/iphone-apps-record-your-screen-sessions-without-asking/</a> or
<a href="https://is.gd/kPmeUl">https://is.gd/kPmeUl</a>

Without asking.

Without letting you know.

This isn't even a bug.  It seems to be part of the iOS system, and could
have valid uses (although what they are escapes me at the moment).

The fact that Apple, with it's closed and locked down system, allows this
sort of thing is rather disturbing ...

  Inkjet printer manufacturers continue to pioneer imaginative ways to
  create real-world, desktop dystopias that make Black Mirror look
  optimistic by comparison: one such nightmare is HP's &quot;subscription&quot;
  printers where a small amount of money buys you ink cartridges that
  continuously communicate with HP's servers to validate that you're still
  paying for your subscription, and if you cancel, the ink stops working.

Pete Hegseth is a host on the Faux News show &quot;Fox and Friends.&quot;  On Sunday
he said that &quot;My 2019 resolution is to say things on air that I say off
air. I don't think I've washed my hands for 10 years. Really, I don't really
wash my hands ever.&quot;
<a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2019/02/fox-friends-host-says-hasnt-washed-hands-10-years-germs-not-real-thing-cant-see/">https://www.rawstory.com/2019/02/fox-friends-host-says-hasnt-washed-hands-10-years-germs-not-real-thing-cant-see/</a>
or <a href="https://is.gd/dGvgCZ">https://is.gd/dGvgCZ</a>

He doesn't wash his hands because germs aren't real.

Of course, he also says that his lack of hygiene inoculates him, but if germ
theory isn't real, then that doesn't make any sense.

OK, this could just be yet another stupid celebrity story.  Except that it
means that there are people in positions of influence who are that stupid.
And who contribute to things like anti-vax movements while measles epidemics
are raging ...

&gt; Crypto exchange QuadrigaCX seems to be filing for bankruptcy.  It's got
&gt; lots of money--locked up in cryptocurrency &quot;cold storage.&quot;  The password
&gt; was only known to the CEO.  The CEO died in December.

Came across a detailed article positing that QuadrigaCX was simply a Ponzi
or pyramid scheme, but the link now seems to be dead ...

&gt; Debian received a total of 938 CVE's in 2018 with windows 10 only
&gt; receiving 254.

I take your overall point, but dispute the validity of this particular
numerical comparison, since Debian contains over 51,000 packages, the vast
majority of which supply functionality Windows 10 doesn't itself offer (such
as two full-fledged office suites&#8212;LibreOffice and Calligra Suite&#8212;and
multiple e-mail clients).  Moreover, even when there is overlap, Debian
commonly offers far more options, with multiple web browsers, media players,
mail servers, etc.  This approach makes for a relatively broad overall
attack surface, but individual users and hosts will have more limited
exposure depending on what they actually run.

Engineers examining data from Beresheet spacecraft to learn why it rebooted
itself, causing automatic abort of trajectory adjustment needed to get to
the moon.

Priel said the team believes glare from the sun on the the spacecraft's
sensors is making it more difficult than expected for the spacecraft to
orient itself according to the position of the stars. However, he added that
the issue only happens at certain angles, and the team thus far is able to
manipulate the spacecraft to obtain a full reading.

&#8220;The thing with the star tracker is it brought a lot of uncertainties with
the first maneuver,'' said Priel, referring to the successful maneuver on
Sunday. &#8220;At some points, we weren't sure if we should put it off. But we
overcame it, we implemented it, and it was beautiful to see.  During the
[first] maneuver we had online communication&#8212;not immediately, with about
a two-second delay, but we saw it almost real time.

&#8220;It was very exciting to see the main engine turn on and the measurements
and the star navigation system working,'' he said. &#8220;It was exciting and
breathtaking as well.''

In January 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
published the remarkable claim that the airbag deployment crash rate dropped
by almost 40 percent in Tesla passenger vehicles equipped with the Autopilot
Technology Package following the installation of a new driver assistance
system component, Autosteer.  However, our replication of NHTSA's analysis
of the underlying data shows that the Agency's conclusion is not
well-founded.

The calculation of accurate crash rates of this type depend on reliable
counts or estimates of both airbag deployment crashes as well as the mileage
traveled exposing vehicles to the risk of a crash. But after obtaining the
formerly secret, underlying data through a lawsuit filed under the Freedom
of Information Act against the U.S. Department of Transportation, we
discovered that the actual mileage at the time the Autosteer system was
installed appears to have been reported for fewer than half the vehicles
NHTSA studied. For those vehicles that do have apparently exact measurements
of exposure mileage both before and after the system's installation, the
change in crash rates associated with Autosteer is the opposite of that
claimed by NHTSA &ndash; if these data are to be believed.

The overall reduction in the crash rates reported by NHTSA following the
installation of Autosteer is an artifact of the Agency's treatment of
mileage information that is actually missing in the underlying dataset.

Our work illustrates the risks posed by:
* performing statistical analyses in Excel;
* treating missing data in Excel spreadsheets as numeric zeros;
  regulatory capture;
* spending taxpayer dollars on anti-scientific efforts to prevent the
  replication of research done by government agencies at taxpayer expense;
* the lack of an international, comprehensive, open, and trustworthy
  surveillance system for casualties and property damage associated with the
  use of advanced driver-assistance systems.

&#8220;What you're looking at is the world's most expensive refrigerator,'' says
Bob Sutor, head of quantum strategy at IBM, while gesturing at a 20-qubit
quantum computer that company unveiled in January.  Despite its small size,
Rigetti, founded by a physicist who previously built quantum computers at
IBM, believes it can challenge the titans.  The company sells a quantum
computing cloud service to researchers who are racing to be the first to
achieve &#8220;quantum advantage,'' when a quantum computer outperforms a
traditional one. Scientists expect a modest demonstration of superiority in
the next couple of years, though they predict it will take up to 10 years
before the technology can handle any meaningful tasks.

&#8220;People keep asking whether we can build working quantum computers and do
it repeatedly at scale,'' says Rigetti vice president Betsy Masiello.
&#8220;Today, in the market, we have definitively answered, yes. We can build
them, they work, and we can do it in a repeatable fashion at production
level.''

The Russian company that gave the world the iconic AK-47 assault rifle has
unveiled a suicide drone that may similarly revolutionize war by making
sophisticated drone warfare technology widely and cheaply available.

The Kalashnikov Group put a model of its miniature exploding drone on
display this week at a major defense exhibition in Abu Dhabi, the capital of
the United Arab Emirates, where the world's arms companies gather every two
years to show off and market their latest wares. [..]

With its low price, high efficiency, and ease of use, the Kalashnikov rifle
became the weapon of choice for revolutionaries and insurgents around the
world, empowering disgruntled citizens against their governments in Latin
America, Africa and Asia. It remains a potent tool to this day: The Pentagon
purchases secondhand Kalashnikov rifles for its allies in Syria and
Afghanistan, rather than give them more expensive American-made guns.

The Kalashnikov drone&#8212;officially named the KUB-UAV&#8212;will likewise be
simple to operate, effective and cheap, its manufacturers claim - and just
as revolutionary. It will mark &quot;a step toward a completely new form of
combat,&quot; said Sergey Chemezov, chairman of Russia's state-owned Rostec arms
manufacturer, which owns a controlling stake in Kalashnikov, according to
Kalashnikov's news statement on the launch. [...]

The attack threatens users with location-tracking, DoS, fake notifications
and more.  Privacy-breaking flaws in the 4G and 5G mobile protocols could
allow attackers to intercept calls, send fake amber alerts or other
notifications, track location and more, according to a research team from
Purdue University and the University of Iowa.
<a href="https://threatpost.com/5g-security/140664/">https://threatpost.com/5g-security/140664/</a>

In a paper presented at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week, the
researchers explained that the issues arise from weaknesses in the cellular
paging (broadcast) protocol. They started with the fact that when a mobile
device is in its idle, low-power state, it will conserve battery life partly
by polling for pending services only periodically.
<a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/privacy-attacks-to-the-4g-and-5g-cellular-paging-protocols-using-side-channel-information/">https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/privacy-attacks-to-the-4g-and-5g-cellular-paging-protocols-using-side-channel-information/</a>

&#8220;when a cellular device is not actively communicating with a base station,
it enters an idle, low-energy mode to conserve battery power,'' Elisa
Bertino, Omar Chowdhury, Mitziu Echeverria, Syed Rafiul Hussain and Ninghui
Li explained. &#8220;When there is a phone call or an SMS message for the device,
it needs to be notified. This is achieved by the paging protocol, which
strives to achieve the right balance between the device's energy consumption
and timely delivery of services such as phone calls.''

The researchers uncovered three connected types of attacks that use this
paging mechanism. The primary attack, dubbed ToRPEDO (short for TRacking via
Paging mEssage DistributiOn), can be used to verify the location of a
specific device. Attackers could also inject fake paging messages and mount
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the team said.

Two other attacks enabled by ToRPEDO, the IMSI-Cracking attack and PIERCER
(short for Persistent Information ExposuRe by the CorE netwoRk), allow an
adversary to fully uncover the victim's unique International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, if the phone number is known&#8212;opening
the door to targeted user location-tracking.  [...]

Top auto shows are increasingly incorporating technology, along with
hands-on experiences like driving simulators and virtual reality
demos. According to Detroit Auto Dealers Association executive director Rod
Alberts, conventional car shows are changing due to declines in the number
of automakers, as well as year-round model debuts driven by social media and
shorter build times. Automotive Trade Association Executives president
Jennifer Colman said this has forced auto shows to evolve and offer
&quot;interactive apps, ride-and-drives, and other experiences that meet
consumers' needs.&quot; Showcased at the annual auto show in Detroit was a demo
of an autonomous car located in Shanghai, China, controlled remotely from
the Detroit event via an &quot;automated valet&quot; system by Chinese startup ZongMu
Technology. Also on display at the event were intersection accident
prevention solutions from a company named Derq, which connect &quot;smart city&quot;
cameras and sensors to predictive algorithms that can set off audio and
visual alarms in standard and autonomous vehicles.

&quot;Consider computer vision, where deep neural networks have achieved stunning
performance improvements on benchmark image-categorization tasks. Say we
task our computer vision algorithm with correctly labeling images as either
cats or dogs. If the algorithm correctly labels the images, we might
conclude that the underlying deep neural network has learned to distinguish
cats and dogs.

&quot;Now suppose all of the dogs are wearing shiny metallic dog tags and none of
the cats are wearing cat tags. Most likely, the deep neural network didn't
learn to see cats and dogs at all but simply learned to detect shiny
metallic tags. Recent work has shown that something like this actually
underpins the performance of deep neural networks on computer vision
tasks. The explanation may not be as obvious as shiny metallic tags, but
most academic data sets contain analogous unintentional cues that deep
learning algorithms exploit.

&quot;The problem, it turns out, is one of computational misdirection. Adding or
deleting just a few pixels can eliminate a particular cue that the deep
neural network has learned to depend on. More fundamentally, this error
demonstrates that deep neural networks rely on superficial image features
that typically lack meaning, at least to humans.

&quot;That creates an opportunity for serious mischief by bad actors using
targeted adversarial examples. If you're counting on consistent
image recognition for self-driving cars designed to recognize road signs,
for example, or security systems that recognize fingerprints...you're in
trouble.&quot;

Brittle artificial pattern recognition is a more accurate label for AI
deployed in autonomous vehicles, and possibly for diagnostic image scanning,
etc.

Risk: Data set bias and algorithms become sensitized and fragile, unable to
evolve&#8212;learn/adjust&#8212;without human intervention.

Denmark has created a &quot;Tech Ambassador.&quot;  What does he do?
<a href="http://techamb.um.dk/">http://techamb.um.dk/</a>

&quot;TechPlomacy is an acknowledgment of the key role that technology and
digitalisation plays and will increasingly play in the future for
individuals and societies alike.&quot;  But what does he do?

&quot;We need a stronger multi-stakeholder discussion on how we want these new
technologies to shape our societies in the future. This requires us to
rethink the relationship between governments, civil society and the private
sector.&quot;  But what does he do?

&quot;In the view of the Danish Government, this necessitates that we establish a
formal diplomatic platform in order to engage in dialogue and collaboration
on a broad range of topics with the tech-industry. Tech Ambassador Casper
Klynge and his global team will therefore work to build strategic
partnerships and engage directly with tech-hubs, governments, international
organizations, civil society, cities, regions, world-class universities and
other stakeholders. Concrete initiatives cut across foreign and security
policy, including cyber, development policy, export and investment
promotion, and a range of sector policies. The opportunities and challenges
of the technology agenda will be pursued and addressed in bilateral
relations with other countries and in the EU and multilateral fora.&quot;  OK,
there's a lot of talking going on ...

I watched the CBC's interview with Casper Klynge, and it seems he is fairly
knowledgeable about commerce stats and business leaders, but I detect a lack
of any real understanding about technology itself.  And that could be a
problem.  We have, over the years, seen numerous instances of governments
trying to legislate for, or address, problems in technology, only to make
the situation worse because they don't really understand it. [...]

Microsoft Edge lets Facebook run Flash code behind users' backs

selected text:

Google security researcher finds secret whitelist that lets Facebook run
Flash content despite Edge's normal security policies.

The whitelist allows Facebook Flash content to bypass Edge security features
such as the click-to-play policy that normally prevents websites from
running Flash code without user approval beforehand.

Prior to February 2019, the secret Flash whitelist contained 58 entries,
including domains and subdomains for Microsoft's main site, the MSN portal,
music streaming service Deezer, Yahoo, and Chinese social network QQ, just
to name the biggest names on the list.

Microsoft trimmed down the list to two Facebook domains earlier this month
after a Google security researcher discovered several security flaws in
Edge's secret Flash whitelist mechanism.

&quot;So many sites for which I'm completely baffled as to why they're there,&quot;
Fratric said. &quot;Like a site of a hairdresser in Spain.
<a href="http://www.dgestilistas.esdgestilistas.es">http://www.dgestilistas.esdgestilistas.es</a>)?!

  I wonder how the list was formed. And if [the Microsoft Security Response
  Center] knew about it.&quot;

Close on the heels of the Nike shoe that fell apart on camera during a
basketball game, their app for the self-tying shoe seems equally flawed.  At
least they didn't try to put it on the Internet, yet.  The &quot;future of
footwear&quot;, indeed.

So, this is the time of year we renew our &quot;enhanced&quot; medical insurance.  We
pay annually, rather than go through the hassle and cost of the various
&quot;payment plans&quot; available.

For the past five years, at least, the process has been different *every*
*single* *year*.  So, I just go to the HQ office to get it done.

In past years, I could speed up the process (very slightly) by filling out a
form on the back of the bill, noting that I'm paying by credit card, and
giving the credit card details.  (I use a card that I don't use for everyday
transactions.)  This year, when I filled out the form, there was no space
for the credit card number (although there was space for the expiry date and
my signature).  I thought this was rather odd, but ...

So, I get to the office, wait to be called, and finally get called.  This
year a I get a twofer: a trainee is shadowing the agent I'm dealing with.  I
say that I'm here to pay by credit card, and pass over the forms.  The agent
says that they don't take credit card data at customer service anymore, only
over the phone.  But, she says, she knows that sometimes she can get someone
to do it over the phone with her, and she places a call.

While we are waiting to find someone (in accounting?) willing to do this,
I'm chuckling over the silliness of some new policy about credit card
retention.  And, since chuckling is not the reaction they are used to
getting when someone is faced with yet another bureaucratic delay, I have to
explain that I am an infosec maven, and why this type of thing is amusing.
Someone in IT or (more likely) senior management has been terrified by some
new requirement and has instituted a new process that will probably be, at
best, minimally effective.  Is it PCI-DSS?  Is it (more likely) GDPR?  And,
while I'm doing this, I'm getting out my credit card, in preparation, and
placing it on the desk.

The agent, while she is trying to get the right person in accounting, is
looking at a screen which obviously has my account info on it.  She glances
at my card and notes, &quot;So you're using the same card number, but it's got a
new expiry date.&quot;

At which point I just guffawed out loud. The new credit card retention
policy obviously says that you can't write the credit card number on a form,
and can't make space for it on a form, and can't send it through the mail on
a form, but obviously my card number (she said it was only the last three
digits) and card expiry date show up on her screen.  (And, presumably,
somewhere in the back end my complete card number is available.)

Oh, SET?  Twenty years ago the major credit card companies created Secure
Electronic Transactions, a system designed for use of credit cards over the
Internet.  It provided a code to retailers that verified the user had a card
and the charge would be honoured, but never actually gave the vendor the
card number.  (In a way, it was kind of a quick one-time form of digital
currency.)  They got to within three months of rolling out the system when
someone noticed that the only problem SET actually solved was vendor fraud.
But vendor fraud was, basically, a non-issue.  So SET never did get
released.

Well, with all the concern these days about credit card retention and data
breaches, maybe it's time to give SET a second look ...

Every month, thousands of retail websites are targeted by cybercriminals,
who insert a small piece of malicious code that allows them to snatch
customers' credit card information. The hacking technique is
called formjacking, and it's the virtual equivalent of putting a
device on an ATM to skim debit card numbers.

Looking at sample images posted on this article (and others) of this
research, I got the impression that most data was collected in the US
Midwest, at winter.  Did researchers consider pedestrians wearing shorts and
sandals on a Florida beach, or walking briskly on a busy NYC street?

And what is the behavior of pedestrians in other regions of the world, e.g.
France, Italy, the ME, Africa, India?

I'm afraid Mid-US pedestrians are just too well-behaved to become the main
source of data used to teach the AI systems of autonomous vehicles.

Hmmm...

I wonder if the converse holds: &quot;A society which makes laws which are next
to impossible to abide by, and who then doesn't enforce them, must be an
authoritarian regime.&quot;

Now let's see: Who in the U.S. loves to write large numbers of &quot;virtue
signaling&quot; laws, and then does nothing to enforce them?

Would it possibly be the Congressional Democrats, who passed all kinds of
laws to &quot;protect&quot; us ordinary citizens from predatory actions by the
financial industry, and then did *nothing* to enforce these laws during the
Obama administration?

Plastic poses a health risk to humans &quot;at every stage of its lifecycle,&quot; a
shocking international report warned yesterday. It linked plastic to
diseases such as cancer and kidney, heart and reproductive problems.

It declared: &quot;Uncertainties and knowledge gaps undermine a complete
evaluation of health impacts, limit the ability of consumers, communities
and regulators to make informed choices, and heighten both acute and
long-term health risks at all stages of the plastic lifecycle.&quot; It cited
particular concerns about &quot;the health effects of the cumulative exposure to
the mixtures of thousands of chemicals used in food packaging and other
manufactured products&quot;. The report by groups including the US Center for
International Environmental Law and Britain's Exeter University comes amid
growing concerns about the impact of plastic pollution.

The ARD Tagesschau reports that there is a software error in the air-traffic
control system over Germany. They are following up a report by
Deutschlandfunk.

<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/flugsicherung-panne-software-101.html">https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/flugsicherung-panne-software-101.html</a>

The DFS (Deutsche Flugsicherung) uses a system that displays so-called
control strips. The control strips contain information for the air traffic
controllers such as vessel type, route, time of airspace crossing. This
system is not working correctly. The system used in Langen in Hessia is
showing errors, so that the controllers must take more time to inspect what
they are doing. All other systems are said to be operational. This concerns
the airspace from Constance to Kassel and from the French border to
Thuringia.  No other airspaces are said to be affected. Travelers should
expect delays of around 30 minutes.

&quot;That low-to-the-ground design was a plus in 1968, but it has proved to be a
constraint that engineers modernizing the 737 have had to work around ever
since. The compromises required to push forward a more fuel-efficient
version of the plane&#8212;with larger engines and altered aerodynamics&#8212;led
to the complex flight control software system that is now under
investigation in two fatal crashes over the last five months.

&quot;But the decision to continue modernizing the jet, rather than starting at
some point with a clean design, resulted in engineering challenges that
created unforeseen risks.&quot;

Legacy 737 fuselage design constraints led to MCAS development and
deployment decades later, which apparently caused the deadly aircraft
incidents.

Risk: Legacy system feature preservation for economic motives versus a full
redesign to negate technical debt accumulation.

Hardigree also still maintains that the data Exactis aggregated and then
exposed wasn't actually sensitive, and that the outrage over its exposure
was overblown. He says much of it was pulled from sources like public
records and census data. Exactis combined that public information with data
it traded for and bought, with sources ranging from payday loan and auto
companies to surveys to registration forms for business publications.
Hardigree claims that hundreds of small companies possess similar data.  He
argues that anyone can buy a less refined version of the same collection,
what's known as a Consumer Master File, for around $1,000. &quot;This data is out
there, and it always has been out there,&quot; Hardigree says.

But Troy Hunt, the security researcher and data breach expert who manages
HaveIBeenPwned, says that the Exactis data was indeed sensitive enough to
justify the wave of pain that hit the company after its security lapse. He
argues the data is, in fact, sufficiently detailed to contribute to identity
theft, and certainly detailed enough to creep out anyone who finds
themselves in it.

Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique number assigned to all Indian residents. Its
uniqueness is supposed to be guaranteed by the use of biometrics
(fingerprints, iris and photographs). Besides biometrics, the Unique
Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) also collects demographic
information.

Aadhaar is being made compulsory for an increasing number of applications in
India. An extensive household survey conducted by our team [1] revealed
various issues related to this measure, including exclusion problems,
transaction costs, and its impact on corruption.

For example, people experience issues with enrolling [2] for Aadhaar, when
they lose it [3], when they try to link [4] it to the appropriate registry,
when they try to authenticate [5] themselves biometrically, and so on.

More issues are highlighted in this Youtube playlist [6] (not all have
subtitles). The consequences [7] of this range from cancellation or
suspension of benefits, to delays and deaths [8].

A transparency deficit contributes to the EHR catastrophe:

&quot;Entrenched policies continue to keep software failures out of public
view. Vendors of electronic health records have imposed contractual 'gag
clauses' that discourage buyers from speaking out about safety issues and
disastrous software installations&#8212;and some hospitals fight to withhold
records from injured patients or their families.&quot;

Risk: Missing incentives among stakeholders (equipment vendors, EHR vendors,
medical service providers, physicians, administrators) to align and
standardized EHR content/metadata/coding structures, communications, and
platform protocols. Possibly corrected through better regulation,
legislation, or perpwalks.

William Egginton, Mar 17 2019
No. And high schools shouldn't treat it that way.

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/opinion/code-foreign-language.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/opinion/code-foreign-language.html</a>

Maryland's legislature is considering a bill to allow computer coding
courses to fulfill the foreign-language graduation requirement for high
school.  A similar bill passed the Florida State Senate in 2017 (but was
ultimately rejected by the full Legislature), and a federal version proposed
by Senators Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, and Maria Cantwell,
Democrat of Washington, is being considered in Congress.

The animating idea behind these bills is that computer coding has become a
valuable skill. This is certainly true. But the proposal that
foreign-language learning can be replaced by computer coding knowledge is
misguided: It stems from a widely held but mistaken belief that science and
technology education should take precedence over subjects like English,
history, and foreign languages.

As a professor of languages and literatures, I am naturally skeptical of
such a position. I fervently believe that foreign-language learning is
essential for children's development into informed and productive citizens
of the world. But even more urgent is my alarm at the growing tendency to
accept and even foster the decline of the sort of interpersonal human
contact that learning languages both requires and cultivates.

Language is an essential&#8212;perhaps the essential&#8212;marker of our species.
We learn in and through natural languages; we develop our most fundamental
cognitive skills by speaking and hearing languages; and we ultimately assume
our identities as human beings and members of communities by exercising
those languages. Our profound and impressive ability to create complex tools
with which to manipulate our environments is secondary to our ability to
conceptualize and communicate about those environments in natural languages.

The difference between natural and computer languages is not merely one of
degree, with natural languages' involving vocabularies that are several
orders of magnitude larger than those of computer languages. Natural
languages aren't just more complex versions of the algorithms with which we
teach machines to do tasks; they are also the living embodiments of our
essence as social animals. We express our love and our losses, explore
beauty, justice and the meaning of our existence, and even come to know
ourselves all though natural languages.

The irony is that few people appreciate the uniqueness of human language
more than coders working in artificial intelligence, who wrestle with the
difficulty of replicating our cognitive abilities. The computer scientist
Alan Turing noted that the question of whether a machine can think is
incredibly difficult to determine, not least because of the lack of a clear
definition of `thinking'; he proposed investigating instead the more
tractable question of whether a machine can convince a human interlocutor
that it's human&#8212;the so-called Turing test.

One of the important lessons of Turing's test is the reminder that in our
interactions with other people, we are fundamentally limited in how much we
can know about another's thoughts and feelings, and that this limitation and
the desire to transcend it is essential to our humanity.  In other words,
for us humans, communication is about much more than getting information or
following instructions; it's about learning who we are by interacting with
others.

The interpersonal essence of language learning extends to learning as a
whole.  We know that small-group, in-person instruction is more effective
than traditional lectures. We ask questions, are asked in return, and we
learn more, learn faster and retain more when we care about the people we
are interacting with. It's no accident that despite the initial enthusiasm
generated by MOOCs, or massive online open courses, they have in fact been a
major disappointment, with completion rates as low as 5 percent. By
comparison, online courses with smaller groups of students and direct
feedback from the professor show completion rates as high as 85 percent.

  [Furthermore, the types of computer-language skills may be quite different
  from natural-language skills.  For example, computer programming requires
  some intense left-brained activities that learning to *speak* natural
  languages does not, and total-system design and development requires
  synergy between the left-brain and right-brain activities.  (See my
  book chapter,
    Zen and the Art of System Programming: Psychosocial Implications of
    Computer Software Development and Use: Zen and the Art of Computing, in
    Theory and Practice of Software Technology, D. Ferrari, M. Bolognani,
    and J. Goguen (editors), North-Holland, 1983, 221--232.
  However, learning to *write* grammatically in a natural language does
  require more left-brain activity.  Besides, adequate natural-language
  learning (even English for a First Language) seems to be declining
  seriously.  Sloppy use of natural languages seems to be tolerated, whereas
  sloppy use of computer languages is the source of many of the risks in
  RISKS.  The concept of teaching programming as a natural language is
  *really* misguided, for many reasons.  PGN]

NSA FOMO...

Whether you trust Huawei's words or not, at least they give lip service to
&quot;no back doors&quot;, which is more than the 5i's will give.

&quot;Huawei, in other words, hampers US efforts to spy on whomever it wants.&quot;

&quot;Prism, prism on the wall.  Who's the most trustworthy of them all?&quot;

&quot;Huawei has not and will never plant backdoors.  And we will never allow
anyone to do so in our equipment.&quot;

<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8307ce8-36b3-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812">https://www.ft.com/content/b8307ce8-36b3-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812</a>

The US attacks on Huawei betray its fear of being left behind

Proliferation of our technology hampers American efforts to spy on whomever
it wants

Guo Ping February 27, 2019

As a top Huawei executive, I'm often asked why the US has launched a
full-scale assault on us.  The Americans have charged us with stealing
technology and violating trade sanctions, and largely blocked us from doing
business there.  Mike Pence, US vice-president, recently told Nato of &quot;the
threat posed by Huawei&quot;, and Mike Pompeo, secretary of state, warned allies
that using our telecommunications equipment would make it harder for the US
to &quot;partner alongside them.&quot;

On Tuesday at the Mobile World Congress, the industry's largest trade show,
a US delegation led by Ajit Pai, Federal Communications Commission chair,
repeated the call to keep Huawei out of global 5G networks.

Washington has cast aspersions on Huawei for years.  A 2012 report by the
House Intelligence Committee labeled us a threat.  But, until recently,
these attacks were relatively muted.  Now that the US has brought out the
heavy artillery and portrayed Huawei as a threat to western civilisation, we
must ask why.

I believe the answer is in the top secret US National Security Agency
documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013.  Formed in 1952, the NSA
monitors electronic communications, such as email and phone calls, for
intelligence and counter-intelligence purposes.

The Snowden leaks shone a light on how the NSA's leaders were seeking to
&quot;collect it all&quot;&#8212;every electronic communication sent, or phone call made,
by everyone in the world, every day.  Those documents also showed that the
NSA maintains &quot;corporate partnerships&quot; with particular US technology and
telecom companies that allow the agency to &quot;gain access to high-capacity
international fibre-optic cables, switches and/or routers throughout the
world&quot;.

Huawei operates in more than 170 countries and earns half of its revenue
abroad but its headquarters are in China.  This significantly reduces the
odds of a &quot;corporate partnership&quot;.  If the NSA wants to modify routers or
switches in order to eavesdrop, a Chinese company will be unlikely to
co-operate.  This is one reason why the NSA hacked into Huawei's servers.
&quot;Many of our targets communicate over Huawei-produced products,&quot; a 2010 NSA
document states.  &quot;We want to make sure that we know how to exploit these
products.&quot;

Clearly, the more Huawei gear is installed in the world's telecommunications
networks, the harder it becomes for the NSA to &quot;collect it all&quot;.  Huawei, in
other words, hampers US efforts to spy on whomever it wants.  This is the
first reason for the campaign against us.

The second reason has to do with 5G.  This latest generation of mobile
technology will provide data connections for everything from smart factories
to electric power grids.  Huawei has invested heavily in 5G research for the
past 10 years, putting us roughly a year ahead of our competitors.  That
makes us attractive to countries that are preparing to upgrade to 5G in the
next few months.

If the U.S. can keep Huawei out of the world's 5G networks by portraying us
as a security threat, it can retain its ability to spy on whomever it wants.
America also directly benefits if it can quash a company that curtails its
digital dominance.  Hobbling a leader in 5G technology would erode the
economic and social benefits that would otherwise accrue to the countries
that roll it out early.  Meanwhile, a range of US laws, including most
recently the Cloud Act, empowers the US government to compel telecom
companies to assist America's programme of global surveillance, as long as
the order is framed as an investigation involving counter-intelligence or
counterterrorism.

The fusillade being directed at Huawei is the direct result of Washington's
realisation that the US has fallen behind in developing a strategically
important technology.  The global campaign against Huawei has little to do
with security, and everything to do with America's desire to suppress a
rising technological competitor.

&quot;Choose Huawei for greater security&quot;, Says Huawei's Guo Ping

In his keynote address at MWC 2019, Rotating Chairman Guo Ping calls for
global 3rd party assurance to cyber security.

Feb 26, 2019

[Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2019] Guo Ping, Huawei's Rotating
Chairman, calls for international collaboration on industry standards
and appeals to governments across the world to listen to cyber
security experts.  His requests come during a keynote speech at Mobile
World Congress 2019.

Huawei is the first company to deploy 5G networks at scale, Guo said.
His MWC 2019 keynote address - &quot;Bringing you 5G safer, faster,
smarter&quot; - outlined how Huawei has developed the most powerful,
simple, and intelligent 5G networks in the world, and argued that such
innovation is nothing without security.  He urges the industry and
governments to work together and adopt unified cyber security
standards.

Guo Ping, Huawei's Rotating Chairman, made a keynote speech at Mobile
World Congress 2019.

Summary of MWC 2019 keynote address by Guo Ping, Rotating Chairman,
Huawei:

1. Innovation

Guo used the first half of his keynote to outline Huawei's position as
the global leader in 5G but asserted that security is the basis of the
company's commitment to innovation.

* &quot;Huawei is the first company that can deploy 5G networks at scale.
  More importantly, we can deliver the simplest possible sites with
  better performance.&quot;

* &quot;The more we invest in engineering science, the more value we can
  create.  At Huawei, we can bring powerful, simple, and intelligent
  5G networks to carriers anywhere in the world, faster than anyone
  else.  Huawei is the global leader in 5G.  But we understand
  innovation is nothing without security.&quot;

2. Security

In the second half of the keynote, Guo responded to recent allegations
directed at Huawei by the U.S. government and called for fact-based
regulation, referring to the recommendations made by GSMA, the
industry organization for mobile network operators worldwide, for
governments and mobile operators to work together.

* &quot;To build a secure cyber environment for everyone, we need
  standards, we need fact-based regulation, and we need to work
  together.&quot;

* &quot;To build a system that we all can trust, we need aligned
  responsibilities, unified standards, and clear regulation.&quot;

* &quot;I fully agree with recent recommendations: Governments and mobile
  operators should work together to agree upon Europe's assurance
  testing and certification regime.  NESAS is a very good idea and I
  would recommend extending it to the world.&quot;

* &quot;Huawei has not and will never plant backdoors.  And we will never
  allow anyone else to do so in our equipment.&quot;

* The irony is that the US CLOUD Act allows their governmental
  entities to access data across borders.

FULL TEXT: Guo Ping's Keynote at MWC Barcelona 2019

Bringing you 5G safer, faster, smarter

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

It's great to see you all again.

There has never been more interest in Huawei.  We must be doing
something right.

Of course, the past few months have been a challenge for us.  On one
hand, our 5G solutions are widely recognized in the industry.  On the
other hand, there has been a lot of speculation about the security of
our 5G solutions.

Today, I would like to talk about Huawei's latest innovations and our
views on cyber security.

Innovation &#8220; It's all in the details

On the 2018 EU R&amp;D Investment Scoreboard, Huawei ranks number 5
globally.  Last year, we invested more than 15 billion US dollars.

This consistent investment has produced many positive results.
Through nonstop investment, we can keep providing our customers with
new, innovative products and more efficient services.

5G is a perfect example of this.

Powerful.  Simple.  Intelligent.

Huawei is the first company that can deploy 5G networks at scale.
More importantly, we can deliver the simplest possible sites with
better performance.

With 100 megahertz, our 5G can reach more than 14 gigs-per-second;
that's for a single sector.  We are at the leading edge of
performance.

Strong capacity also needs strong transmission equipment.

* If fiber is available, we only need to install a blade, attach one
  fiber, and we can bring bandwidth up to 200 Gbps.  It's incredible.

* If fiber is not available, carriers can use microwave.  However, the
  bandwidth of traditional microwave is only 1 Gbps.  To address this
  problem, we use innovative architecture to boost that bandwidth to
  20 Gbps.

* With our 5G smartphone and CPE, Huawei is able to provide end-to-end
  5G solutions.  We have begun to help carriers deploy 5G at scale.

Proven in field tests and commercial use

Last month, Zealer published a report, saying that Huawei's 5G is 20
times faster than the so-called 5G in the US.  That's in field tests.
In commercial use, it is not 20 times faster, but it's still much,
much faster.  So I fully understand what President Donald Trump said
last week.  The United States needs powerful, faster, and smarter 5G.

In the two charts on the left, we have the results from IMT-2020's
phase 3 tests in China.  As you can see, Huawei is far ahead of the
game when it comes to single site throughput.

The third chart compares the speeds of a commercial 5G network
deployed by several vendors.  This is a real customer network.  On
Huawei 5G, single user speed reaches 1.3 Gbps.

Powerful

Innovation is in the details.

Let's start with capacity.

* For example, with performance algorithm, we can more than triple
  cell throughput.

* For hardware, our 5G chips support 64 channels, the highest in the
  industry.  We have also increased the computing power of these chips
  by 2.5 times.

For microwave, we can support 10 times greater transmission bandwidth
than other solutions on the market.

Little by little, we are pushing the physical limits of our technology.

Simple

We are also making sites as simple as possible, without sacrificing
performance.

For example, if we made 64T antennas with old techniques, one 5G antenna
would be bigger than a door.  Can you imagine installing that?  If we put
one here on the beach, it would be blown down.

To address this issue, we are using new materials.  We have reduced the
number of components by 99%, and with lighter covers, we can reduce weight
by 40%.

These new AAUs are as wide as a backpack and very strong.  They can survive
grade-15 typhoons.  This happened in Shenzhen last year.

Installation is super easy.  We can install them directly on a 4G site, or
even on a lamp pole.  Simple sites greatly reduce carrier CAPEX and OPEX.
In Europe, where space is limited, we can help you save 10,000 euros on site
rental, every site, every year.

Intelligent

In the telecom industry, someone said we are using 5G networks of the 21st
century.  However, network Operation and Maintenance is still in the 18th
century.

Let's look at one figure.  Globally, 70% of network faults are from human
limitations.  To make life easier for carriers, our goal is to build
intelligent networks.

Last October, Huawei launched the world's most powerful AI chips: Ascend 910
and Ascend 310.  We can use these to bring intelligence to all scenarios,
and reduce computing power costs for carrier networks.

Building on these chips, Huawei has developed many algorithms and models for
carrier networks.  With AI, we can increase resource efficiency, make O&amp;M
easier, and reduce power consumption for telecom networks.

Conclusion

The more we invest in engineering science, the more value we can create.

At Huawei, we can bring powerful, simple, and intelligent 5G networks
to carriers anywhere in the world, faster than anyone else.

Mixing business with medicine is ethically horrible.

When healthcare is a business, the more sick people there are (especially
those that need expensive treatments), the more profit there is to be
made. This has many bad consequences:

(1) Managing symptoms is more profitable than curing a disease;

(2) Expensive drugs are more profitable than, for example, recommending
simple changes to diet: so vastly more resources are poured into drug
research than into any other form of cure;

(3) The more unhealthy the population, the more money is to be made.  So
encouraging unhealthy habits is beneficial to a healthcare company.  (It
might be seen as a bit *too* obviously cynical for a healthcare company to
buy a tobacco company and heavily advertise and subsidise tobacco: but there
is a strong business case!)

(4) Tests, tests and more tests! Testing is expensive but can be carried out
on apparently healthy people: so its a good business practice to test for
everything, &quot;just in case&quot;.  If you are lucky, you might even discover some
condition that needs expensive treatment.

Contrast this with universal healthcare and government-funded medical
research.  If you are allocated with a certain budget per person and tasked
with improving health you will have a very different set of priorities.

Not having universal healthcare, the U.S. spends around twice as much per
person, compared to other countries, but millions of people still don't have
any healthcare, and overall the population is less healthy than other first
world countries which do have universal health care.

Is it possible that 500 experts can be found in 50 countries who can compile
an 8,000 plus page report to the effect that we are actually managing our
resources as well as we can to accommodate the expanding world population?

Yes, there *is* a risk here: when a scientific hypothesis (with I presume
its obligatory attendant verification-only studies) is taken as a statement
of reality and a political bandwagon is created onto which all sorts of
famous scientists are keen to hop... rational analysis seems to evaporate.

In my experience, science and technology courses do not pay enough attention
to educating students about the philosophy of science... like, who has time
for THAT kind of stuff in a crowded curriculum, right?  That's the real
risk.

Abstract

Harmful lies are nothing new. But the ability to distort reality has taken
an exponential leap forward with `deep fake' technology. This capability
makes it possible to create audio and video of real people saying and doing
things they never said or did. Machine learning techniques are escalating
the technology's sophistication, making deep fakes ever more realistic and
increasingly resistant to detection. Deep-fake technology has
characteristics that enable rapid and widespread diffusion, putting it into
the hands of both sophisticated and unsophisticated actors. While deep-fake
technology will bring with it certain benefits, it also will introduce many
harms. The marketplace of ideas already suffers from truth decay as our
networked information environment interacts in toxic ways with our cognitive
biases. Deep fakes will exacerbate this problem significantly. Individuals
and businesses will face novel forms of exploitation, intimidation, and
personal sabotage. The risks to our democracy and to national security are
profound as well. Our aim is to provide the first in-depth assessment of the
causes and consequences of this disruptive technological change, and to
explore the existing and potential tools for responding to it. We survey a
broad array of responses, including: the role of technological solutions;
criminal penalties, civil liability, and regulatory action; military and
covert-action responses; economic sanctions; and market developments. We
cover the waterfront from immunities to immutable authentication trails,
offering recommendations to improve law and policy and anticipating the
pitfalls embedded in various solutions.

      [Q: How many hackers does it take to change a light bulb?
       A: Only one, and keep him and it off your network.]

Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | 1 Feb 2019

This smart light bulb could leak your Wi-Fi password.  LIFX smart bulbs
contained vulnerabilities that could be exploited with a little ingenuity
and the help of a hacksaw.

<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-smart-light-bulb-could-leak-your-wi-fi-password/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-smart-light-bulb-could-leak-your-wi-fi-password/</a>

selected text:

LimitedResults used the LIFX mini white as a test product, a $15.99 device
which can be controlled via smartphone to change the temperature and dimness
levels of lighting at home.

After installing the bulb's accompanying app on an Android device and
setting up the Wi-Fi connection, the researcher grabbed a saw to hack his
way into the hardware within.

After exposing the innards of the bulb and wiping away fireproof paste, the
hacker found that the main component of the bulb is an ESP32D0WDQ6
system-on-chip (SoC) manufactured by Espressif.

It didn't take long to solder a few pins to a board in order to connect to
the LIFX hardware, and after this link was established, LimitedResults found
that Wi-Fi credentials were stored in plaintext within the flash memory.

  BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) &#8221; We like to say we're addicted to our phones or an
  app or some new show on a streaming video service.

  But for some people, tech gets in the way of daily functioning and
  self-care. We're talking flunk-your-classes, can't-find-a-job,
  live-in-a-dark-hole kinds of problems, with depression, anxiety and
  sometimes suicidal thoughts part of the mix.

  Suburban Seattle, a major tech center, has become a hub for help for
  so-called `tech addicts', with residential rehab, psychologists who
  specialize in such treatment and 12-step meetings.

&quot;But Rob Carlson, managing director at Bioeconomy Capital, a venture-capital
firm in Seattle, Washington, is skeptical that stopping DNA-synthesis
companies from being exploited will prevent bioterror attacks. 'If you look
at what sorts of biological threats have cropped up to date, this isn't one
of them,' he says. Most attacks have involved the release of existing
pathogens grown in labs; in 2001, for instance, five people in the United
States died and 17 were sickened after receiving anthrax-laced letters.

&quot;Terrorists are more likely to follow the blueprint of published research,
rather than embark on a research project to design new organisms, Carlson
says. He fears that any government efforts to regulate DNA synthesis would
push would-be bioterrorists underground.&quot;

Risk: Ineffective government investment to deter bioweapon deployment by
terrorists.

The FBI is messing with Joanap, a botnet run by a major North Korean
blackhat group.

<a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/02/04/fbi-burrowing-into-north-koreas-big-bad-botnet/">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/02/04/fbi-burrowing-into-north-koreas-big-bad-botnet/</a>

Joanap itself is fairly complicated, with infections being started by an SMB
worm, which then installs the Joanap RAT (Remote Access Trojan).  Command
and control is done via a peer-to-peer distributed network.

Which is where the FBI comes in.  A court in the US granted them permission
to set up fake servers pretending to be controllers on Joanap.  As such,
they could spy on individual machines, collect information, or even install
software (possibly to remove the infections and patch vulnerabilities).

In examining the ethics of active defence, I find this fascinating.

<a href="http://www.infosecbc.org/events/new-calendar-event-2/">http://www.infosecbc.org/events/new-calendar-event-2/</a>

I'm pretty sure than in Canadian law the FBI action would actually be
illegal, which is possibly why they are contacting host governments in the
cases of non-US victims.

(Oh, and remember to patch your systems, which is the only reason the
blackhats were able to build Joanap in the first place ...)

&quot;...molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#8212;a two dimensional material because it is
just three atoms thick&#8212;can act like an antenna to convert radio signals
from wi-fi, cell phones and radio or television broadcasts into power for
wireless devices.

&quot;Palacios says the two-dimensional semiconductor can reap 30 to 50
microwatts from ambient wi-fi signals of about 100 microwatts, enough to
operate pacemakers, hearing aids, strain sensors, communication links and
many low-power IoT objects. Such a system could potentially operate without
a battery, lowering weight and avoiding leakage from a medical implant's
power source inside the body.&quot;

Steer clear of TEMPEST facilities, or low ambient RF environments if you

  On Jan. 19, Grant Thompson, a 14-year-old in Arizona, made an unexpected
  discovery: Using FaceTime, Apple's video chatting software, he could
  eavesdrop on his friend's phone before his friend had even answered the
  call. His mother, Michele Thompson, sent a video of the hack to Apple the
  next day, warning the company of a &quot;major security flaw&quot; that exposed
  millions of iPhone users to eavesdropping. When she didn't hear from Apple
  Support, she exhausted every other avenue she could, including emailing
  and faxing Apple's security team, and posting to Twitter and Facebook. On
  Friday, Apple's product security team encouraged Ms. Thompson, a lawyer,
  to set up a developer account to send a formal bug report. But it wasn't
  until Monday, more than a week after Ms. Thompson first notified Apple of
  the problem, that Apple raced to disable Group FaceTime and said it was
  working on a fix. The company reacted after a separate developer reported
  the FaceTime flaw and it was written about on the Apple fan site
  9to5mac.com, in an article that went viral.

&gt;Last night I literally awoke from a nightmare about my iPhone getting
&gt;hacked, spewing spam and doing other nasty things.  The nightmare was that I
&gt;had no way to shut it off, and no way to disconnect it from the Internet.

Recently, while trying to move from an old iPhone to an iPhone 8 Plus - and
following Apple's online instructions - the newer iPhone froze with the
power ON. The &quot;hold the power button down for a long time&quot; trick didn't
work. For one troubleshooting cycle, the 8+ stayed on-but-frozen for over 60
hours while connected to power.

Luckily, the 8+ doesn't appear to be hacked by anything other than buggy
upgrade software.

Called Apple support&#8212;they gave me another combination of button presses
to unfreeze the phone. Except it took four tries to work.

Apparently Apple changed the forced restart scheme twice since the iPhone's
introduction. But if your phone is frozen, you probably don't have any way
to look up the latest method.

&quot;Thefts involving electronic devices are on the up, and it's clear
manufacturers could do more to make their vehicles secure,&quot; the consumer
organization quoted David Jamieson, the West Midlands police commissioner,
as saying.

However, the U.K.'s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT)
insisted that new cars &quot;are more secure than ever, and the latest technology
has helped bring down theft dramatically with, on average, less than 0.3% of
the cars on our roads stolen.&quot;

&quot;We continue to call for action to stop the open sale of equipment with no
legal purpose that helps criminals steal cars,&quot; said SMMT CEO Mike Hawes.

This has had much coverage in UK newspapers recently, such as this article
from today:

  Claire Duffin, *The Daily Mail*, 28 Jan 2019

  Almost all of the UK's best-selling cars can be 'unlocked in
  minutes' by cheap gadgets bought online as watchdog warns of spike
  in 'keyless thefts'

 * Four out of five of the most popular cars in the UK last year at
   risk of keyless theft.
 * Official figures for the year to September showed car thefts were
   up 10 per cent.
 * In one test consumer watchdog Which? found only the Vauxhall Corsa
   was safe.

<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6638121/Almost-UKs-best-selling-cars-unlocked-minutes-cheap-gadgets-bought-online.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6638121/Almost-UKs-best-selling-cars-unlocked-minutes-cheap-gadgets-bought-online.html</a>

&gt; Almost all of the UK's bestselling cars are at risk of keyless theft, a
&gt; study shows.
&gt; Many new cars now have keyless entry systems, or can have them added as
&gt; an upgrade.
&gt; It allows the driver to open and start the car without using a
&gt; traditional key, as long as the fob is nearby.
&gt;
&gt; But thieves have taken advantage of this new technology. Using two
&gt; devices, known as a relay amplifier and a relay transmitter, they can
&gt; capture electromagnetic signals emitted by key fobs from where they are
&gt; sitting inside the car owner's home.
&gt; Working in pairs, one thief stands by the car with his transmitter,
&gt; while a second waves the amplifier close to the house.
&gt; The amplifier will detect a signal from the key fob, amplify it and send
&gt; it to the accomplice's transmitter.
&gt; This tricks the car into thinking the key is in close proximity,
&gt; prompting it to open. Thieves can then drive the vehicle away using the
&gt; push-button keyless ignition.
&gt; The process can take less than one minute ï¿½ and once they have the car,
&gt; they can quickly replace locks and entry devices.

I'm guessing that the cars constantly send a signal inviting any fobs within
range to respond, and if one does reply with the correct code for the car,
it unlocks the doors and allows the engine to be started; it's designed to
work only over a few yards/metres, but the thieves' relays enable the range
to be extended.  People often drop their keys in a bowl or case just inside
the front door of their houses so that they can be grabbed as they leave.
(In the olden days, thieves used magnets on rods passed through the
letterbox to snaffle bunches of keys on keyrings, or would ring the doorbell
and have an accomplice discreetly take keys while the householder was
distracted.)  By the way, Vauxhall was the UK brand name for GM cars,
although it's recently been sold to a European automaker.)

A couple of thoughts on automation:

1.  What do we really want these soon-to-be-laid-off people to do?  Does it
make any sense to pay people to produce goods inefficiently, in the style of
Soviet factories making goods that will never be consumed, just so they have
a job?  The economist Milton Friedman supposedly asked why workmen were
using shovels instead of machinery to build a canal.  The answer came back:
&quot;We need to provide more jobs.&quot;  Friedman's response: &quot;Then why not give
them spoons instead of shovels.&quot;

To his credit, Friedman championed a version of universal basic income (UBI)
to allow for both economic efficiency and economic support for those
displaced.  I'm not sure that UBI provides much of an identity of self-worth
for these ex-workers, but it is at least a start in the right direction.

2.  Since the Great Recession starting in 2008-9, governments around the
First World have kept interest rates at negative or zero (&quot;ZIRP&quot;).  Who do
you think benefits directly from ZIRP?  The coal miner?  The minimum wage
employee?  Not so much.  When capital becomes cheaper than labor, it's a
*no-brainer* to invest in automation, and the Davos elites have &quot;backed up
the truck&quot; to gorge on zero-interest-rate money to invest in robotics and
AI, knowing that eventually ZIRP would end, and this gravy train would stop.
At that point, these investments would pay off as labor became more
expensive relative to robots and automation.

The truth is, most of the First World has a demographic problem, in that
their populations are *falling*, so countries like Japan and China are going
to become totally reliant upon robots just to support their ever-growing
percentage of retired workers.  So we're going to need robots and
automation, but we're also going to need mechanisms to provide support and
activities other than meaningless jobs to enable people to live full and
meaningful lives.

I was waiting for another to reply to this message from Risk 31.02 as I feel
my lowly station of systems engineer in a small team in an education setting
I shouldn't be preaching to the masses, there are many more worth voices
than my own.

That being said, I don't feel Linux is the solution that some seems to claim
it is.

As always, all views are my own and do not represent anyone other than
myself.

I disagree with the ideas and ideals that Linux is some bastion of security
while I will admit Linux does have the edge on Microsoft OS's I simply do
not believe that in itself this enough to necessarily say it should be used
over any operating system, Microsoft or otherwise. I also feel Linux has a
perceived higher level of security than it actually does along with a number
of userbase and technical climate realities that skews both hard and
anecdotal evidence in Linux's favor.

The first of these things is the Linux userbase. windows is the worlds most
popular desktop OS. This leads by default to a less technical userbase,
where Linux as a desktop OS is often used by the more technically adept.
The more technically adept and I.T. security savvy are less likely to fall
for certain types of attacks such as phishing and clicking on suspicious
links. Both the higher volume of users and the chances of encountering one
of these less savvy users means windows is the more profitable target when
engaging on attacks when the net is cast wide.

Despite its open source nature this doesn't make Linux impervious to
vulnerabilities. Last year Windows 10 had 28 {1} vulnerabilities given a CVE
rating of 9 or more. Debian (which I'm using and I could get the stats
easily) had 20 in 2018 {2}. While 9 is a significant number Debian received
a total of 938 CVE's in 2018 with windows 10 only receiving 254.  Some of
this can be chalked up to the open source model allowing vulnerabilities to
be more easily identified but the concept that Linux has fewer
vulnerabilities or doesn't ship with them is simply not true.

Furthermore the low use case of thing like anti malware products on Linux
means that there is currently a lack of research in this area. In December
2018 ESET discovered 21 &quot;new&quot; families of Linux based malware. The issue
being these malware families weren't new, some appeared to be over 4 years
old. Furthermore, ESET only discovered these families because they we're
being removed by a competing malware ESET were actually investigating.
When you ask a long-term Linux user when they last saw some Linux malware
the answer will likely be never, but with the lack of strong widely used
anti malware tools for Linux the real question would be how would you know?

If everyone was to take the advice and switch to Linux exclusively for both
home and work environment to outcome could result in worse security as
threat actors target the new environment, more malicious actors looking for
weaknesses and vulnerabilities and a lack of tools to provide a decent
defense in depth response.

While this may be a pie in the sky idea, I believe security principles
should be both hardware and software agnostic and this simple changing of an
OS doesn't necessarily make you more secure. Defense in depth, user training
and engagement, proper configuration, and a healthy dose of skepticism and
luck in equal measures. Is really the only way to provide a safe
environment, not specific tools, tech.

I can think of two reasons, both of which make an equal amount of sense.  a)
If 5G was perfect how would we sell them 6G? We have to make money too.  b)
Security is like global warming&#8212;if we can get by just by paying lip
service to the notion and not doing anything effective about it, that's the
easier and less expensive path.  Until we have a real Pearl Harbor on the
Internet, nobody that matters is going to care.  It's going to take an
incident that bankrupts a large high-profile company, paralyzes the
Internet, kills hundreds of people, or forces the recall of millions of
devices before what is optional becomes mandatory.

I once tried to read a shrink-wrap EULA (of commercial software) in its
entirety; it took almost an hour, and that's just the reading, I cannot
claim to have actually understood it&#8212;despite having more than the 14.5
years of education cited as required by the article, I have no formal legal
education.

That's irrelevant anyway, because under that EULA, by clicking &quot;I agree&quot; I
have put any future dispute I may have with the company under the
jurisdiction of courts in the State of New York; there aren't many lawyers
around here who know enough about NY law to file a case (not at any
reasonable price), so this clause essentially puts possible legal resolution
out of my reach.

IOW, this is not really an &quot;agreement&quot;, more like a CYA legal trick designed
to exempt the company from legal responsibility to possible damage
(accidental, and even intentional) their software might inflict upon their
customers.

In the age of instant ubiquitous global communication, there is no need to
manipulate reality in a professional level in order to make people believe
in misinformation.

See for example the anti-Vax case, where a pseudo scientific article
(rejected later) which connected one type of (disused) vaccine to a rare
type of autism&#8212;or rather, just the rumour of the article, since it seems
no one had actually read it anyway&#8212;had caused so many people to stop
vaccination completely, enough to cause new outbreaks of diseases thought to
be long gone.

Unfortunately, it seems too many people would just believe anything sent by
their friends, rather than bother one click to check facts.

Web Informant, March 5, 2019 [via Gabe Goldberg]

A new report describes the depth of criminality across online ticketing
websites. I guess I was somewhat naive before I read the report, &quot;How Bots
affect ticketing,&quot; from Distil Networks
&lt;<a href="https://resources.distilnetworks.com/all-blog-posts/how-bots-affect-ticketing">https://resources.distilnetworks.com/all-blog-posts/how-bots-affect-ticketing</a>
(Registration is required.) The vendor sells anti-bot security tools, so
some of what they describe is self-serving to promote their own
solutions. But the picture they present is chilling and somewhat depressing.

The ticketing sites are being hit from all sides: from dishonest ticket
brokers and hospitality agents who scrape details and scalp or spin the
tickets, to criminals who focus on fan account takeovers to conduct credit
card fraud with their ticket purchases. These scams are happening 24/7,
because the bots never sleep. And there are multiple sources of ready-made
bad bots that can be set loose on any ticketing platform.

You probably know what scalping is, but spinning was new to me.  Basically,
it involves a mechanism that appears to be an indecisive human who is
selecting tickets but holding them in their cart and not paying for
them. This puts the tickets in limbo, and takes them off the active
marketplace just long enough that the criminals can manipulate their supply
and prevent the actual people from buying them. That is what lies at the
heart of the criminal ticketing bot problem: the real folks are denied their
purchases, and sometimes all seats are snapped up within a few milliseconds
of when they are put on sale. In many cases, fans quickly abandon the legit
ticketing site and find a secondary market for their seats, which may be
where the criminals want them to go. This is because the seat prices are
marked up, with more profit going to the criminals. It also messes with the
ticketing site's pricing algorithms, because they don't have an accurate
picture of ticket supply.

This is new report from Distil and focusing just on the ticketing
vendors. In the past year, they have seen a rise in the sophistication of
the bot owners' methods. That is because like much with cybercrime, there is
an arms race between defenders and the criminals, with each upping their
game to get around the other. The report studied 180 different ticketing
sites for a period of 105 days last fall, analyzing more than 26 billion
requests.

Distil found that the average traffic across all 180 sites was close to 40%
consumed by bad bots. That's the average: many sites had far higher
percentages of bad bot traffic.

Botnets aren't only a problem with ticketing websites, of course. In an
article that I wrote recently for CSOonline
&lt;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3339377/how-polls-are-hacked-what-every-business-should-know.html?nsdr=true#tk.twt_cso">https://www.csoonline.com/article/3339377/how-polls-are-hacked-what-every-business-should-know.html?nsdr=true#tk.twt_cso</a>
I discuss how criminals have manipulated online surveys and polls.
(Registration also required.) Botnets are just one of many methods to fudge
the results, infect survey participants with malware, and manipulate public
opinion.

So what can a ticketing site operator do to fight back? The report has
several suggestions, including preventing outdated browser versions, using
better Captchas, blocking known hosting providers popular with criminals,
and looking carefully at sources of traffic for high bounce rates, a series
of failed logins and lower conversion rates, three tells that indicate
botnets.

Comments always welcome here. &lt;<a href="http://blog.strom.com/wp/?p=7061">http://blog.strom.com/wp/?p=7061</a>

According to a complaint by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Cure
Encapsulations, Inc. and its owner, Naftula Jacobowitz:
&lt;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/quality_encapsulations_complaint_2-26-19.pdf">https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/quality_encapsulations_complaint_2-26-19.pdf</a>&gt;

  * paid a Web site, amazonverifiedreviews.com to create and post Amazon
    reviews of their product &quot;Quality Encapsulations Garcinia Cambogia
    Extract with HCA&quot; capsules.

  * falsely claimed that the product is an appetite-suppressing,
    fat-blocking, weight-loss pill.

Jacobowitz allegedly told the site's operator that the product needed to
have an average rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars in order to have sales and to,
&quot;Please make my product ... stay a five star.&quot; The reviews were posted on
Amazon and were represented as truthful and written by actual purchasers,
when in reality they were fabricated. The FTC's complaint also alleges that
the defendants made false and unsubstantiated claims on their Amazon product
page, including through the purchased reviews, that their garcinia cambogia
product is a &quot;powerful appetite suppressant,&quot; &quot;Literally BLOCKS FAT From
Forming,&quot; causes significant weight loss, including as much as twenty
pounds, and causes rapid and substantial weight loss, including as much as
two or more pounds per week.

The proposed court order settling the FTC's complaint
&lt;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/quality_encapsulations_proposed_order_2-26-19.pdf">https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/quality_encapsulations_proposed_order_2-26-19.pdf</a>&gt;:

  * prohibits the defendants from making weight-loss,
    appetite-suppression, fat-blocking, or disease-treatment claims for
    any dietary supplement, food, or drug unless they have competent and
    reliable scientific evidence in the form of human clinical testing
    supporting the claims.
  * requires them to have competent and reliable scientific evidence to
    support any other claims about the health benefits or efficacy of
    such products.
  * prohibits them from making misrepresentations regarding
    endorsements, including that an endorsement is truthful or by an
    actual user.
  * requires the defendants to email notices to consumers who bought the
    capsules detailing the FTC's allegations regarding their efficacy
    claims.
  * requires the defendants to notify Amazon, Inc. that they purchased
    Amazon reviews of their Quality Encapsulations Garcinia Cambogia
    capsules and to identify to Amazon the purchased reviews.
  * imposes a judgment of $12.8 million, which will be suspended upon
    payment of $50,000 to the Commission and the payment of certain
    unpaid income tax obligations.

If the defendants are later found to have misrepresented their financial
condition to the FTC, the full amount of the judgment will immediately
become due. [FTC brings first case challenging fake paid reviews on an
independent retail website.

&quot;Coming up with a truly personalized diet would require crunching billions
of pieces of data about each person. In addition to analyzing the 40
trillion bacteria from about 1,000 species that reside in our guts, as the
project I participated in did, it would need to take into account all of the
aspects of that person's health, including lifestyle, family history,
medical conditions, immune system, anatomy, physiology, medications and

The risks, I think, are self-evident.

The potential to deliver `one shot cures' is one of the most attractive
aspects of gene therapy, genetically-engineered cell therapy and gene
editing. However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard
to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies, analyst Salveen Richter wrote
in the note to clients Tuesday.  &#8220;While this proposition carries tremendous
value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome
medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow.''

Revealed: Facebook's global lobbying against data privacy laws

Social network targeted legislators around the world, promising or
threatening to withhold investment

Carole Cadwalladr &amp; Duncan Campbell, *The Guardian*, modified 3 Mar 2019

Facebook has targeted politicians around the world--including the former UK
chancellor, George Osborne--promising investments and incentives while
seeking to pressure them into lobbying on Facebook's behalf against data
privacy legislation, an explosive new leak of internal Facebook documents
has revealed.

The documents, which have been seen by the Observer and Computer Weekly,
reveal a secretive global lobbying operation targeting hundreds of
legislators and regulators in an attempt to procure influence across the
world, including in the UK, US, Canada, India, Vietnam, Argentina, Brazil,
Malaysia and all 28 states of the EU.  The documents include details of how
Facebook:

* Lobbied politicians across Europe in a strategic operation to head off
  &quot;overly restrictive&quot; GDPR legislation.  They include extraordinary claims
  that the Irish prime minister said his country could exercise significant
  influence as president of the EU, promoting Facebook's interests even
  though technically it was supposed to remain neutral.

* Used chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg's feminist memoir Lean In to
  &quot;bond&quot; with female European commissioners it viewed as hostile.

* Threatened to withhold investment from countries unless they supported or
  passed Facebook-friendly laws.

The documents appear to emanate from a court case against Facebook by the
app developer Six4Three in California, and reveal that Sandberg considered
European data protection legislation a &quot;critical&quot; threat to the company.  A
memo written after the Davos economic summit in 2013 quotes Sandberg
describing the &quot;uphill battle&quot; the company faced in Europe on the &quot;data and
privacy front&quot; and its &quot;critical&quot; efforts to head off &quot;overly prescriptive
new laws&quot;.

Most revealingly, it includes details of the company's &quot;great relationship&quot;
with Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister at the time, one of a number of
people it describes as &quot;friends of Facebook&quot;.  Ireland plays a key role in
regulating technology companies in Europe because its data protection
commissioner acts for all 28 member states.  The memo has inflamed data
protection advocates, who have long complained about the company's &quot;cosy&quot;
relationship with the Irish government.

The memo notes Kenny's &quot;appreciation&quot; for Facebook's decision to locate its
headquarters in Dublin and points out that the new proposed data protection
legislation was a &quot;threat to jobs, innovation and economic growth in
Europe&quot;.  It then goes on to say that Ireland is poised to take on the
presidency of the EU and therefore has the &quot;opportunity to influence the
European Data Directive decisions&quot;.  It makes the extraordinary claim that
Kenny offered to use the &quot;significant influence&quot; of the EU presidency as a
means of influencing other EU member states &quot;even though technically Ireland
is supposed to remain neutral in this role&quot;.

It goes on: &quot;The prime minister committed to using their EU presidency to
achieve a positive outcome on the directive.&quot;  Kenny, who resigned from
office in 2017, did not respond to the Observer's request for comment.

John Naughton, a Cambridge academic and Observer writer who studies the
democratic implications of digital technology, said the leak was &quot;explosive&quot;
in the way it revealed the &quot;vassalage&quot; of the Irish state to the big tech
companies.  Ireland had welcomed the companies, he noted, but became &quot;caught
between a rock and a hard place&quot;.  &quot;Its leading politicians apparently saw
themselves as covert lobbyists for a data monster.&quot;

A spokesperson for Facebook said the documents were still under seal
in a Californian court and it could not respond to them in any detail:
&quot;Like the other documents that were cherry-picked and released in
violation of a court order last year, these by design tell one side of
a story and omit important context.&quot;

The 2013 memo, written by Marne Levine, who is now a Facebook senior
executive, was cc-ed to Elliot Schrage, Facebook's then head of policy and
global communications, the role now occupied by Nick Clegg.  As well as
Kenny, dozens of other politicians, US senators and European commissioners
are mentioned by name, including then Indian president Pranab Mukherjee,
Michel Barnier, now the EU's Brexit negotiator, and Osborne.

The then chancellor used the meeting with Sandberg to ask Facebook to invest
in the government's Tech City venture, the memo claims, and Sandberg said
she would &quot;review&quot; any proposal.  In exchange, she asked him to become &quot;even
more active and vocal in the European Data Directive debate and really help
shape the proposals&quot;.  The memo claims Osborne asked for a detailed briefing
and said he would &quot;figure out how to get more involved&quot;.  He offered to host
a launch for Sandberg's book in Downing Street, an event that went ahead in
spring 2013.

Osborne told the Observer: &quot;I don't think it's a surprise that the UK
chancellor would meet the chief operating officer of one of the world's
largest companies ... Facebook and other US tech firms, in private, as in
public, raised concerns about the proposed European Data Directive.  To your
specific inquiry, I didn't follow up on those concerns, or lobby the EU,
because I didn't agree with them.&quot;

He noted it was &quot;not a secret&quot; that he had helped launch Sandberg's book at
11 Downing Street and added: &quot;The book's message about female empowerment
was widely praised, not least in the Guardian and the Observer.&quot;

In fact, the memo reveals that Sandberg's feminist memoir was perceived as a
lobbying tool by the Facebook team and a means of winning support from
female legislators for Facebook's wider agenda.

In a particularly revealing account of a meeting with Viviane Reding, the
influential European commissioner for justice, fundamental rights and
citizenship, the memo notes her key role as &quot;the architect of the European
Data Directive&quot; and describes the company's &quot;difficult&quot; relationship with
her owing to her being, it claims, &quot;not a fan&quot; of American companies.

&quot;She attended Sheryl's Lean In dinner and we met with her right afterward,&quot;
the memo says, but notes that she felt it was a &quot;very 'American'
discussion&quot;, a comment the team regarded as a setback since &quot;getting more
women into C-level jobs and on boards was supposed to be how they bonded,
and it backfired a bit&quot;.

The Davos meetings are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of Facebook's
global efforts to win influence.  The documents reveals how in Canada and
Malaysia it used the promise of siting a new data centre with the prospect
of job creation to win legislative guarantees.  When the Canadians hesitated
over granting the concession Facebook wanted, the memo notes: &quot;Sheryl took a
firm approach and outlined that a decision on the data center was imminent.
She emphasized that if we could not get comfort from the Canadian government
on the jurisdiction issue, we had other options.&quot;  The minister supplied the
agreement Facebook required by the end of the day, it notes.

It's bad enough when financial institutions don't practice what they preach,
but it only compounds the confusion when they promise one thing and do the
opposite. For example, Merrill Lynch recently posted this online alert:
&#8220;Recently, some Merrill Lynch clients have reported receiving emails that
appear to be from Merrill Lynch but which have, in fact, been sent by
imposters.  ... How can you tell the difference?  Fraudulent emails
typically include website links, and/or request you to provide personal
information. Merrill Lynch has not and will not initiate a request for
sensitive information via email.''

But when we reviewed a legitimate email sent by Merrill Edge, it did contain
website links and invitations to click to `view statements'.  When the link
is clicked, it takes you to an account login page where Merrill requests
sensitive information, in the form of your user ID and password.

Thus, Merrill's own legitimate email is similar to the emails it warns could
be bogus.

Richi Jennings, Security Boulevard, 4 Mar 2019

Facebook has been caught red-handed again, so say privacy wonks. They accuse
Zuckerberg's crew of misusing phone numbers given to it for use in
two-factor authentication.

Said wonks say Facebook is sharing the data with Instagram and WhatsApp to
secretly link your profiles together. And that it lets miscreants look you
up by your phone number, subjecting your identity to stalking, social
engineering and other malicious awfulness. Facebook is also accused of
violating GDPR, for using the numbers without consent.

The risk? Facebook.

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/technology/uber-self-driving-car-arizona.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/technology/uber-self-driving-car-arizona.html</a>

&quot;Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they had not found evidence to charge
Uber with a crime in connection with an accident in which one of its
autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe a year ago.

&quot;On March 18, 2018, a Volvo sport utility vehicle, one of several
self-driving vehicles that Uber was testing, was traveling about 40 miles
per hour when it hit Elaine Herzberg, 49, as she was walking her bicycle
across the street at night, the authorities said.  While the car was in
autonomous mode, a safety driver was sitting in the driver's seat.  The
Yavapai County Attorney's Office, which reviewed the case, said in a letter
dated Monday that there was 'no basis for criminal liability for the Uber
corporation.'  But it added that investigators should look into what the
safety driver 'would or should have seen that night given the vehicle's
speed, lighting conditions, and other relevant factors.'&quot;

A favorable prosecution determination: blame the carbon component, not the
silicon. A jury trial on behalf of Ms. Herzberg's estate, if victorious,
might terminate the entire AV technology industry.

Outdoor Tech makes the Chips 2.0 speakers for your audio equipped ski
helmet.  It give you the ability to have conversations with your other
friends on the ski slope via a Bluetooth connection to your smartphone, and
thence over the Internet.
<a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/03/06/ski-headphones-flaw-unlocks-mountain-of-user-data/">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/03/06/ski-headphones-flaw-unlocks-mountain-of-user-data/</a>

First problem: all the conversations go through Outdoor Tech's servers.

Second problem: in order to set up conversations with your friends, you have
to set up a group.  You have to search for your friends names.  While
searching, it turns out you can, with very little effort, find absolutely
anyone who has registered the speakers.  And their email addresses.  And
their phone numbers.

You can also find out where they are.

And reset their passwords.

I'm going to recommend this for all my skiing friends who don't think
security is important ...

Today someone noted that PDF signatures are broken:

<a href="https://www.pdf-insecurity.org/index.html">https://www.pdf-insecurity.org/index.html</a>

But I don't trust PDF signatures in any case.  I am pretty sure that almost
nobody knows how to use them.  (I mean, really.  How many security mavens
who actually understand cryptography and PKI are there in comparison to the
total number of people using tech they don't understand for almost all of
their business functions?)

For example: A certain entity which shall not be named (but whom we all
know) has asked me to sign an NDA for a process which I can't tell you about
because it's probably covered by the NDA.  I don't have a PDF document
creation program.  So I signed the signature page (of the five page NDA),
scanned that page, and sent it back.

(Whilst looking for and printing the NDA PDF I noticed that it had &quot;active&quot;
fields for name, address, etc.  When I went to fill in the date, my reader
[Foxit] offered to &quot;sign&quot; the document.  I don't know how, since I'm not
particularly aware of any certificates on my machine.)

I got a message back from an admin saying that the legal team says a JPEG
isn't good enough, and could I send in a PDF.

No, I didn't go back and get Foxit to sign it.  I opened a document in
LibreOffice, inserted the JPEG, and &quot;printed&quot; it as a PDF.  That seems to
have been acceptable.

(Although now they want a PDF of the whole five pages ...)

Never attribute to technical faults that which can be can be adequately
explained away by ignorance or pure, blind stupidity ...

In 2009, Google was hacked by the Chinese military.  Now Chronicle, a
security start-up owned by Google parent company Alphabet, plans to help
other companies learn from that experience.  The company's new Backstory
product will make Alphabet's storage, indexing, and search capabilities
available to other companies so they can trace the origins of a malicious
attack.  Chronicle is one of dozens of companies currently promising big
data threat intelligence and storage.  While many customers of other firms
can't afford to pay to search through huge amounts of information, Chronicle
says it will charge customer companies by their number of employees.

Yet again, Facebook is caught using data for other purposes than indicated
at the time of collection (to phrase it in EU privacy law terms).  Not that
this ought to come as a surprise by now, it appears pretty much their modus
operandi.

This week's installment:

&quot;Another week, another Facebook privacy storm.  This time, the Silicon
Valley giant has been caught red-handed using people's cellphone numbers,
provided exclusively for two-factor authentication, for targeted advertising
and search&#8212;after it previously insinuated it wouldn't do that.
Folks handing over their mobile numbers to protect their accounts from
takeovers and hijackings thought the contact detail would be used for just
that: security. Instead, Facebook is using the numbers to link netizens to
other people, and target them with online ads.&quot;

&gt; Precisely because Congresspersons utilize robocalls *themselves* for their
&gt; own re-election campaigns.

Yes, they exempt themselves but this is a somewhat self limiting issue due
to campaign schedules.  FWIW, in my experience if you tell a candidate to
stop calling, they usually do.

&gt; Who else loves robocalls?  Phone companies themselves.  Robocalls run up
&gt; lucrative charges on accounts that would otherwise have *zero* traffic and
&gt; minimum account charges.

This is simply false.  Inter-company accounting these days is all bill and
keep, so nobody gets paid for robocalls.  The problem is that the SS#7
signaling system was designed for a world in which there was a small number
of telcos and they all knew each other so there wasn't any internal
security, sort of like the early Internet.  Through the magic of VoIP now
anyone can dump a call into the network.

The point of the IETF's STIR and SHAKEN is to add a cryptographic signature
of the party injecting the call.  (The telco or VoIP provider, not the
individual caller.)  People I know at at large telcos say they're planning
to do what is essentially spam filtering, lose dubious looking calls coming
from parties with poor reputations.

&gt; Who else loves robocalls?  NSA/intelligence agencies. ...

Sorry, my tin foil hat is at the cleaners this week.

What happened to IBM had happened to most big US companies in the 2000's.
Because of reduced regulations, corporations can make more money out of
their shares value than out of production. This means that IBM is no longer
a computer company, Ford is no longer a car company, etc.&#8212;they are all
stock brokerage companies, using their manufacturing part as en excuse.

Companies are no longer committed to their product, even to their customers,
and certainly not committed to their workers. (In another Big Company I'd
worked at, even the wording of the CEO's New Year message had changed from
&#8220;keep up the good work, generating value for our customers'' to &#8220;making
value for our shareholders'').

Consequently, anything which does not affect the share value, preferably
within the next quarter, is being scaled down. Middle managers know that,
but are helpless to do anything, they just grind their teeth and cut
corners; if the increase in raw profits (or even the increase of the
increase) stops rising for more than one quarter, shareholders will just
take their money elsewhere, and they'd all be jobless overnight. (Upper
management have their golden parachutes, of course).

One effect is that IBM has been growing in the past decades by acquiring
smaller companies which so far had escaped this fate, and can still do some
serious R&amp;D. These companies still exist intact as independent business
units within IBM. So IBM is no longer a big company, it's becoming a
conglomerate of smaller ones.  (Some of the suggested future development
ideas mentioned at the end of the ad, are actually projects of companies
acquired by IBM).

*A three-year UN-backed study from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy
Platform On Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services has grim implications for
the future of humanity.*

EXCERPT:

Nature is in freefall and the planet's support systems are so stretched
that we face widespread species extinctions and mass human migration unless
urgent action is taken. That's the warning hundreds of scientists are
preparing to give, and it's stark.

The last year has seen a slew of brutal and terrifying warnings about the
threat climate change poses to life. Far less talked about but just as
dangerous, if not more so, is the rapid decline of the natural world. The
felling of forests, the over-exploitation of seas and soils, and the
pollution of air and water are together driving the living world to the
brink, according to a huge three-year, U.N.-backed landmark study to be
published in May.

The study from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform On
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), expected to run to over 8,000
pages, is being compiled by more than 500 experts in 50 countries. It is
the greatest attempt yet to assess the state of life on Earth and will show
how tens of thousands of species are at high risk of extinction, how
countries are using nature at a rate that far exceeds its ability to renew
itself, and how nature's ability to contribute food and fresh water to a
growing human population is being compromised in every region on earth.

Nature underpins all economies with the `free' services it provides in the
form of clean water, air and the pollination of all major human food crops
by bees and insects. In the Americas, this is said to total more than $24
trillion a year. The pollination of crops globally by bees and other animals
alone is worth up to $577 billion.

The final report will be handed to world leaders not just to help
politicians, businesses and the public become more aware of the trends
shaping life on Earth, but also to show them how to better protect nature.

&#8220;High-level political attention on the environment has been focused largely
on climate change because energy policy is central to economic growth. But
biodiversity is just as important for the future of earth as climate
change,'' said Sir Robert Watson, overall chair of the study, in a telephone
interview from Washington, D.C.

&#8220;We are at a crossroads. The historic and current degradation and
destruction of nature undermine human well-being for current and countless
future generations,'' added the British-born atmospheric scientist who has
led programs at NASA and was a science adviser in the Clinton
administration. &#8220;Land degradation, biodiversity loss and climate change are
three different faces of the same central challenge: the increasingly
dangerous impact of our choices on the health of our natural environment.''

Around the world, land is being deforested, cleared and destroyed with
catastrophic implications for wildlife and people. Forests are being felled
across Malaysia, Indonesia and West Africa to give the world the palm oil we
need for snacks and cosmetics. Huge swaths of Brazilian rainforest are being
cleared to make way for soy plantations and cattle farms, and to feed the
timber industry, a situation likely to accelerate under new leader Jair
Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist.

Industrial farming is to blame for much of the loss of nature, said Mark
Rounsevell, professor of land use change at the Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology in Germany, who co-chaired the European section of the IPBES
study. &#8220;The food system is the root of the problem. The cost of ecological
degradation is not considered in the price we pay for food, yet we are still
subsidizing fisheries and agriculture.''

This destruction wrought by farming threatens the foundations of our food
system. A February report from the U.N. warned that the loss of soil,
plants, trees and pollinators such as birds, bats and bees undermines the
world's ability to produce food.

An obsession with economic growth as well as spiraling human populations is
also driving this destruction, particularly in the Americas where GDP is
expected to nearly double by 2050 and the population is expected to increase
20 percent to 1.2 billion over the same period. [...]

Comprehensive avionics software qualification of operational flight plans --
that stuff blown into PROMs or CPLDs&#8212;requires exceptional organizational
maturity to achieve.

One life-cycle maturity indicator resides in collaterals: test plans, test
results, qualification wall-clock duration, and top-10 defect escapes. These
data points can indicate production defect escape suppression effectiveness.

Few, if any, businesses willingly publish this content. Correlate it across
industrial competition and against mitre.org CVEs to enable and guide
consumer purchase decisions.  Open source &quot;eyes&quot; help to identify code
defects before publication.  Shouldn't commercial-grade mission critical
software stacks rely on an equivalent inspection mechanism to suppress
production defect escape potential? IP protection is important, but so are
the life-critical nature of the product, brand resilience, and the end-user.

In Boeing's case, there appears to be a maturity gap. Repair deployment
delay is one, and deficient transition/training of new capabilities is
another, especially in light the emphasis to &quot;reduce deployment and airline
operational costs.&quot;

Risk: Change management maturity deficiency and opaque industrial operations
conceal defective product.

The robot, aware of its impending demise, alerted owners with a sad farewell

Companies are leaking sensitive files via Box accounts
Leaks discovered at Apple, the Discovery Channel, Herbalife,
Schneider Electric, and even Box itself.

<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/companies-are-leaking-sensitive-files-via-box-accounts/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/companies-are-leaking-sensitive-files-via-box-accounts/</a>

Companies that use Box.com as a cloud-based file hosting and sharing system
might be accidentally exposing internal files, sensitive documents, or
proprietary technology.

The problem lies with Box.com account owners who don't set a default access
level of &quot;People in your company&quot; for file/folder sharing links, leaving all
newly created links accessible to the public.

  [What about having a warning message such as 'Warning: The default access
  has not been set to &quot;People in your company&quot;.  This is dangerous as
  outsiders could access information that should remain private.?  Do you
  wish to change this?'  [Yes] [Why Not?]]

If the organization also allows users to customize the link with vanity URLs
instead of using random characters, then the links of these files can be
guessed using dictionary attacks.

  [Risk: Calling it a &quot;vanity&quot; URL.  Being able to specify a URL is useful
  for mnemonic reasons.  Is someone going to think the reason for specifying
  the name is vanity?]

This is what Adversis did last year. The company says it scanned Box.com for
accounts belonging to large companies and attempted to guess vanity URLs of
files or folders that employees shared in the past.

Its efforts weren't in vain. In a report published today, Adversis said it
found a trove of highly sensitive data such as:
  [the usual sort of stuff: were you really expecting something else?]

Most of these file leaks have been fixed, and Box notified all customers
last September of the dangers of using incorrect access permissions for
Box.com share links.

&quot;We provide admins tools to run various reports on open links across their
enterprise, as well as to disable open and custom URLs for their
enterprise,&quot; a Box spokesperson told us via email. &quot;Admins can also ensure
that 'People in the Company' is the default setting for all shared links to
limit the potential for a user to set a [file] as public inadvertently.&quot;

  [What about making such a scan being the default action?]

&quot;Among the positions with more than a 90 per cent chance of becoming

Security researchers in the U.K. have found vulnerabilities in three popular
smart car alarm apps, making vehicles susceptible to theft or hijacking. The
apps--from the companies Clifford, Viper, and Pandora--control alarms in 3
million vehicles. For example, Pandora Alarms, which had hyped its system as
&quot;unhackable,&quot; was found to permit users to reset passwords for any account,
enabling hackers to activate car alarms, unlock vehicle doors, and start
engines. The researchers also determined Clifford's app had a bug that
allowed them to use a legitimate account to access other users' profiles,
then alter the passwords for those accounts and take control. Viper and
Clifford parent firm Directed has corrected the bug, while Pandora also said
it has upgraded security. Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey said it
was &quot;disappointing&quot; that relatively simple vulnerabilities had been
introduced by security companies.

Rob Slade 
&lt;rmslade@shaw.ca&gt;
</address>
<i>Sun, 17 Mar 2019 10:45:56 -0800</i><pre>
The general media has (temporarily) discovered hashing.
<a href="https://lite.cnn.io/en/article/h_f53c07f70ccd1b7fd21d53163da2c280">https://lite.cnn.io/en/article/h_f53c07f70ccd1b7fd21d53163da2c280</a>

I predict a short run of calls for social media platforms to use it to
prevent the spread of hate videos, violent videos, revenge pr0n, etc, etc,
etc.

I've seen hashing in use for some time.  Fifteen years ago it was very
popular as the increase in the number of viruses exploded.  Not so long ago
Facebook tried using it in an odd, rather futile, and foolish attempt to
prevent revenge pr0n.  It's been used to prevent the theft of music and
video as intellectual property for some time.

It works, a bit, but not terribly well.

The idea is to detect something you don't want spread, and then take a hash
of it.  You can then search, relatively quickly, and compare that hash value
against the hash values of either existing files, or newly uploaded files
(depending upon your application).

I said &quot;relatively&quot; quickly.  One of the people quoted in that article said
&quot;It's exceedingly fast.&quot;  It's exceedingly fast compared to more detailed
forms of analysis.  But when around 10 *hours* of video are uploaded to
YouTube alone every *second* (anybody have current statistics?) ... well,
hashing does take some time, and little bits add up.  And then there is the
time to compare every hash against every other hash ...

And hashing works only if nothing has been changed.  After all, hash values
are used, sometimes in digital signatures or certificates, to ensure that
something hasn't changed.  Again, someone in the article referred to
&quot;'robust' hashing&#8212;a method that should be able to detect variations on
re-uploads.&quot;  That's an interesting use of the word &quot;robust.&quot;  I'd think
most people in the crypto field would think of a &quot;robust&quot; hash as one that
would detect any changes, not one that would allow some changes and still
match.  But, quite aside from the use of the word &quot;robust,&quot; making a hash
that will accept some changes and still detect &quot;similar&quot; is a non-trivial
task.  And such a hash function would likely take even more time to run.

It's easy to use hashes to catch direct and identical copies.  But videos
can be modified in all kinds of ways.  They can be edited for length, cut
into collections, processed to add comments, or even just drop a few packets
during streaming.  Any or all of these events could mean that a hash value
will not match.

No, I don't think hashing will be the silver bullet people are looking for ...

The Trump administration's effort to ban Huawei from overseas wireless
networks has suffered from questions over whether the Chinese telecom

My health insurance provider is the largest provider in my state.  They have
an iPhone app that can provide alerts for new claims, explanations of
benefits, and other related data.

About 5 minutes ago I got a notification with wording something like this:

  &#8220;The security questions for Carmello have been updated.''

I'm not Carmello; I don't know anyone by that name.

Perhaps coincidentally (though probably not), attempts to log into the app
now fail.  When I just now tried to log into the website, I got this vague
error:

  &#8220;Error - We're sorry, login isn't available at this time. Please log in
  again later.''

Will I soon be reading about a big data breach at this insurer?  I won't be
surprised.

&gt; ... I'm aware of California and Florida, for example.  At least one
&gt; Canadian province (British Columbia) is considering doing the same.

Massachusetts, too.

For some reason, states can opt out of DST, but they can't opt for
year-round DST, so if FL or MA does year round DST, they will have to do it
by moving to the AST time zone with no DST.

If the clocks don't already handle AST, they're not really fit for purpose,
since Puerto Rico and the USVI have been on AST for a century.

Boeing is issuing a software upgrade for the troubled 737 MAX 8 aircraft in
the coming weeks.  (The announcement is fairly far down this article.)
<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/boeing-upgrade-software-737-max-8-1.5052471">https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/boeing-upgrade-software-737-max-8-1.5052471</a>

Presumably this will address some issues with the MCAS flight software.

Hopefully the upgrade won't be online, with aircraft rebooting in mid-flight
...

(I'm waiting for 737 MAX 8 ver. 3.0 ...)

Excerpt: I woke up this morning to discover, yet again, that I was one of a
stupidly large number of people whose personal data had been leaked in the
latest mega breach. Troy Hunt's 'have i been pwned?'  service informed me
that 763,117,241 people have had their records leaked by Verifications IO:
including verified emails, phone numbers, addresses, dates of birth,
Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram account details, credit scoring and even
mortgage data such as amount owing and interest rates being charged. Which
wasn't the best news to receive first thing on a Sunday morning. But then
things got even worse, a lot worse. SC Media UK reports that Andrew Martin,
CEO &amp; founder of cybersecurity company DynaRisk, has revealed the true
number of leaked records is much higher. How much higher?  How does a total
of 2,069,145,043 unencrypted records grab you?

&lt;<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a>&gt;
&lt;<a href="https://www.scmagazineuk.com/2-billion-records-leaked-breach-triple-size-earlier-reports/article/1578429">https://www.scmagazineuk.com/2-billion-records-leaked-breach-triple-size-earlier-reports/article/1578429</a>&gt;

*So, what actually happened?*

According to Bleeping Computer
&lt;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/insecure-database-leads-to-over-800-million-records-data-breach/">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/insecure-database-leads-to-over-800-million-records-data-breach/</a>&gt;
an unprotected MongoDB database was discovered by security researcher Bob
Diachenko. Having cross-referenced the data, sitting there in plain text,
with the have i been pwned site, Diachenko was able to conclude this was
fresh to the market new information and not just a dump of previously
breached data as has been seen with the recent Collection 1 leak.
&lt;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/02/01/2-2-billion-accounts-found-in-biggest-ever-data-dump-how-to-check-if-youre-a-victim/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/02/01/2-2-billion-accounts-found-in-biggest-ever-data-dump-how-to-check-if-youre-a-victim/</a>&gt;
After doing some more investigative work, Diachenko was able to track the
database back to the Verifications IO enterprise email validation service.
This company validates bulk email lists for companies wanting to remove
inactive addresses from newsletter mailouts. Diachenko reported, working
alongside researcher Vinny Troia, that a total of 808,539,939 records had
been leaked. The 'mailEmailDatabase' contained three sections: Emailrecords,
emailWithPhone and businessLeads containing that data.  However, DynaRisk
CEO, Andrew Martin, also analyzed the data and came to the conclusion that
on the one server exposed to the web there were actually four databases not
just the one. He told The Register
&lt;<a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/08/verificationio_database_hole/">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/08/verificationio_database_hole/</a>&gt;
&quot;Our analysis was conducted over all four databases and extracted over two
billion email addresses. The additional three databases were hosted on the
same server, which is no longer accessible.&quot;

*What data was leaked?*

The security researcher who made the discovery, Bob Diachenko
&lt;<a href="https://securitydiscovery.com/800-million-emails-leaked-online-by-email-verification-service/">https://securitydiscovery.com/800-million-emails-leaked-online-by-email-verification-service/</a>&gt;
says that &quot;although not all records contained the detailed profile
information about the email owner, a large amount of records were very
detailed.&quot; That detail included commonplace breach data such as email
addresses and phone numbers, but went far beyond the basics as well.
Information such as dates of birth, mortgages amounts and interest rates
and social media accounts related to the emails in question. But it doesn't
stop there, you can also throw in basic credit scoring data, company names
and revenue figures as well.

*Should you be worried?*

Yes, of course you should. This was, after all, a massive leak of the kind
of personal information that would be a goldmine for the phishers and
spammers of this world. However, that concern can be diluted by a number of
factors. Not least there's the small matter that nobody has found any
compelling evidence that the data has actually been used for any criminal
purpose as of yet. Although the databases were accessible for some time, as
soon as the problem was disclosed to Verifications IO the service was taken
offline and remains so. Which means that bad guys alerted by this news
won't be able to exploit it. What's just as important as what was in the
breach is what wasn't. So, there were no social security numbers, no credit
card numbers, no passwords. And, importantly, this was a leak not a hack:
white hat researchers found the data was accessible rather than black hats
looking to exploit it.

*Can you mitigate your risk?...*  [...]

The rogue code can disable safety systems designed to prevent catastrophic
industrial accidents. It was discovered in the Middle East, but the hackers
behind it are now targeting companies in North America and other parts of
the world, too.  ...

Over the past decade or so, companies have been adding Internet connectivity
and sensors to all kinds of industrial equipment. The data captured is being
used for everything from predictive maintenance=E2=80=94which means using
machine-learning models to better anticipate when equipment needs
servicing=E2=80=94to fine-tuning production processes. There=E2=80=99s also
been a big push to control processes remotely through things like
smartphones and tablets.

All this can make businesses much more efficient and productive, which
explains why they are expected to spend around $42 billion this year on
industrial Internet gear such as smart sensors and automated control
systems, according to the ARC Group, which tracks the market. But the risks
are also clear: the more connected equipment there is, the more targets
hackers have to aim at.  ...

The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) has an article this
morning describing 3 million simulated phishing emails sent to staff at 6
US healthcare systems. 14% resulted in a click. One finding was that the
odds of clicking dropped to about 5% after 10 fake phishing campaigns. They
did not test how many people would enter login credentials, but clearly
some would, having trusted the link in the first place.
<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2727270">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2727270</a>

&quot;If the simulated email is clicked, it is used as a real-time opportunity
to provide short phishing education to the employee.&quot; This missed the
chance to teach about much bigger cyber weaknesses in healthcare.
Displaying rotating messages about the multitude of cyber risks would help
administrators and staff think about and reduce risks more widely.

These efforts do not protect an organization from phishing. At a 5% click
rate, emails to 24 recipients give a 70% chance that someone will click.
There is no reliable way to tell phishing emails from legitimate emails.
When people think an email looks suspicious, and send it for checking, 90%
are &quot;legitimate,&quot; which means most people cannot tell them apart. Sending them
for checking simply prevents access to the 90% which are legitimate, since
checkers rarely send them back. Advice never to click an email link is
impractical too, since the world lives by such links.
<a href="https://www.checkbook.org/washington-area/phishing-scams-is-your-financial-institution-helping-cyberthieves/">https://www.checkbook.org/washington-area/phishing-scams-is-your-financial-institution-helping-cyberthieves/</a>
<a href="https://cofense.com/whitepaper/state-of-phishing-defense-2018/">https://cofense.com/whitepaper/state-of-phishing-defense-2018/</a>

Even JAMA and Checkbook send email links to their articles, these links ask
for a login, and it can be hard to find the articles except by clicking.
One of the JAMA authors used to work for a contractor which sent 135
million simulated phishing emails. They got similar click rates in every
industry, so systems need to protect themselves with compartmentalization,
data transfer only to other hardware-identified health systems, etc.
<a href="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PhishMe_EnterprisePhishingSusceptibilityReport_2015_Final.pdf">https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PhishMe_EnterprisePhishingSusceptibilityReport_2015_Final.pdf</a>

The education offered upon a click is a good time to raise cyber security
awareness, but it can't stop people clicking on emails. Emails to IT
administrators can be filtered to remove all links, or this could apply
after the first time (third time?) they click on a simulated phish.

Peter Holley, *The Washington Post*, 7 Mar 2019, via ACM TechNews 8 Mar 2019

New Zealand farmers are using drones to herd livestock, with some capable of
emitting barks like dogs. One drone, the DJI Mavic Enterprise, can record
sounds and play them over a loudspeaker, allowing the machine to mimic its
canine counterparts. Shepherd Corey Lambeth said cows are less resistant to
drones than to actual dogs, which means the machines move livestock faster,
with less stress. The drones also let farmers monitor their land remotely,
tracking water and feed levels, and checking on livestock health without
upsetting the animals. Said farmer Jason Rentoul, &quot;Being a hilly farm where
a lot of stuff is done on foot, the drones really saved a lot of
man-hours. The drone does the higher bits that you can't see [from the
ground], and you would [otherwise] have to walk half an hour to go and have
a look and then go, 'Oh, there was no sheep there.'&quot;

On paper, the senate bill establishes federal IoT baseline standards for
certain &quot;covered devices.&quot; These devices consist of: &quot;(a) capable of
connecting to and is in regular connection with the Internet; has computer
processing capabilities that can collect, send, or receive data; and is not
a general-purpose computing device, including personal computing systems,
smart mobile communications devices, programmable logic controls, and
mainframe computing systems.&quot;

Generally, wireless medical devices (pacemakers, etc.), environmental
controllers (NeST), Zigbee, etc. Should help reduce botnet co-opting via
common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs).

Risk: Organizational maturity that may prevent implementation compliance and
operational vigilance after policy enacted into law.

<i>Sat, 9 Mar 2019 19:26:28 +0200</i><pre>
I hold a Revolut Business account.  A counter-party of mine holds a Revolut
Personal account.  Users in the Revolut Personal system are uniquely
identified by their phone number.

Some months ago I added this counter-party in my Revolut Business account
and about two weeks ago made a (small - no need to shed tears) transfer to
them.

The transfer did not arrive.  We then began a game of customer support
ping-ping.  Revolut Business assured me the transfer had succeeded, and
referred me to Revolut Personal support.  Revolut Personal assured my
counter-party the transfer was unknown to them, and referred them to Revolut
Business support.  In the end, my counter-party and I realised for ourselves
what had happened : my counter-party had since I created their counter-party
entry changed their phone number&#8212;my information for them still used their
old number.

(The Revolut Business web-site does not display the phone number of a
counter-party *anywhere*.  In fact, you can retrieve the phone number of a
counter-party only by contacting customer support.)

Revolut Business support assert that if a transfer is made to a non-existent
phone number, the transfer will fail.

This is not correct (but this is expected - first line customer support for
any larger company always and invariably is to truth what whiskey is to
alcoholism).

The transfer was made, but went and silently into limbo.

When we had noticed this has happened, and then later had worked out what
had happened, and informed Revolut Personal customer support, providing the
old number, they retrieved the funds and moved them to the counter-party's
account.  (I'm not sure how they validated their claim to the old number.)

This begs the question as to what happens if the phone number has in the
meantime been reused by the telco and another person has opened a Revolut
account with that number and, for good measure, while we're asking
questions, possibly spent those funds.  (I would expect the customer to be
held completely and fully responsible, for using the wrong phone number.)

In the existing banking system, the unique ID for an account is controlled
by the bank itself.  They do not re-use IDs, or only knowingly re-use IDs.

In the Revolut system, the unique ID for the account is controlled by the
telco, who are oblivious to the existence of Revolut and with a complete
lack of consideration for FinTech startups, re-use IDs.

(Please bear strongly in mind it is impossible for me to verify or even
discuss any of this information with Revolut, so it could be there is a
flaw, or many, in my understanding.  What I have written is what is true to
the best of my knowledge.)

In general, phone numbers as unique IDs are now not uncommon.  This issue of
a third party controlling ID would seem then on the face of it to extend
potentially to all such systems, and when there are a range of systems
facing the same challenge, there exists a range of success in the response
to that challenge.

(Actually, using a phone number as an ID is I think extremely unwise always,
since it enables your identity to be linked up to third party information.
Privacy is best served with a web-based burner email address service, such
as mailinator, accessed via Tor.  However, burner mobile phones can be found
on Amazon for 10 USD.  Remember the phone has a unique ID, and the SIM also,
so you need to change both the phone and the SIM; never re-use a burner
phone with multiple SIMs.  Also remember when you do use it, don't use it at
home - you will be geolocated by the telco, and that will also give you
away.  Go somewhere you've never been before, and never go there again.
Actually of course, none of this I mean seriously, rather, I write it to
show how much specialist knowledge, and effort, is required to be
anonymous.)

As a parent, you might walk past your child's room and see her happily
typing away on a Google Docs page.  &#8220;Lovely!'', you think.  &#8220;She's
probably working on her science report or finishing up her essay on the rise
of RBG.''

Or, she could be in a secret chat room.

In today's edition of Let's Try to Stay One Step Ahead of Our Kids on the
Internet (spoiler: we can't!), we're offering this heads-up: Some are using
Google Docs, the seemingly wholesome web-based word processor, to skirt
their parents' tech rules. It's impressive, really. All they need to do is
open up a document, invite their friends to become collaborators, and boom
-- they have a private space to chat, draw, share links, upload photos and
post memes. Google Docs is hardly a program parents think to block (in fact,
on tech message boards, I've seen several parents asking how to ban
everything except for the software) and many kids already have accounts for
school. After the chat session, they can simply delete the document and
empty their Trash folder without leaving any record.

&quot;A doctor in California told a patient he was going to die using a robot
with a video-link screen.

&quot;Ernest Quintana, 78, was at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Fremont
when a doctor - appearing on the robot's screen - informed him that he would
die within a few days.

&quot;A family friend wrote on social media that it was 'not the way to show
value and compassion to a patient'.

&quot;The hospital says it 'regrets falling short' of the family's expectations.

&quot;Mr Quintana died the next day.&quot;

&quot;Michelle Gaskill-Hames, senior vice-president of Kaiser Permanente Greater
Southern Alameda County, told the Associated Press that its policy was to
have a nurse or doctor in the room when remote consultations took place.&quot;

Risk: Telemedicine's convenience eliminates compassion from healthcare
delivery, especially for acute patient illness.

Some U.S. states are mulling proposals to adopt Daylight Saving Time year
round&#8212;I'm aware of California and Florida, for example.  At least one
Canadian province (British Columbia) is considering doing the same.

It occurs to me that if states in the Eastern time zone (UTC-5; UTC-4 in
summer) adopt year-round DST, this will break WWVB-based &quot;atomic clocks&quot; in
those states during the winter (November through early March).

WWVB-based clocks currently on the market in the US offer four time zones
(Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern), plus an option either to move
between standard and daylight time per the US-wide rules or to stay
permanently on standard time.  If California goes to year-round DST, &quot;atomic
clock&quot; owners in CA could set their clocks to use Mountain time with no DST.
These option settings do not provide any way to specify Eastern daylight
time during winter, however, so if an east- coast state (like Florida) moves
to year-round DST, &quot;atomic&quot; clocks in use there will be an hour off for four
months out of the year.

Two possible solutions would be either to add a third DST setting (i.e., DST
always on), or else to add a fifth time zone (Atlantic) and tell consumers
in the affected states to select Atlantic time with no DST.  Affected
consumers would, of course, need to buy new clocks, since it's impossible to
upgrade the firmware in existing clocks.

*The cybersecurity company says it's seen hackers get deep access into the
Macs of regular users.*

EXCERPT:

It's long been legend that Macs are harder to hack than other computers.
Not only are they said to be more secure, but fewer people use them, so
hackers have less incentive to break in.
&lt;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tags/hacking/">https://www.cnet.com/tags/hacking/</a>

Cybersecurity company Crowdstrike is happy to bust that myth. At the RSA
Conference on Thursday, CEO George Kurtz and CTO Dmitri Alperovitch
detailed hacking techniques they've seen used to do a host of bad things on
Apple-built computers.
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/apple/">https://www.cnet.com/apple/</a>

Attackers can trick Mac users into downloading malicious software and then
get deep access into the computer, the Crowdstrike executives said. They
also have tools to loot the system's keychain for more passwords and build
backdoors into the machines, allowing hackers to have repeated access.

&quot;They have interesting tradecraft on Macs,&quot; Alperovitch said of the hackers.
The Crowdstrike presentation comes in the wake of a flaw found in Apple's
Facetime app
&lt;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-facetime-bug-was-discovered-by-a-teen-playing-fortnite/">https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-facetime-bug-was-discovered-by-a-teen-playing-fortnite/</a>&gt;

which stores the passwords of apps connected to a Mac. Taken together,
these flaws mean Mac users should take steps to keep their computers secure

  A woman was attacked by a jaguar as she was apparently trying to get a

  Shawn Gilleland, a spokesman for the Rural Metro Fire Department, told The
  Washington Post on Sunday that fire crews said the woman, who is in her
  30s, climbed over a barrier at the zoo Saturday to get closer to the
  jaguar's enclosure so that she could get a selfie with the animal. The
  jaguar reached out and grabbed her arm with its paw, leaving lacerations,
  Gilleland said.

Supporters of enterprise blockchains say they tend to work best in
situations where people want to share tamper-resistant data among many
parties. Critics of the technology argue that it offers little in the way of
improvement over traditional database software; still other critics say the
technology doesn't truly qualify as a blockchain unless it is public and
open and has a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, tied to it.

As usual, no explanation of what &quot;tracking tuna on a blockchain&quot; MEANS...

...as in, how is an individual fish&#8212;or shipment&#8212;irrevocably tied to a
transaction or data?

The Swiss challenge to hack their voting system has moved along.  Three
independent research groups have announced a vulnerability that permits the
undetectable insertion of bogus votes (and alteration of existing ones?).

One of the URLs listed in the Editorial comment had health-data links that
shared an ironic similarity of some Facebook postings.

<a href="https://www.naturalhealth365.com/vaccinations-autism-news-2849.html">https://www.naturalhealth365.com/vaccinations-autism-news-2849.html</a>

By comparison, a Slashdot article noted:

I have followed RISKS for decades, finding it providing education and
information not widely available. I did not expect to be reminded of a
newspaper city editor's skepticism in &quot;if your mother says she loves you,
check it out.&quot;

(I recognize that this email is likely to be trashed.  [No.  Sorry, I could
not do that.  PGN]  Thus the reference to who will bell the cat.  I do find
your work on RISKS large-hearted and helping inestimably in pushing back the
FUD.)  Mark Norem

Here in Canada a number of classes of operations are exempt from having to
comply with the National CRTC Do Not Call List, in particular politicians
and their Opinion Polling Allies, among other exceptions.

However each of these entities is required to clearly identify themselves,
and to stop talking if you interrupt. At that point you can order them to
add your number to their own internal Do Not Call List, giving you a
confirmation code. After that they cannot call you again. This seems to be
cloaked in Security by Obscurity, few people seem aware of these secondary
DNC lists.

Am I an exempt telemarketer?

* registered charities raising funds newspapers looking for subscriptions

* Being an exempt telemarketer does not eliminate your responsibility
to maintain your own internal do not call list.

* You must also maintain your own internal do not call list ...

* You can't call or send faxes to the consumers on your own internal

 CenturyLink, one of the largest telecommunications providers in the U.S.,
 provides Internet and phone backbone services to major cell carriers,
 including AT&amp;T and Verizon. Datacenter or fiber issues can have a knock-on
 effect to other companies, cutting out service and causing cell site
 blackouts. In this case, the outage affected only cellular calls to 911,
 and not landline calls.

I don't know if Huawei devices have &quot;kill switches&quot; or &quot;backdoors&quot;, but if
they did, the big iron-y would be rich indeed.

For decades, the 5i's have pushed for &quot;backdoors&quot; in encryption and pseudo
RNG's, and the laughable number of &quot;backdoors&quot; in Cisco and Juniper routers
belie any plausible deniability; thar be NSL's, most likely.

Let's call a spade a spade; let's call them &quot;blowbackdoors&quot;, because the
U.S. intelligence community is now reaping what it sowed.

The intel community's current freakout is raw jealousy&#8212;if the 5G device
manufacturers in the 5i countries could be forced to insert &quot;kill switches&quot;
and &quot;backdoors&quot; into their own products and distribute them worldwide, it
would be done in a New York minute&#8212;so they know full well whereof they
speak.

Also, ignoring its own history of winning wars through manufacturing
prowess, the U.S. has now ceded the vast majority of its manufacturing to
China, only to wake up just yesterday to the fact that it is now more
&quot;taker&quot; than &quot;maker&quot; ?

Duh!!

The 6 reasons why Huawei gives the US and its allies security nightmares

The biggest fear is that China could exploit the telecom giant's gear
to wreak havoc in a crisis.

Martin Giles and Elizabeth Woyke December 7, 2018

The detention in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's CFO and the daughter of
its founder, is further inflaming tensions between the US and China.  Her
arrest is linked to a US extradition request.  On December 7 a Canadian
court heard that the request relates to Huawei's alleged use of Skycom Tech,
a company that dealt with Iranian telecom firms, to sell equipment to Iran
between 2009 and 2014 in contravention of US sanctions on the country.
China says her detention is a human rights violation and is demanding her
swift release.

Behind this very public drama is a long-running, behind-the-scenes one
centered on Western intelligence agencies' fears that Huawei poses a
significant threat to global security.  Among the spooks' biggest concerns:

    There could be &quot;kill switches&quot; in Huawei equipment ...

The Chinese firm is the world's largest manufacturer of things like base
stations and antennas that mobile operators use to run wireless networks.
And those networks carry data that's used to help control power grids,
financial markets, transport systems, and other parts of countries' vital
infrastructure.  The fear is that China's military and intelligence services
could insert software or hardware &quot;back doors&quot; into Huawei's gear that they
could exploit to degrade or disable foreign wireless networks in the event
of a crisis.  This has led to moves in the US to block Chinese equipment
from being used.

     ... that even close inspections miss

Since 2010, the UK has been running a special center, whose staff includes
members of its GCHQ signal intelligence agency, to vet Huawei gear before
it's deployed.  But earlier this year, it warned that it had &quot;only limited
assurance&quot; that the company's equipment didn't pose a security threat.
According to press reports, the center had found that some of Huawei's code
behaved differently on actual networks from the way it did when it was
tested, and that some of its software suppliers weren't subject to rigorous
controls.

    Back doors could be used for data snooping

Huawei claims its equipment connects over a third of the world's population.
It's also handling vast amounts of data for businesses.  That's why there's
fear in Western intelligence circles that back doors could be used to tap
into sensitive information using the firm's equipment.  This would be tricky
to do undetected, but not impossible.  Huawei doesn't just build equipment;
it can also connect to it wirelessly to issue upgrades and patches to fix
bugs.  There's concern that this remote connectivity could be exploited by
Chinese cyber spies.

The company is also one of the world's biggest makers of smartphones and
other consumer devices, which has raised the prospect that China might
exploit these products for espionage.  In May, the US Department of Defense
ordered retail stores on US military bases to stop selling phones from
Huawei and ZTE, another big Chinese tech giant, because of fears they could
be hacked to reveal the locations and movements of military personnel.

    The rollout of 5G wireless networks will make everything worse

Telecom companies around the world are about to roll out the next generation
of cellular wireless, known as 5G.  As well as speeding up data transfers,
5G networks will enable self-driving cars to talk to each other and to
things like smart traffic lights.  They'll also connect and control a vast
number of robots in factories and other locations.  And the military will
use them for all kinds of applications, too.  This will dramatically expand
the number of connected devices--and the chaos that can be caused if the
networks supporting them are hacked.  It will also ramp up the amount of
corporate and other data that hackers can target.  Both Australia and New
Zealand have recently banned the use of Huawei equipment in new 5G wireless
infrastructure.  This week, the UK's BT followed suit.

    Chinese firms will ship tech to countries in defiance of a US trade embargo

The US has been investigating claims that Huawei shipped products with US
tech components to Iran and other countries subject to a US embargo.  In the
court hearing, a lawyer for the Canadian government said that Ms Meng is
accused of telling US bankers there was no connection between Skycom and
Huawei, when in fact there was.  The alleged fraud caused the banks to make
transactions that violated US sanctions against Iran.  Chinese officials
have repeatedly said they don't consider China's companies to be bound by
other nations' trade edicts.

    Huawei isn't as immune to Chinese government influence as it claims to be

Huawei has repeatedly stressed it's a private company that's owned by its
employees.  The implication is that it has no incentive to cause customers
to lose confidence in the integrity of its products.  On the other hand, its
governance structures are still something of a mystery, and its founder, Ren
Zhengfei, who was once an officer in the Chinese People's Liberation Army,
keeps a low profile.  Such things &quot;make you question just how much
independence it really has,&quot; says Adam Segal, a cybersecurity expert at the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

In its defense, Huawei can point to the fact that no security researchers
have found back doors in its products.  &quot;There's all this concern, but
there's never been a smoking gun,&quot; says Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group.
While that's true, it won't change the view of the US, which is stepping up
its efforts to persuade its allies to keep Huawei out of all their networks.

This story was updated on December 7 to include details of a court hearing
in Canada about Ms Meng's detention.

The computers, sensors and software in cars are getting so smart they may
eventually detect whether the driver and passengers are happy or sad,
comfortable or uncomfortable, alert or distracted. And as a result, driving
automobiles can be made safer and more enjoyable.

&#8220;Driver monitoring is extremely important for active safety systems as well
as automated systems,'' says Phil Magney, founder and principal at VSI Labs,
an automotive technology applied research firm-based in St.  Louis Park, MN.
&#8220;It may have been a nice-to-have feature beforehand. Now you can say it
definitely is a must-have feature.''

Nevertheless, he says, car occupant monitoring overall remains in a state of
flux&#8212;particularly regarding user experience.  ...

For example, Shapiro says a camera inside the vehicle could determine a
driver's attentiveness by detecting their eye blink rate and sensing their
head pose. These checks could also determine if the driver is close to
falling asleep. This could be merged with input from outside sensors that
detect a pedestrian preparing to cross the car's path. And the car may then
determine if it needs to issue a collision warning and autobrake sooner than
it would otherwise, to give a tired or distracted driver extra time to
react, Shapiro says.

Emotion-sensing technology could lead the car to take actions proactively,
such as playing certain music or adjusting cabin temperature. Or it may make
suggestions and engage in a conversation with a passenger, for instance,
offering to lower a window if lip-reading software senses someone
complaining about being hot.

&quot;In field trials conducted in September 2017 at a New York state park, the

<a href="https://lauren.vortex.com/2019/01/02/usa-wants-to-restrict-ai-exports-a-stupid-and-dangerous-idea">https://lauren.vortex.com/2019/01/02/usa-wants-to-restrict-ai-exports-a-stupid-and-dangerous-idea</a>

When small, closed minds tackle big issues, the results are rarely good, and
frequently are awful. This tends to be especially true when governments
attempt to restrict the development and evolution of technology. Not only do
those attempts routinely fail at their stated and ostensible purposes, but
they often do massive self-inflicted damage along the way, and end up
further empowering our adversaries.

Much as Trump's expensive fantasy wall (&quot;Mexico will pay for it!&quot;)  would
have little ultimate impact on genuine immigration problems&#8212;other than to
further exacerbate them&#8212;his Commerce department's new plans for
restricting the export of technologies such as AI, speech recognition,
natural language understanding, and computer vision would be yet another
unforced error that could decimate the USA's leading role in these areas.

We've been down this kind of road before. Years ago, the USA federal
government placed draconian restrictions on the export of encryption
technologies, classifying them as a form of munitions. The result was that
the rest of the world zoomed ahead in crypto tech. This also triggered
famously bizarre situations like t-shirts with encryption source code
printed on them being restricted, and the co-inventor of the UNIX operating
system&#8212;Ken Thompson&#8212;battling to take his &quot;Belle&quot; chess-playing
computer outside the country, because the U.S.  government felt that various
of the chips inside fell into this restricted category. (At the time, Ken
was reportedly quoted as saying that the only way you could hurt someone
with Belle was by dropping it out of a plane&#8212;you might kill someone if it
hit them!)

As is the case with AI and the other technologies that Commerce is talking
about restricting today, encryption R&amp;D information is widely shared among
researchers, and likewise, any attempts to stop these new technologies from
being widely available, even attempts at restricting access to them by
specific countries on our designated blacklist of the moment, will
inevitably fail.

Even worse, the reaction of the global community to such ill-advised actions
by the U.S. will inevitably tend to put us at a disadvantage yet again, as
other countries with more intelligent and insightful leadership race ahead
leaving us behind in the dust of politically motivated export control
regimes.

To restrict the export of AI and affiliated technologies is shortsighted,
dangerous, and will only accomplish damaging our own interests, by
restricting our ability to participate fully and openly in these crucial
areas.  It's the kind of self-destructive thinking that we've come to expect
from the anti-science, &quot;build walls&quot; Trump administration, but it must be
firmly and completely rejected nonetheless.

<i>Wed, 2 Jan 2019 11:50:47 -0800</i><pre>
A while ago there were a number of stories about investigations into serious
assaults at a private school.  These assaults have gone way beyond hazing
and into sexual assault, and even, because the episodes were filmed,
possible child pornography charges.  The situation has been very disturbing.

Hazing, and hazing culture, are often &quot;justified&quot; by the assertion that
&quot;mild&quot; forms of hazing are harmless.  This statement ignores two important
facts.  One is that hazing inherently relies upon a culture of silence.  In
any such situation there can be no controls, and therefore no ability to
ensure that &quot;mild&quot; hazing does not escalate.  The second point is that
hazing is a form of bullying, and it has been amply demonstrated that any
form of bullying has long term negative impacts, both on the victims, and on
the perpetrators.

I've never understood hazing.  Not really.  It happens a lot in sports, and
I've never been into sports.  It happens in some professions, but not the
ones I've worked in.  As far as I can determine, hazing, and all the culture
that goes with it, indicates that your job is either a) not very important,
or b) doesn't require any skills.

I can't say I've experienced it in information security.  I started in
malware research, which has always been occupied by charter members of
&quot;Egos-BackwardsR-Us.&quot;  Back when I started you had to be not just a systems
  programmer, but a specialist systems programmer to make a significant
contribution to the field, and those guys have always been the elite.  Even
so, if you studied and made even a modest contribution, you were in.  I
wasn't a systems programmer, and my contributions were very modest.  But I
was accepted.

It's probably because the job was so big, and the workers so small (or too
few).  Anybody who wanted to help was welcome.  Anybody who wanted to do
some research would be given some tips and starters.  Anybody who helped was
in the community.  Nobody had to jump through artificial hoops because the
real barriers to entry were already formidable enough.

(Actually, there were some in computer security, back then, who did try to
keep you out.  They were the ones who knew barely enough to charge for
computer security consulting.  Some of them claimed that computer viruses
were not a security issue&#8212;mostly because they didn't know what computer
viruses were.)

Come to think of it, I've never really seen hazing in the tech field, as
such.  Oh, there are jerks, I grant you.  There are those who are so into
the technology that social skills, human communication, and even personal
hygiene take a very distant back seat to whatever they are working on right
now.  But, generally speaking, they don't try to keep you out.  They may
have given up trying to teach people what it is that they are doing but, if
you take the time to try and learn, they are generally delighted to have
someone to talk to.  (They may not show it very well.)

(The closest I've ever seen hazing in tech is the ITIL certification.  Since
ITIL is a library, it's hard to figure out how to certify that someone knows
it.  Since it's hard to assess that, you just drown the poor candidate in
work and hope that the ones who don't know it will give up before they get
to the end of the process.  I think PMP runs it a close second.)

I suppose I have to address the issue of women in tech.  Yes, women are
definitely underrepresented in tech.  And, yes, there is a lot of irrational
bias against women, as you find in any male-dominated field.  (Not just from
the techies: I've found it in management, too, where you'd think they should
know better.)  I do not want to minimize the issue: misogyny anywhere is
ridiculous and wasteful.  But sometimes it doesn't take much to make geeks
realize they've been sexist jerks, and make some (possibly modest) changes.
In one department I came in to manage, they regularly went to strip bars
after work, and had a signed poster from one of the &quot;performers&quot; up on the
wall.  As I was hiring the first (female) secretary for the office, I noted
that this wall decoration might be subject to less prominent placement.  I
never saw the poster again, and the team also removed the porn directory on
the development server (which I'd never mentioned).

I can't claim that all is sweetness and light in the security community.
There are in-fights: there are personality clashes.  And there are those who
are in it just to claim status.  The community usually sorts them out in
short order.  Status, in security, is most often achieved by helping others.
If you can answer newbie questions; if your answers are true and useful;
then you have status.  If you try and claim status, and try and hold others
back in order to hold onto it, you are the one who gets shunned.

In information security, we have too much work, and too few resources.  We
don't have time to waste on hazing.  We also aren't going to block anyone
who actually wants to help.  In any security community I've been part of,
newbies are welcome.  OK, dumb questions may get sarcastic responses, but
they have to be pretty seriously stupid to make the grade.  Otherwise, if
someone wants to get in and help, those of us who can answer questions do.
Ask, and a pointer will be given.  Seek, and ye shall be given a direction
to go find.  Knock, and the door will be opened, and you'll be hustled in,
and usually put to work right away.

  A hacker, known as Hacker Giraffe, has become the latest person to figure
  out how to trick Google's media streamer into playing any YouTube video
  they want&#8212;including videos that are custom-made. This time around, the
  hacker hijacked thousands of Chromecasts, forcing them to display a pop-up
  notice that's viewable on the connected TV, warning the user that their
  misconfigured router is exposing their Chromecast and smart TV to hackers
  like himself.  Not one to waste an opportunity, the hacker also asks that
  you subscribe to PewDiePie, an awful Internet person with a popular
  YouTube following. (He's the same hacker who tricked thousands of exposed
  printers into printing support for PewDiePie.)

Google should have fixed this Chromecast bug years ago. On the other hand,
UPnP has always been a train wreck, and that's not Google's fault.

  years, used to be on Google's My Maps service, a feature of Google Maps
  that enables users to create custom maps for personal use or sharing

  through their personal account, it remains unknown if their rights have
  been violated or if they will appeal.

If the Turkish government wants the map removed as shown to users

A problem that *I* have with this sort of thing is the idea that the answer
to any problem is legislation&#8212;it can only fix things if it's enforceable
*and* enforced.  In the UK, a common response to the Gatwick drone incident
was &quot;why was this allowed to happen?&quot;, as if tougher regulations would stop
illicit drones without further action.  For instance, we have very strict
firearms laws in the UK (to the extent that an Olympic sport is illegal),
but most gun crime involves the use of illegal guns, so even-stricter laws
won't help.

In the case of Google, in recent years there have been occasional incidents
like the following example in the UK: when one wants to obtain or renew a
passport, driver's licence, travel visa, or suchlike, or pay a road toll,
one normally contacts the appropriate authority and pays the fee directly.
What happens is that people Google for &quot;passport/licence/visa/whatever&quot; and
are presented with a choice of sites, then one of two things may happen:

(1) They actually get the site of an agency, who promise a prompt, efficient
service at a competitive price (the site may imply that this can only be
done through an agency, as I believe is the case in some countries), so they
get their new passport/licence/visa/whatever but unexpectedly pay an
unnecessary supplemental charge.  (As I understand it, this is cheeky but
legal.)

(2) They get an impostor site which looks exactly like an official one, but
again they may either pay an unnecessary fee and/or personal details are
captured for identity theft.

The usual response of victims is to say &quot;why is Google allowed to show links
to unofficial sites?&quot;, as if Google should have a legal obligation to verify
the bona fides of every site indexed, which sounds impractical to me,
especially considering different countries' legal systems which may be
encountered.  In the days of printed directories for land- line telephones,
there used to be a note in the small print that any professional or business
descriptions shown were as supplied by subscribers and not independently
verified, so for instance a guy listed as 'dentist' may not actually be
approved to practise dentistry, as it was not practical for a telephone
company to check details like this.

Incidentally, a commentator in a newspaper (don't have details to hand)
recently predicted that the World Wide Web would likely become the
'Splinternet', i.e., a series of walled gardens, in 5-10 years; I feel that
this will happen much sooner.

<a href="https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2018/03/irs-system-processing-your-taxes-almost-60-years-old/146770/">https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2018/03/irs-system-processing-your-taxes-almost-60-years-old/146770/</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_Account_Data_Engine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_Account_Data_Engine</a>

For those too lazy to follow the links, two of the applications involved are
at sixty years old &quot;the oldest code in .gov&quot; and are made of 20M lines of
assembly that IRS, IBM, Northrop Grumman, and a bunch of assorted
subcontractors been failing to port to The Big Iron since the turn of the
century.

Back in 2000 it was COBOL and Java were going to show what they can do for
the American taxpayer. Now it's zLinux to the rescue.

&gt;  * 33% of U.S. Nobel Laureates since 1901 have been immigrants.
&gt;  * 40% of American doctoral degrees were awarded to noncitizens.
&gt;  * More than 25% of American entrepeneurs were born overseas.

People in New York live longer than people elsewhere in the U.S.  Why?
Because 38% of New Yorkers are immigrants, and immigrants live longer than
people born in the US, per this 2014 paper:

So, are we to conclude from this item that Google ought to be faithful to
the laws and regulations of the respective nations in which it operates?

If so, then what about Google's censored searches for China?  Oh, but that's
different, right?

Umm, not using Gmail?  You agreed to Terms which give Google the right to
MODIFY contents too (the right persists in the new Terms that take effect on
22 January 2019).  The &quot;limitations&quot; on that right are woolly enough to
permit Google to even alter email, which may come in handy when people start
sending or receiving too much email critical of Google..

I know that sadly, anything Google does is perfectly legal; my post was
meant mainly to attract attention to their unfair conduct.

Released on 19DEC2018, the incident investigation summary report found:

&quot;The Panel concluded that the root cause was the different software counter
re-initialization arrangements of the two connected systems when the
re-initialization was activated at the incident time on 16 October
2018. Since the four lines are connected, the inconsistent re-initialization
situation led to repeated re-synchronization causing instability in sector
computers. The software counter re-initialization algorithm, the differences
in the counter re-initialization arrangements between the Alstom and Siemens
systems and the possible impact on the train service were not known to the
operators and maintainers, nor were they explicitly described in the
Operation and Maintenance Manuals.&quot;

RISK: Communication gap between multiple vendors governing train signaling
system journey counter re-initialization protocol alignment.

Appears that software engineers did not account for train journey counter
reset conditions as part of system integration test for signaling system
release qualification. Non-existent disclosure of counter re-initialization
state dependency by either vendor implies there was a common operational
assumption about, but not verification of, self-consistent signaling
platform state management.  No mention of counter word-length in the summary
report.
