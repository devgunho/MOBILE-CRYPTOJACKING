legality and the effectiveness of the N.S.A.âs practice of collecting unlimited records of telephone calls made to, from, and within the United States. Last month, two federal judges came to opposing conclusions about these issues. On December 16th, Judge Richard J. Leon, in Washington, D.C., ruled that the indiscriminate hoarding violates the Fourth Amendment right to privacy and its prohibition of unreasonable searches. Two weeks later, in New York, Judge William H. Pauley III ruled that the metadata-collection program was lawful and effective.</p><p>Judge Pauley invoked the example of Khalid al-Mihdhar, a Saudi jihadist who worked for Al Qaeda. On 9/11, he was one of the five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon. In early 2000, Mihdhar made seven calls from San Diego to an Al Qaeda safe house in Yemen. According to Pauley, the N.S.A. intercepted the calls, but couldnât identify where Mihdhar was calling from. Relying on testimony by Robert Mueller, the former director of the F.B.I., Pauley concluded that metadata collection could have allowed the bureau to discover that the calls were being made from the U.S., in which case the bureau could have stopped 9/11.</p><p>If he is right, advocates of extensive monitoring by the government have a strong case. But the Mihdhar calls tell a different story about why the bureau failed to prevent the catastrophe. The C.I.A. withheld crucial intelligence from the F.B.I., which has the ultimate authority to investigate terrorism in the U.S. and attacks on Americans abroad.</p><p>In August, 1998, truck bombs destroyed two American Embassies, in Kenya and Tanzania, killing two hundred and twenty-four people. Three days later, F.B.I. investigators captured a young Saudi named Mohammad al-âOwhali at a hotel outside Nairobi. He had fresh stitches in his forehead and bloody bandages on his hands. In his pocket were eight brand-new hundred-dollar bills. Two skilled interrogators, Steve Gaudin and John Anticev, persuaded âOwhali to write down the number he called after the bombing. It belonged to Khalid al-Mihdharâs father-in-law, Ahmed al-Hada, and was one of the most important pieces of information ever obtained in the effort to prevent terrorist acts in the U.S. It became known as the Al Qaeda switchboard.</p><p>The N.S.A.âs tracking of calls to and from the Hada household allowed the F.B.I. to map the global network of Al Qaeda. But not all the information was shared. In 1999, Mihdharâs name surfaced in one of the recorded calls, linking him to Al Qaeda. âSomething nefarious might be afoot,â an N.S.A. analyst wrote, but Mihdharâs name was not passed on to the F.B.I.</p><p>Saudi intelligence also alerted the C.I.A. that Mihdhar and his friend Nawaf al-Hazmi, another future hijacker, were members of Al Qaeda. In December, 1999, the C.I.A. learned through the Al Qaeda switchboard that the two would be travelling to Malaysia for a meeting in early January. The agency broke into Mihdharâs hotel room in Dubai and photographed his passport, which had a multi-entry visa to the U.S. That information was not given to the F.B.I.; nor was the State Department told to revoke his visa, or Immigration to place Mihdhar and Hazmi on the list of people forbidden to enter the U.S. The C.I.A. evidently had begun an operation, and it wanted no interference from other government agencies.</p><p>The meeting in Malaysia turned out to be an Al Qaeda summit to discuss plans for 9/11 and the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, which took place in October, 2000. The C.I.A. had its Malaysian counterparts conduct surveillance of the meeting, but did not show that informationâmainly photographs of the participantsâto the F.B.I., in effect obstructing its investigation into the deaths of seventeen American sailors.</p><p>When the cable about Mihdharâs U.S. visa and the Malaysia meeting arrived at the C.I.A.âs Counterterrorism Center, an F.B.I. officer sought permission to transmit the findings to the bureau. Although there was a protocol to allow the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. to exchange critical information, he was told, âThis is not a matter for the F.B.I.â</p><p>Three months later, the C.I.A. learned from Thai intelligence that Hazmi had arrived in Los Angeles on January 15, 2000. If the agency had checked the flight manifest, it would have found that Mihdhar was travelling with him. Mihdhar and Hazmi moved to San Diego and began taking flying lessons. And Mihdhar began calling Yemen.</p><p>Judge Pauley cites the 9/11 Commission Report for his statement that telephone metadata âmight have permitted the N.S.A. to notify the [F.B.I.] of the fact that al-Mihdhar was calling the Yemeni safe house from inside the United States.â What the report actually says is that the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. already knew that Al Qaeda was in America, based on the N.S.A.âs monitoring of the Hada phone. If they had told the F.B.I., the agents would have established a link to the embassy-bombings case, which âwould have made them very interested in learning more about Mihdhar.â Instead, âthe agents who found the source were being kept from obtaining the fruits of their work.â</p><p>The N.S.A. failed to understand the significance of the calls between the U.S. and Yemen. The C.I.A. had access to the intelligence, and knew that Al Qaeda was in the U.S. almost two years before 9/11. An investigation by the C.I.A.âs inspector general found that up to sixty people in the agency knew that<span data-page="page_final"></span> Al Qaeda operatives were in America. The inspector general said that those who refused to coÃ¶perate with the F.B.I. should be held accountable. Instead, they were promoted.</p><p>Yes, the F.B.I. could have stopped 9/11. It had a warrant to establish surveillance of everyone connected to Al Qaeda in America. It could follow them, tap their phones, clone their computers, read their e-mails, and subpoena their medical, bank, and credit-card records. It had the right to demand records from telephone companies of any calls they had made. There was no need for a metadata-collection program. What was needed was coÃ¶peration with other federal agencies, but for reasons both petty and obscure those agencies chose to hide vital clues from the investigators most likely to avert the attacks.</p><p>The intelligence community has since been reorganized to prevent such closeting of information. Many terrorist schemes have been discovered and prevented. But questions remain about how the C.I.A. handled events leading up to 9/11. What did the agency intend to do about the Al Qaeda operatives in America? The former national-security adviser Richard Clarke believes that the C.I.A. hoped to recruit them.</p><p>Edward Snowden broke the law, and the Obama Administration has demanded that he be brought to justice. No one has died because of his revelations. The C.I.A.âs obstruction of justice in the Cole investigation arguably also was a crime. Its failure to share information from the Al Qaeda switchboard opened the door to the biggest terrorist attack in history.

started a critical debate about the legality and the effectiveness of the N.S.A.âs practice of collecting unlimited records of telephone calls made to, from, and within the United States. Last month, two federal judges came to opposing conclusions about these issues. On December 16th, Judge Richard J. Leon, in Washington, D.C., ruled that the indiscriminate hoarding violates the Fourth Amendment right to privacy and its prohibition of unreasonable searches. Two weeks later, in New York, Judge William H. Pauley III ruled that the metadata-collection program was lawful and effective."],["p","Judge Pauley invoked the example of Khalid al-Mihdhar, a Saudi jihadist who worked for Al Qaeda. On 9/11, he was one of the five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon. In early 2000, Mihdhar made seven calls from San Diego to an Al Qaeda safe house in Yemen. According to Pauley, the N.S.A. intercepted the calls, but couldnât identify where Mihdhar was calling from. Relying on testimony by Robert Mueller, the former director of the F.B.I., Pauley concluded that metadata collection could have allowed the bureau to discover that the calls were being made from the U.S., in which case the bureau could have stopped 9/11."],["p","If he is right, advocates of extensive monitoring by the government have a strong case. But the Mihdhar calls tell a different story about why the bureau failed to prevent the catastrophe. The C.I.A. withheld crucial intelligence from the F.B.I., which has the ultimate authority to investigate terrorism in the U.S. and attacks on Americans abroad."],["p","In August, 1998, truck bombs destroyed two American Embassies, in Kenya and Tanzania, killing two hundred and twenty-four people. Three days later, F.B.I. investigators captured a young Saudi named Mohammad al-âOwhali at a hotel outside Nairobi. He had fresh stitches in his forehead and bloody bandages on his hands. In his pocket were eight brand-new hundred-dollar bills. Two skilled interrogators, Steve Gaudin and John Anticev, persuaded âOwhali to write down the number he called after the bombing. It belonged to Khalid al-Mihdharâs father-in-law, Ahmed al-Hada, and was one of the most important pieces of information ever obtained in the effort to prevent terrorist acts in the U.S. It became known as the Al Qaeda switchboard."],["p","The N.S.A.âs tracking of calls to and from the Hada household allowed the F.B.I. to map the global network of Al Qaeda. But not all the information was shared. In 1999, Mihdharâs name surfaced in one of the recorded calls, linking him to Al Qaeda. âSomething nefarious might be afoot,â an N.S.A. analyst wrote, but Mihdharâs name was not passed on to the F.B.I."],["p","Saudi intelligence also alerted the C.I.A. that Mihdhar and his friend Nawaf al-Hazmi, another future hijacker, were members of Al Qaeda. In December, 1999, the C.I.A. learned through the Al Qaeda switchboard that the two would be travelling to Malaysia for a meeting in early January. The agency broke into Mihdharâs hotel room in Dubai and photographed his passport, which had a multi-entry visa to the U.S. That information was not given to the F.B.I.; nor was the State Department told to revoke his visa, or Immigration to place Mihdhar and Hazmi on the list of people forbidden to enter the U.S. The C.I.A. evidently had begun an operation, and it wanted no interference from other government agencies."],["p","The meeting in Malaysia turned out to be an Al Qaeda summit to discuss plans for 9/11 and the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, which took place in October, 2000. The C.I.A. had its Malaysian counterparts conduct surveillance of the meeting, but did not show that informationâmainly photographs of the participantsâto the F.B.I., in effect obstructing its investigation into the deaths of seventeen American sailors."],["p","When the cable about Mihdharâs U.S. visa and the Malaysia meeting arrived at the C.I.A.âs Counterterrorism Center, an F.B.I. officer sought permission to transmit the findings to the bureau. Although there was a protocol to allow the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. to exchange critical information, he was told, âThis is not a matter for the F.B.I.â"],["p","Three months later, the C.I.A. learned from Thai intelligence that Hazmi had arrived in Los Angeles on January 15, 2000. If the agency had checked the flight manifest, it would have found that Mihdhar was travelling with him. Mihdhar and Hazmi moved to San Diego and began taking flying lessons. And Mihdhar began calling Yemen."],["p","Judge Pauley cites the 9/11 Commission Report for his statement that telephone metadata âmight have permitted the N.S.A. to notify the [F.B.I.] of the fact that al-Mihdhar was calling the Yemeni safe house from inside the United States.â What the report actually says is that the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. already knew that Al Qaeda was in America, based on the N.S.A.âs monitoring of the Hada phone.

last time Brazil hosted the World Cup, in 1950, two hundred thousand peopleâa tenth of the population of Rio de Janeiroâstreamed into the newly completed MaracanÃ£ Stadium to watch their beloved national team, the SeleÃ§Ã£o, compete for the title against Uruguay. A monumental concrete bowl, intended to rival the Christ statue atop Corcovado, the MaracanÃ£ resembled a spaceship and was meant to embody, as the British journalist Alex Bellos writes in âFutebol: The Brazilian Way of Life,â not only Brazilâs athletic ambition but also âthe countryâs place in the modern world.â Its capacity was greater by several magnitudes than any other Brazilian stadium. Some ten thousand men had contributed to its construction, practicing goal celebrations while they worked. Theyâd even, somehow, finished ahead of schedule."],["p","Then Brazil lost, 2â1. Back home, while listening on the radio, three Uruguayans reportedly died of excitement. In the MaracanÃ£, there was stunned, eerie silence, so unfathomable and disconcerting that it left a formative wound in the national psyche. The novelist Nelson Rodrigues identified the moment as the source of his countryâs âstray-dog complexâââthe inferiority with which the Brazilian positions himself, voluntarily, in front of the rest of the world.â In spite of the five World Cups that Brazil has won sinceâmore than any other countryâthe MaracanÃ£ humiliation remains the most intellectualized aspect of its sporting legacy, if not of its modern history altogether. âWhen the players needed the MaracanÃ£ most, the MaracanÃ£ was silent,â the singer, songwriter, and poet Chico Buarque once declared. âYou canât entrust yourself to a football stadiumâthatâs the lesson that sunk in after 1950.â"],["p","The lesson may have been forgotten. The economic boom that recently brought Brazil, with its burgeoning middle class, to the brink of First World respect has been dizzying. This June, the opening gameâBrazil vs. Croatiaâof what the ",["em","New Statesman"]," suggests may be the last World Cup that ever matters will be played at the ItaquerÃ£o, a new stadium going up in SÃ£o Paulo for the storied Corinthians, a professional team known both for its historical ties to the proletariat and for its thuggish fans. The stadium, a monument to gentrification, will feature the largest digital screen on earth and lighting twice as bright as that used in Munichâs Allianz Arena, said to be visible, on a clear night, from nearly fifty miles away. âThe idea was to build the best, biggest shopping mall in the world, with a soccer field in the middle,â AndrÃ©s SÃ¡nchez, the former Corinthians president, who is supervising the construction, told me, sounding more like Donald Trump than like a steward of the ",["em","jogo bonito"],", or beautiful game. Every square metre on the premises has been plotted as a âmoney-making scheme.â No stray dog, SÃ¡nchez likes to say that Corinthians has âchanged the way Brazilian football thinks,â and, between cigarettes, which he tossed on the floor, half smoked, he argued with the conviction that history was now on his side. Europe was in decline, and it was only a matter of timeâeconomic determinism, reallyâbefore its fabled clubs would cede their monopoly on the best players. True, the Brazilian professional league still had some kinks to work out, but even so, he said, âweâre easily going to surpass the European teams, and we will be the best championship in the world.â"],["p","This boast was of no small importance. The ",["em","New Statesman"]," argument, perhaps overstated, that this might be the last significant World Cup reflects an increasing reality of globalization. The top professional leagues have achieved such international reach, both in filling out their rosters and in the fan bases from which they draw their support, that the allure of ostensibly amateur spectacles like the World Cup and the Olympics (which Brazil will host, too, in 2016) is diminished by comparison. We associate Lionel Messi, by consensus the best player in the world, as much, if not more, with Barcelona, for whom he plays most of the year, as with his native Argentina. Last spring, Neymar, Brazilâs next great hope, decamped for Barcelona to join him.

But this World Cup belongs in many respects to the legacy of Brazilâs ex-President Lula da Silva, a populist and a rabid Corinthians fan, who within months of taking office, in 2003, signed legislation for a soccer fansâ bill of rights. Dilma Rousseff, Lulaâs more technocratic successor (and Brazilâs first woman President), saw her popularity plummet last June, as a wave of protestsâan echo of the Occupy movementâsent more than a million students and young professionals into the streets of Brazilâs cities. (Lately, in the wake of the Edward Snowden affair, Rousseffâs standoffishness toward the Obama Administration has helped her in the polls.) The protests were spurred, notionally, by a twenty-cent increase in bus fares, but it was no accident that they coincided with the Confederation Cupâa kind of World Cup dress rehearsalâand the disturbance was seen in some ways as an indication that the country was outgrowing its long romance with the sport. Among the protestersâ chief grievances was the huge public expenditure on showy stadiums instead of on grownup concerns, like improving public transportation, schools, and hospitals."],["p","At least the ItaquerÃ£o will have a major team to play in it after the World Cup. But what will become of the newly refurbished seventy-thousand-seat Estadio Nacional, in BrasÃ­lia, a city whose biggest club plays in the D league, to crowds regularly numbering in the hundreds? (One worker has died on the project.) Or consider the Arena Amazonia, in Manaus, a city in the northwest surrounded by two million acres of rain forest. Its opera house, completed in 1896, served as the inspiration for Werner Herzogâs âFitzcarraldo,â about the folly of grandiose jungle construction. The stadium builders had first to drain a river tributary that flowed through the proposed site, in the state of Amazonas, and then to install seats with a special kind of paint that doesnât melt under the equatorial sun. No club from Amazonas has competed in top-level play in Brazil in thirty years. Two workers died while building the stadium. âWe always think in Brazil there will be a miracle,â Paulo Vinicius Coelho, the Brazilian Bob Costas, told me. âThis time, there is not going to be a miracle.â"],["p","Tellingly, the hero of the 1994 SeleÃ§Ã£o, Romario, whose feet are sometimes credited with electing President Fernando Cardoso, has reÃ«merged as a leading voice of the World Cup opposition. âBrazil is hosting it, but itâs not for the Brazilian people,â Romario told me. âThe lower classes wonât be able to buy tickets.â Once known as a playboy, he is now a socialist congressman representing Rio de Janeiroâa Derek Jeter figure who recast himself as Muhammad Ali to seize the political moment."],["p","A considerable amount of the traditional Brazilian fixation with soccer, and with intellectualsâ embrace of Brazilian soccer as a global ideal, is bound up in the notion that Brazilians play not just better than everyone else but somehow differentlyâthat theyâd improved on a colonial import and made it their own. Whimsy and creativity exemplified by talents like PelÃ© and ManÃ© Garrincha, the so-called Angel with Bent Legs, are, according to this mythology, part of the national DNA, a product of the countryâs unique history of miscegenation. (Or a result, some argue, of black players having learned how to dance out of the way of onrushing whites in the days when even accidental body contact might have been interpreted as intolerable aggression.) This soccer-as-samba idealization, too, is largely a casualty of globalization. âBrazilians learned how to be technocrats, and Europeans learned how to be artists,â TostÃ£o, an integral member of perhaps the finest of all World Cup champions, the 1970 SeleÃ§Ã£o, said, and suggested that if I wanted to see the beautiful game now I might as well head to Barcelona or Manchester. Romario and his contemporaries may have had genius in their feet, as the saying goes, but the World Cups they won for Brazil, in 1994 and 2002, came after a long spell of elegant failure, and were triumphs of defensive tactics, not wizardryâa cynical concession, you might say. Sports fans, at heart, are not intellectuals but crass capitalists, who prefer winning at all costs. âPlaying beautifully and losing is horrible,â Luiz Felipe Scolari, the coach of the SeleÃ§Ã£o, told the ",["em","Times"]," recently. âWhoever says the opposite is an idiot.â"],["p","The problem is not just that so few members of the SeleÃ§Ã£o play professionally in Brazil but that the national team itself sometimes goes years without playing on home soil, instead touring the worldâlike the Harlem Globetrottersâto make money for the disreputable Brazilian Football Confederation, or C.B.F. Corruption is the essence of what the protesters are against, as they try to form a stable middle class, and the C.B.F. makes for a convenient villain. âI believe it will be the last corrupt organization to be extinguished,â Juca Kfouri, the countryâs most influential sportswriter, told me, and then brought up a video that Brazilians snicker about, in which JosÃ© Maria Marin, the head of the C.B.F., can be seen pocketing the medal of a junior player at an under-eighteen tournament. Marin succeeded Ricardo Teixeira, who resigned amid a bribery scandal. âIf Brazil wins the World Cup, well, good,â Kfouri added, and offered some tepid applause. âThe sixth time, O.K.? Itâs a banalization.

He was also one of the first to speak fluent English. The son of a prominent Brazilian surgeon, he did his graduate work at Vanderbilt and served as the chief economic adviser to JosÃ© Sarney, the first civilian President after the fall of Brazilâs twenty-one-year military dictatorship, in 1985. âOnce he decided to become a populist and do price freezing and all that crap that populists like to do, I moved away,â Rosenberg said."],["p","He spent two decades teaching and running a private consultancy, and then SÃ¡nchez approached him about taking the unusual leap into a business known for attracting rogues and crooks. âAndrÃ©s said, âLook, I know how to run a soccer club, but I donât have the faintest idea how to make money, so you come and do what you have to do,âÂ â Rosenberg said. âI already had all the money I needed, all the positions in Brazilâmy clients were all the large multinationalsâfantastic women, beautiful kids, the best cars, but I had never been a Latin-American champion. I didnât have a stadium!â He went on, âI had the opportunity in this backward environment to apply all the good liberal classical principles of pricing and marketing and all that.â It was as if Larry Summers had been summoned to rescue the Redskins from Dan Snyder."],["p","Rosenberg is sixty-nine, small, unassuming, and bald, with a neatly trimmed goatee, but he exhibits a boyish smile, with a trace of mischief, when he recounts the excitement of turning around the clubâs fortunes. (âRunning Corinthians must be comparable to running a whorehouse. What else can you ask from God?â) In 2007, amid allegations that Corinthians was being used as a front for money laundering by foreign investors, including the Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, the team performed so badly that it was demoted to Brazilâs B league, a crippling humiliation. SÃ¡nchez and Rosenberg took the reins, and within a year they had persuaded Ronaldo, the most prolific goal scorer in the history of the World Cup, and as outsized a figure as they come in contemporary Brazilian sportsâA-Rod and Big Papi at onceâto return home from Milan. Ronaldo was injured at the time and had grown overweight. âAnd he had been caught going to a motel with transvestites,â Rosenberg added. âSo, you know, it was like two drunkardsâthey lean against each other to stand up. That was the kind of agreement I proposed to him.â Corinthians, lacking the cash to offer Ronaldo a competitive salary, came up with a partnership, through which he could share in whatever sponsorship deals his star power brought the club."],["p","In addition to renewed success on the field, Ronaldo introduced glamour. Celebrities like Hugh Jackman and members of Coldplay started turning up at the stadium wearing Corinthiansâ black and white. Rosenbergâs singular achievement had been to brand the clubâs maniacal fan base as a kind of Red Sox Nation of the underclassâthe âPeopleâs Republic of Corinthians,â according to the Nike campaign, which marks the companyâs biggest-ever commitment to a South American club. The Corinthiano loyalty was such that thirty thousand supporters followed the team from Brazil to Nagoya and Yokohama for the Club World Cup last year, among them people who quit their jobs, divorced their wives, mortgaged their homes, and sold their refrigerators to make the pilgrimage."],["p","Corinthians now claims as many fans as Canada has citizens: thirty-five million. Rather than accept an equal share of television revenues, as custom dictated, Rosenberg and SÃ¡nchez threatened to stream Corinthians games online, for free, and thereby ushered in a system increasingly like Spainâs, or Major League Baseballâs, with a few high-earning clubs and a supporting cast of also-rans. Corinthians increased its annual revenues from Globo TV, Brazilâs monopolistic network, by threefold, and ",["em","Forbes"]," now values the club at more than a billion ",["em","reais"],"âthe first ten-figure Brazilian team. SÃ¡nchez predicted that within four years theyâd be among the three most valuable worldwide, rivalling Real Madrid and Manchester United, and talked idly about expanding into America, with a franchise in Major League Soccer."],["p","Rosenbergâs global-domination scheme extended to Asia. âEverybody knows that the real money is in China,â he said. âAnd, you know, Chineseâthey donât know shit about soccer.â Instead of scheduling a promotional tour through Shanghai and Beijing, the way some of the big European clubs have done, he conceived of a cultural exchange. âI have to think out of the box,â he said. Corinthians would develop a relationship with the Chinese soccer federation, lending medical and training support, and in return the Chinese would send him an athleteâa potential idol, a marketing sensation. âBecause Iâll have a billion Chinese say, âWhat? We donât know how to play soccer, and one of us is playing for the world champion!âÂ â he said. He asked the Corinthians coach, known as Tite, to scout Chinese prospects. âHe watched three hundred videos,â Rosenberg said. âAnd finally he came to me and said, âLook, this Zizao is not illiterate. We can make something out of him.â So I bought him.â Chen Zhizhao, or Zizao, as he is known in Brazil, arrived in SÃ£o Paulo in 2012 and was introduced at a press conference that featured women in silk dresses and dancing Chinese puppets. He was twenty-three years old, and had proven an effective goal scorer while playing for Shanghai Shenxin. âThen the bastard coach decided that this is interference, that he will lose face, that marketing decided to bring the player, that heâs not that good,â Rosenberg said, looking incredulous. âAnd he ",["em","benches"]," him! So I used the guy for social activitiesâto take gifts to the children in the hospital.â"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F593b5da71260cf20873dfd63%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b5da71260cf20873dfd63%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F593b5da71260cf20873dfd63%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b5da71260cf20873dfd63"}]],["p","This, too, was a novel concept: conspicuous social outreach. Corinthians donated money to combat obesity and Down syndrome and, after the 2011 tsunami, wore Japanese flags on their jerseys. They started planting a hundred trees on old SÃ£o Paulo brownfields for every goal the team scored. Eventually, they were winning often enough that they could claim to be among the worldâs first carbon-neutral soccer teams."],["p","Rosenberg stepped out on his balcony and contemplated the new stadium, which presented problems. For one thing, it was perhaps an hourâs drive from downtown. Itaquera, the scrappy neighborhood from which the stadium gets its nickname, has the densest concentration of Corinthians fans, and SÃ£o Paulo offered a large tax credit for construction projects in the area. But was it too far from the money? âThatâs the question I lose sleep over,â Rosenberg said. Also, there was the nagging issue of crowd violence, a cultural legacy that he hoped to suppress, not with moats and fences, in the familiar Third World fashion, but with twenty-first-century technology: facial-recognition software, bought from his new friends in China, that would automatically lock the turnstiles when known troublemakers

was founded by a group of railway workers in 1910, sixteen years after Charles Miller showed up in the port of Santos, outside SÃ£o Paulo, carrying a couple of balls that heâd picked up at school in Southampton, along with a set of rules for what to do with them. Soccer was just beginning to be more than a pastime of the urban Ã©lite, and the new clubâs founders took the name of a British team that had recently toured Brazil and handily beaten its aristocrats. For a few years, the workers played VÃ¡rzea, or floodplain football, before more established clubs deigned to accept their challenges. Gentlemanly play, albeit fraught with class aggression, gave way to professionalism in the nineteen-thirties, as a response to European poaching. Like coffee and sugar, soccer talent had become an exportable commodity. One Brazilian joke has it that the countryâs first World Cup title was won not in 1958, by PelÃ© and Garrincha, but in 1934, by Italy, which had repatriated its most talented South American emigrants."],["p","Clubs competed either for the Paulista or the Carioca championship, in SÃ£o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, respectively; a nationwide league wasnât established until 1959. This was the early period of what in Corinthians lore would come to be known as the droughtâa twenty-three-year stretch, from 1954 to 1977, in which Corinthians failed to win a championship, local or national. All great teams need a larger idea to elevate the endless strings of wins and losses, and for Corinthians fans the drought lent a sense of noble suffering that fit the time and the national mood. It coincided with a period of rapid urbanization, including an influx of immigrants to SÃ£o Paulo from the north, in search of low-wage jobs; their position as outsiders in the big city drew them to the big team with black-and-white jerseys who couldnât win. And, just as important, it overlapped with the military dictatorship that took power in 1964. Corinthiansâ failures and near-misses were a more realistic counterpoint to the mythology of the SeleÃ§Ã£o, which the generals exploited for political gain. The northern arrivistes sang darkly humorous folk songs about the plight of Corinthianos amid such hardship. Because of their outlander accents and stuttering laughter, Iâve heard it claimed that these fans were the first M.C.s."],["p","Historiansâor soccer historians, at any rateâidentify the so-called Corinthians Invasion, of Rio de Janeiro, in 1976, as the largest peacetime mobilization of a population anywhere. The occasion was a semifinal match at the MaracanÃ£ between Corinthians and Fluminense, an upper-class club with a dubious racial history. (Flu fans still scatter talcum powder at the start of games, in honor of their teamâs practice, a hundred years ago, of camouflaging a mixed-race player with whiteface.) Seventy thousand Corinthians diehards followed their heroes north, in a raucous caravan of jeeps and buses; in old film footage, they appear to be headed for Woodstock."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F593b5da80f529324ac06291e%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b5da80f529324ac06291e%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F593b5da80f529324ac06291e%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b5da80f529324ac06291e"}]],["p","The famous Brazilian clubs of that era were Santos (PelÃ©âs team) and Botafogo (Garrinchaâs), which toured the world and drew crowds almost as large as the SeleÃ§Ã£o. It wasnât until the early eighties, according to Juca Kfouri, that Corinthians really achieved national, and even global, relevance, by making explicit the clubâs opposition to the dictatorship. âIâm going to tell you a story for you to have a grasp,â Kfouri said. âTrotsky, when tired of all his work, asked for a vacation from his bossâfrom Leninâto go duck hunting in Siberia. There he caught pneumonia and became immobilized. At the same time, Lenin fell terminally ill in Moscow, and Trotsky watched as Stalin took over in a coup.â Kfouri, who had been slipping in and out of English and Portuguese, paused for a translation break, leaving me to marvel a little longer over the metaphorical power of ",["em","futebol"],", before the inevitable transition, which involved a Corinthians playersâ revolt led some thirty years ago by a brilliant Marxist midfielder named SÃ³crates, a âblack nationalistâ defender named Wladimir, and a rebellious teen-age forward known as Casagrande. Hardly catastrophic, like Stalinâs, their coup was a triumphâgrist for graduate theses on the political power of sport. But it, too, had its origins in the mundane: a lovesick Casagrandeâs request that he be allowed to leave a long road trip to visit his new girlfriend. The request was put to a vote. A kind of âbros before hosâ camaraderie prevailedâCasagrande agreed to remain and play onâand from this was born Corinthians Democracy, a movement that, in Kfouriâs estimation, âchanged the whole image of the club, and the perception of the fans toward it, for the rest of history, till this day.â"],["p","The players no longer took orders from management. They voted on everything, including when to stop the team bus for bathroom breaks and whom to invite for motivational lunch meetings before games. (SÃ³crates, who had studied to be a doctor and was bored by soccer talk, favored architects and musicians, and was said to play better when intellectually stimulated.) Their success on the field bought them some tolerance from SÃ£o Pauloâs professional class, which initially perceived them as anarchists and bearded Commies."],["p","A bit of strategic branding helped, too. That duty fell to Washington Olivetto, an advertising star and an almost Warholian figure who lent his nights and weekends to the teamâs marketing. Olivetto came up with a new jersey design, in which the word âDemocracÃ­aâ appeared on the back in black block letters above the playersâ numbers, along with a blood-spattered red âCorinthiana,â in the cursive style of Coca-Cola. The players werenât just hippies; they were culture warriorsâpop stars, even, who appeared onstage at a Rita Lee concert in SÃ£o Pauloâs Ibirapuera Park. As revolutionaries, Corinthians won back-to-back Paulista championships, in 1982 and 1983. âUntil that time, professional footballers were slaves,â Wladimir has said. Thereafter, Corinthians and their supporters were written into the plots of prime-time soap operas that rival soccer in popularity. Today, a bronze plaque greets players as they exit the weight room on their way to the practice fields. âNothing compares to the Corinthians in this land called Brazil,â it says, quoting SÃ³crates, and goes on to cite Karl Marx, Napoleon, the Dalai Lama, and Nelson Mandela as inspirations."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EWhen%20I%20arrived%20in%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%2C%20in%20October%2C%20Corinthians%2C%20like%20the%20Brazilian%20economy%2C%20were%20in%20a%20slump.%20%E2%80%9CMaybe%20it%E2%80%99s%20like%20when%20you%20finish%20having%20sex%2C%E2%80%9D%20Raul%20Correa%2C%20the%20club%E2%80%99s%20finance%20director%2C%20told%20me.%20He%20recounted%20a%20succession%20of%20titles%20the%20team%20had%20won%20in%20the%20past%20year%20and%20then%20feigned%20collapse%20from%20exhaustion.%20What%20was%20more%2C%20they%20were%20being%20punished%20for%20the%20behavior%20of%20some%20of%20their%20most%20committed%20fans%2C%20whose%20aggressive%20exuberance%20had%20led%20to%20a%20temporary%20ban%20on%20Corinthians%20games%20in%20the%20club%E2%80%99s%20home%20city.%20Instead%2C%20they%20were%20required%20to%20find%20playing%20accommodations%20beyond%20a%20hundred-kilometre%20radius%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%E2%80%94an%20inconvenience%20for%20the%20%3Cem%3Efiel%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20or%20faithful%2C%20as%20Corinthians%20loyalists%20call%20themselves%2C%20which%20was%20costing%20the%20club%20as%20much%20as%20twelve%20million%20dollars%20in%20lost%20revenues.%20They%20had%20a%20home%20game%20scheduled%20the%20first%20night%20I%20was%20in%20town%2C%20but%20it%20was%20actually%20going%20to%20be%20played%20in%20the%20small%20city%20of%20Mogi%20Mirim%2C%20at%20a%20stadium%20with%20lights%20on%20only%20one%20side%20of%20the%20field%2C%20so%20that%20the%20ball%20would%20be%20cast%20partly%20in%20shadow.%20The%20grass%20pitch%20was%20so%20uneven%20that%20the%20Corinthians%20captain%2C%20the%20graceful%20defender%20Paulo%20Andr%C3%A9%2C%20was%20taking%20the%20evening%20off%20as%20a%20precaution%20against%20injuries.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EI%20caught%20a%20ride%20to%20Mogi%20Mirim%20from%20Marcio%20Rosenberg%2C%20Luis%20Paulo%E2%80%99s%20son.%20Marcio%2C%20who%20is%20thirty-six%2C%20grew%20up%20partly%20in%20New%20York%20and%20Washington%2C%20D.C.%2C%20where%20his%20mother%20worked%20at%20the%20World%20Bank%2C%20so%20he%20was%20an%20especially%20helpful%20cultural%20translator%20as%20we%20fought%20our%20way%20north%20through%20traffic%20that%20reminded%20me%20of%20the%20Thanksgiving%20rush%20to%20J.F.K.%20%E2%80%9CExperts%20are%20calculating%20that%20in%20twenty%20years%20the%20traffic%20will%20stop%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CIt%20will%20not%20even%20be%20slow.%20The%20cars%20simply%20won%E2%80%99t%20move.%E2%80%9D%20Marcio%20was%20driving%20an%20armored%20car%E2%80%94a%20souped-up%20black%20VW%20Beetle%E2%80%94and%20struggling%20to%20find%20a%20signal%20strong%20enough%20to%20operate%20the%20G.P.S.%20on%20his%20iPhone.%20Among%20the%20many%20promises%20politicians%20and%20business%20leaders%20have%20made%20in%20the%20run-up%20to%20the%20World%20Cup%20is%20to%20revamp%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20antiquated%20telecommunications%20network.%20We%20missed%20a%20crucial%20highway%20exit%2C%20causing%20Marcio%20to%20yearn%20for%20his%20old%20jeep%2C%20with%20which%20he%E2%80%99d%20have%20made%20up%20for%20lost%20time%20by%20off-roading%20across%20a%20hilly%20median.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20trip%20took%20nearly%20three%20hours%E2%80%94long%20enough%20for%20Rosenberg%20to%20fill%20me%20in%20on%20the%20club%E2%80%99s%20disciplinary%20predicament.%20The%20trouble%20began%20last%20February%2C%20with%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20tragedy%20in%20Bolivia%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20Corinthians%20fans%20were%20setting%20off%20fireworks%20inside%20a%20stadium%20in%20Oruro%2C%20and%20an%20errant%E2%80%94or%20weaponized%E2%80%94flare%20struck%20a%20fourteen-year-old%20Bolivian%20boy%20in%20the%20eye%2C%20killing%20him.%20Unable%20to%20identify%20a%20lone%20assailant%20amid%20the%20chaos%2C%20the%20Bolivian%20authorities%20detained%20a%20dozen%20members%20of%20Gavi%C3%B5es%20da%20Fiel%2C%20or%20Hawks%20of%20the%20Faithful%2C%20the%20largest%20Corinthians%20booster%20organization%2C%20sparking%20a%20diplomatic%20incident%20that%20rose%20to%20the%20level%20of%20hostage%20negotiations.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWeeks%20of%20imprisonment%20turned%20into%20months.%20No%20evidence%20was%20produced%2C%20no%20charges%20filed.%20The%20Hawks%20are%20the%20oldest%20and%20best%20known%20of%20Brazil%E2%80%99s%20%3Cem%3Etorcidas%20organizadas%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20and%20politically%20powerful%2C%20with%20nearly%20a%20hundred%20thousand%20dues-paying%20members%20and%20a%20reputation%20for%20using%20intimidation%20to%20get%20what%20they%20want%E2%80%94the%20Teamsters%20of%20the%20pitch.%20Shortly%20after%20the%20incident%2C%20a%20seventeen-year-old%20boy%20confessed.%20(He%20was%20safely%20back%20in%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20and%20conveniently%20ineligible%20for%20extradition%2C%20owing%20to%20his%20status%20as%20a%20minor.)%20Meanwhile%2C%20Dilma%20Rousseff%20dispatched%20an%20aide%20to%20plead%20directly%20with%20the%20Bolivian%20President%2C%20Evo%20Morales%2C%20for%20the%20release%20of%20the%20incarcera

I arrived in SÃ£o Paulo, in October, Corinthians, like the Brazilian economy, were in a slump. âMaybe itâs like when you finish having sex,â Raul Correa, the clubâs finance director, told me. He recounted a succession of titles the team had won in the past year and then feigned collapse from exhaustion. What was more, they were being punished for the behavior of some of their most committed fans, whose aggressive exuberance had led to a temporary ban on Corinthians games in the clubâs home city. Instead, they were required to find playing accommodations beyond a hundred-kilometre radius of SÃ£o Pauloâan inconvenience for the ",["em","fiel"],", or faithful, as Corinthians loyalists call themselves, which was costing the club as much as twelve million dollars in lost revenues. They had a home game scheduled the first night I was in town, but it was actually going to be played in the small city of Mogi Mirim, at a stadium with lights on only one side of the field, so that the ball would be cast partly in shadow. The grass pitch was so uneven that the Corinthians captain, the graceful defender Paulo AndrÃ©, was taking the evening off as a precaution against injuries."],["p","I caught a ride to Mogi Mirim from Marcio Rosenberg, Luis Pauloâs son. Marcio, who is thirty-six, grew up partly in New York and Washington, D.C., where his mother worked at the World Bank, so he was an especially helpful cultural translator as we fought our way north through traffic that reminded me of the Thanksgiving rush to J.F.K. âExperts are calculating that in twenty years the traffic will stop,â he said. âIt will not even be slow. The cars simply wonât move.â Marcio was driving an armored carâa souped-up black VW Beetleâand struggling to find a signal strong enough to operate the G.P.S. on his iPhone. Among the many promises politicians and business leaders have made in the run-up to the World Cup is to revamp the countryâs antiquated telecommunications network. We missed a crucial highway exit, causing Marcio to yearn for his old jeep, with which heâd have made up for lost time by off-roading across a hilly median."],["p","The trip took nearly three hoursâlong enough for Rosenberg to fill me in on the clubâs disciplinary predicament. The trouble began last February, with âthe tragedy in Bolivia,â he said. Corinthians fans were setting off fireworks inside a stadium in Oruro, and an errantâor weaponizedâflare struck a fourteen-year-old Bolivian boy in the eye, killing him. Unable to identify a lone assailant amid the chaos, the Bolivian authorities detained a dozen members of GaviÃµes da Fiel, or Hawks of the Faithful, the largest Corinthians booster organization, sparking a diplomatic incident that rose to the level of hostage negotiations."],["p","Weeks of imprisonment turned into months. No evidence was produced, no charges filed.

It had become harder to view the ex-prisoners as martyrs for the Corinthiansâ populist cause, and Rosenberg now contended that the real hostages were the teamâs players and the silent majority of

The Wednesday games donât begin until 10 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"P"],".",["em",{"class":"small"},"M"],".âafter the ",["em","telenovelas"],". The Metro shuts down at midnight. The conditions donât favor family excursions to the local stadium. âThey say we have the ugliest fans,â Rosenberg said, as he escorted me through a crowd that appeared to have few middle-class representatives. âUnfortunately, theyâre right.â We found space to stand in a corner of the stadium, which was built in the concrete brutalist style for a team in Brazilâs C league, and were surprised to hear someone speaking English behind us, comparing the size of the capacity crowd, of around twenty thousand, to that of a college basketball game in the United States. His name was Ron, and he was from Ohio: late twenties, blond goatee. He had married a Brazilian woman and followed her home to Mogi Mirim. She worked for I.B.M., while he taught English. âThatâs why I like college ",["em","football"],", bro,â he said to his Brazilian friend, implying that this spectacle was seriously lacking, by comparison. âYou got to come with me to the States.â"],["p","The fans displayed banners from GaviÃµes and smaller guilds, with names like Estopim (Fuel) and PavilhÃ£o 9âa reference to the cellblock where a famous prison riot took place in 1992. An ominous barbed-wire fence encircled the grass. Rosenberg began pointing out some of Corinthiansâ key players. There was Ralf, âa guard dog,â and Douglas, âthe maestro, the guy with the light touch,â as well as Emerson, who is better known as Sheik, because he played for several years in Qatar. None of these names appeared on the backs of the supportersâ shirts. That honor was reserved for Ronaldo, who retired in 2011. âHe was fat, he was smoking, he was drinkingâhe was sort of Corinthians!â Rosenberg said, explaining the lasting appeal, in contrast with the relative unpopularity of Alexandre Pato, a twenty-four-year-old sniper and the teamâs current leading scorer, who was in South Korea at the moment, touring with the SeleÃ§Ã£o. Pato had also been wooed back from Milan and was in some ways a more significant acquisition: a rare instance of a Brazilian club outbidding the Europeans for a player in his prime. But Pato, Rosenberg said, had grown up as âa rich kid,â and the fans remained wary."],["p","Corinthians do not play the beautiful game. Tite, the coach, had come from the south of Brazil, where a defensive posture is favored, as in Uruguay, across the border. This cautiousness, I gathered, sometimes confounded the ",["em","fielâs"]," expectations of aggressive running, as proof of constant effortâa blue-collar style for a blue-collar team. I began to detect some restlessness: groans amid the synchronized chants. âSome of our fans donât like it when the ball goes backward,â Rosenberg explained. âThey only want forward.â Yet Corinthians supporters pride themselves on never booing their players during games, a tradition that is enforced by the Hawks, and this, like the lack of a large scoreboard with a clock on it, was an aspect of the local sporting culture that our new American friend couldnât abide. âI hate clapping for shitty shots,â Ron said, when a ball sailed wide of the goal, spurring a brief revival of intensity to the chanting. The American tendency to confuse scoreless soccer for an absence of action is often ridiculedârightlyâby connoisseurs, but on this night it was hard to escape the conclusion that nothing much was happening."],["p","Ron left early (he had to get up to teach in the morning), and a more universal theme emerged: complaining about the officiating. The long-suffering Corinthianos have a reputation for feeling especially aggrieved on this count, and the fact that they now represent the establishment didnât seem to have reassured them. âThe ref, he thinks this is ",["em","ballet"],",â Rosenberg complained, after a yellow card was issued to a Corinthians defender.

During an altercation on the field, the referee, who was twenty, took out a knife and stabbed one of the players. The playerâs friends and family retaliated by quartering and decapitating the ref and running motorcycles over his limbless torso. Rosenberg knew about the incident, and had seen the YouTube video of clinicians at the morgue reattaching the severed head. âIt was bound to happen one day,â he said, half joking.

One guy, a young tech consultant, Googled the incident on his phone and turned ashen. He was surprised, he said, to realize that foreigners must âlook at us the way we look at China.â Others merely rolled their eyes at the persistence of a tabloid trope. âThat was only news in London and New York,â a journalist named Mauricio Savarese explained. âBecause, in the inimitable words of the ",["em","Guardian"],", it âraises concerns about the World Cup.âââ From his perspective, it raised concerns only about the way the international media were likely to cover the World Cup. The killing was a function of rural poverty, of which Brazil still has plenty, and it had little to do with soccer. One of Savareseâs friends asked me what it would say about Americaâs supposed national pastime if an amateur baseball player in a remote part of the country were to turn up dead, the victim of a random heinous crime. Without much Googling effort, I was able to find a news story about a twenty-three-year-old baseball player recently killed in Oklahoma by three teen-agers, who explained that they had been bored."],["p","Savarese and his friends argued that Brazilâs soccer culture was less violent than Argentinaâs, and noted that the local corruption problem wasnât anywhere near as bad as in Russia, where fifty billion dollars has already been blown on preparations for the Winter Games in Sochiâas much as Brazil expects to spend for the World Cup and the 2016 Summer Games combined."],["p","The more interesting problem, they said, was that Brazilâs domestic soccer league was suffering from arrested development, and seemed to be thriving and foundering simultaneously. Clubs were earning record revenues, from television rights and gate receiptsâa result of price increases to offset the debts from new stadium construction, in some cases. But ticket prices had also risen in excess of demand, and live attendanceâthe fervor of Corinthianos notwithstandingâwas dwindling. The average crowd in the Brazilian A league numbered around thirteen thousand, below that of Major League Soccer in the United States, where the sport rarely makes headlines. The game in Mogi Mirim, everyone agreed, had been lousy, but, in a general sense, so had the entire seasonâthe least compelling in recent memory.

with their newfound revenue streams, Corinthians spent twenty million dollars in 2010 building a lavish new training complex near the airport. It has indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis courts, a private thirty-two-room hotel, Foosball tables, a music-listening room, a barbecue pit, poker tablesâand even some soccer fields. âFootballers are not mature enough to behave themselves before games without anyone supervising them,â Luiz Felipe Scolari, the SeleÃ§Ã£o coach, once told Alex Bellos, justifying the Brazilian concept of ",["em","concentraÃ§Ã£o"]," (concentration), which calls for players to be sequestered, sometimes for days, before big matches. âItâs been proved that sex before a game isnât bad for you,â the coach acknowledged. âBut, for our players, they donât do things by halves.â"],["p","âItâs the opposite of empowering,â Paulo AndrÃ©, the Corinthians captain, complained before practice one day. âIt takes away from your ability to grow as an individual, and make your own decisions, and know the difference between right and wrong. Because here everything is provided for you. You just breathe and walk. So when you go home youâre basically a little bit lost.â Paulo AndrÃ© is thirty, tall and lean, with tousled brown hair and contemplatively cultivated stubbleâthe intellectual of Brazilian soccer. âI wrote a book in nine months, three hours every day, during concentration,â he said. âIâve watched every single TV series that there is.â He paints, too: abstract expressionism with a recurring soccer-cleat theme. âI find inspiration in many things,â he said. âSometimes I just have a bottle of wine and go crazy.â"],["p","Like other forms of paternalism, ",["em","concentraÃ§Ã£o"]," has its virtues: it protects the players from their fans. But when the Hawks are especially unhappy they storm the gates of the training complex. Paulo AndrÃ© brought up an incident in 2011, after Corinthians were unexpectedly eliminated from the Copa Libertadores, South Americaâs most prestigious tournament, by Tolima, a little-known Colombian team. He called it âour worst day.â Fans smashed car windows in the playersâ parking lot and occupied the grounds for twenty-four hours. Paulo AndrÃ© was moved to write an essay, âTrue Love,â that he posted to his personal blog. âI think the truly passionate love the club unselfishly, without demanding anything in return, like the feeling of a father for a son or a man for his wife,â it said, and went on to wonder why the teamâs frustrated fans couldnât direct their reformist convictions toward civic activism (âEducation, public transportation, slumsâ) and âstop depositing all their joy and hope in the teams they love.â Before posting it, he sent the statement to SÃ³crates, the hero of the Corinthian playersâ revolt thirty years earlier. âYouâre fully right in your words,ââ SÃ³crates told him. âMy only critique is to keep in mind that the fans, theyâre extremely emotional. They love this team above all, and even above reason.â"],["p","The popular success of the June protests had emboldened the players to speak out politically, with mixed results. Sheik, for example, had recently invited controversy by dabbling in Instagram activism, posting a picture in which he and his male business partner posed smooching across a table in a restaurant they own, in Rio de Janeiro. Intended as an expression of support for gay marriage, the image incensed the Hawks, who feared ridicule from rival teamsâ supporters, and Sheik, who is not gay, was compelled to apologize in person to the Hawksâ leadership for the distraction."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F593b5daf20855957e69d52c9%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b5daf20855957e69d52c9%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F593b5daf20855957e69d52c9%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b5daf20855957e69d52c9"}]],["p","âThe protests showed us that there is a forum to call for change,â Paulo AndrÃ© said. âBut we are a little bit afraid, because we go up against the clubs and the fans, who have this mind-set that we are racehorses who serve only one purpose: run after the ball.â Having learned from his past missteps, he had chosen to wage a more technical battle for playersâ rights, by focussing on âthe calendar.â Brazilians, he argued, play too many gamesâas many as eighty-five per year, compared with fifty or sixty in Europe. They donât break for international tournaments, leaving clubs shorthanded in crucial matches. Their winter vacation is too short. They have to wait for ",["em","telenovelas"]," to end. Framed the right way, it was more than a conventional labor dispute; it was an argument for rescuing the Brazilian game from mediocrity."],["p","As SÃ³crates and the democratic revolutionaries had done decades earlier, Paulo AndrÃ© enlisted the help of Washington Olivetto, the adman, who allowed the captains of all twenty A-league teams to meet secretly in the SÃ£o Paulo offices of the international firm WMcCann, of which Olivetto is chairman. âItâs a historic event!â Paulo AndrÃ© said. âThe first time we were able to unite twenty players from different clubs in one place to talk about issues like these.

going to get there and realize youâre covering the wrong team,â Marcio Rosenbergâs girlfriend, Andrea, told me, as she prepared to drop us off outside SÃ£o Pauloâs biggest stadium, in the wealthy, hilly neighborhood of Morumbi. âYouâll see all the beautiful people, with actual teeth, who can say the alphabet.â She was referring to the fans of SÃ£o Paulo Football Club, the team of the cityâs Ã©lite, and Corinthiansâ next opponent. A match between Corinthians and SÃ£o Paulo is called a ClÃ¡ssico Majestoso and invariably draws big crowds, in this case fifty thousand."],["p","We watched the first half from what had passed for a luxury box when the stadium was built, a half century ago, and I could immediately see why World Cup games in SÃ£o Paulo would be hosted elsewhere: the seats were recessed so far underneath the upper deck that oneâs view was reduced to the perimeter of the field and little else. The effect was of watching on television, without any of the panning shots that capture the thrilling pageantry of the spectators. Youâd never be able to extort corporate sponsorsâ executives for tens of thousands of dollars to watch Croatia play South Korea from such a bunker."],["p","The box was glassed in, but I could occasionally make out the thrust of the SÃ£o Paulo fansâ taunts. These were aimed at Sheik, the Instagrammer, and resumed whenever he touched the ball: â",["em","Sheik, veado! Sheik, veado!"],"â (âSheik, queer!â) Later, after Sheik sprang loose for a breakaway and pushed the ball just wide of the goalmouth with the outside of his right foot, they began a new chant, which Rosenberg translated for me as âKiss him, kiss him.â After years of being called Bambis by thuggish Corinthianos, the SÃ£o Paulistas were exulting in their easy opportunity for revenge."],["p","Had we stayed in the bunker, Iâd have missed the real news of the game (which would end, like the one in Mogi Mirim, without any goals for either side). But, feeling claustrophobic, we took a walk at halftime and were standing in an aisle, across the field from the ",["em","organizadas"]," with their drums and banners, when a couple of deafening booms shook the stadium foundation, followed by dissipating clouds of smoke. The two sides, separated by a barricade and a column of gray-uniformed policemen, were lobbing explosives at one another."],["p","SÃ£o Paulo F.C. may be the team of the Ã©lite, and Morumbi the equivalent of Beverly Hills, but ParaisÃ³polis, an enormous favela, sits in the middle of the neighborhood and provides a ready supply of the sort of disaffected masculinity that drives hooliganism. âWe want GaviÃµes! We want GaviÃµes!â the men of Independente, SÃ£o Pauloâs counterparts to the Hawks, chanted. âWe want to kill you again, you sons of bitches. Come again, so we can fuck you up!â But one of the explosives, thrown from the Independente side, had fallen short of its mark and landed near the police. They charged and began battering the home teamâs fans with nightsticks. The crowd fought back, kicking and punching. Soda grenades were pitched from above. (Alcohol is forbidden in Brazilian stadiums.) From a distance, the violence looked almost theatrical, ritualisticâas, in some ways, it was. Several hours later, buses carrying fans from the rival groups intersected at a location that had been arranged on the Internet, and fighting resumed, with scissors, rocks, and iron rods. This time, police set off the bombs, and fired rubber bullets to subdue the thugs.

fight at Morumbi, I kept hearing, was sadly typical, and a reason that more casual fans had stopped going to the stadiums, content to watch on television. But, coming as it did in the wake of Bolivia and BrasÃ­lia, it generated enough negative attention that local politicians began calling for the Hawks to be âextinguishedââdisbanded by law. Davi Gebara, the groupâs official lawyer, smelled an international conspiracy, an extension of the favela âpacificationâ going on in Rio de Janeiro, in anticipation of the World Cup and the Olympics. âTheyâre trying to close the ",["em","organizadas"]," only for the sake of appearances abroad,â he told me, through an interpreter, and said that pressure from ",["em",{"class":"small"},"FIFA"]," was making his job harder and soccer less fun. âEvery tree has its rotten roots,â he said. âBut the good things happen because the organized groups are there, because they sing and cheer the team on. Who else brings the drums?â He believed that it was the governmentâs responsibility to manage the bus routes to and from the stadiums, so as to prevent conflict. He suggested blocking certain streets and highways on game days. (This, of course, would only compound the traffic problem.)"],["p","Brazilâs ",["em","torcidas organizadas"]," originated as a decentralizing political movement, in the late nineteen-sixties and seventies, during the dictatorship, and reflected a broader frustration with the establishment, including the management of individual clubs. The fans demanded accountability, but they were also, in some cases, a force for social progress, advocating on behalf of the landless class and donating blood. Raul Correa, the Corinthians finance director, proudly showed me his first GaviÃµes da Fiel membership card, which identified him as the eleventh person ever to join, in 1969. He was then a teen-ager. AndrÃ©s SÃ¡nchez, the former Corinthians president, was one of the founders of PavilhÃ£o 9. But in recent decades the ",["em","organizadas"]," had grown pathologicalâlike British hooligan âfirmsâ and Italian âultras,â only without the white supremacy."],["p","Several years ago, in an effort to control crowd violence, the C.B.F. instituted a rule that limited visiting teamsâ fans to ten per cent of the audience at any given stadium. The idea was that such a lopsided ratio would dissuade pesky visitors from picking fights with their hosts, and insure that the home teamâs fans never felt upstaged or outclassed. Instead, it placed an artificial premium on the visitorsâ tickets and gave more power to the likes of the Hawks, who could buy in bulk and extort the clubs for discounts while they were at it. âTeams give away tickets to these hoodlums,â TostÃ£o, the ex-idol, who is now a revered newspaper columnist, said. âWe are at risk of ",["em","only"]," these guys going to the games.â"],["p","Luis Paulo Rosenberg was more sympathetic. âThe share of Corinthians in their total life is much larger than in ours,â he said of the Hawks, and estimated that âfor them, Corinthians must represent ninety per cent, fucking eight per cent, and eating two. Thatâs about the priority scale. And mine? Corinthians is only fifty. Iâm a very normal person.â Rosenberg preferred to think of the over-all Corinthians experience as a product to be sold, like an iPhone, and the action on the field was only one component. In this, he and Gebara, the lawyer, were kindred spirits. âThe players, they provide the video of the spectacle, and the GaviÃµes, they provide the audio,â Rosenberg said. âSo itâs fair that they should get a discount. They are there to work.â"],["p","âOf course, they make some crazy suggestionsâthat I should, for instance, reduce tickets by half,â Rosenberg went on, and explained that he had raised tickets for V.I.P.s by three hundred per cent to try to keep prices affordable on the lower end. âThey are trying to convince me, âImagine if the Pope decides to charge for someone to enter into a Mass,âÂ â he said. âThey say, âYou are doing the same! We have to attend the game!âÂ â"],["p","Rosenberg also credited the Hawks with having influenced the teamâs uniform design for the better. In imitation of the SeleÃ§Ã£o, whose jerseys display five stars on the chest, one for each World Cup title, Corinthians had begun adding stars to their logo, to reflect each national championship. âOne of the guys from GaviÃµes comes to me and says, âLuis Paulo, get the fucking stars out,â â he recalled. âI said, âWhat are you talking about? You know how much it cost us to get those stars? Why would you ask me to remove them?â He said, âBecause Nike has a fixed space for the whole logo, so, as we are going to win and win, each time the emblem is getting smaller to make room for stars.

Gebara invited me to watch the next game on TV with him and some of the Hawksâ leaders, and wrote down the address of a bar. My interpreter declined to accompany me. âI donât think it would be in my best interest,â he said. He had already admitted to Gebara, offhand, that he supports Palmeiras, another SÃ£o Paulo club, which is traditionally associated with the cityâs Italian community. Then, perhaps two hours before game time, I received an e-mail from Gebaraâs wife, saying that Gebara, too, was begging off. I showed up anyway, having already arranged to meet another interpreterâa Corinthiano. His name was Daniel (Iâll spare him the trouble of identifying him further), and he brought along some friends, who shared pictures and stories with me from their trip to Japan, until two of them apologized and abruptly stood up to leave, saying that they had prior commitments. The Hawksâ heavies had arrived."],["p","There was a precondition to our joining their table: they werenât interested in talking about violence. A couple of them eventually produced business cards. They were Wagner da Costa, a.k.a. B.O., the president, and Rodrigo Fonseca, a.k.a. Diguinho, the vice-president. (Elections are held every two years.) I recognized their names from a news story about an ongoing investigation into the deaths of three Palmeiras fans, in which they were described as suspects. (They were never charged.) Another man, who had a bemused affect, introduced himself briefly and then ceased participating in the conversation. Daniel later told me that this man had a northern accent, and he thought he recognized him as one of the leaders of an ",["em","organizada"]," that supports Botafogo, in Rio de Janeiro. He found this apparent friendship among purported rivals puzzlingâdisillusioning, even. We prefer our hoodlums pure."],["p","Da Costa, who is black, sat facing the front door, with his back to the television. He had on a Calvin Klein T-shirt, jeans, and a backward-facing blue cap pulled down to his brow. Fonseca, who is white, wore a black hoodie and monitored the game on the screen, which was taking place in Porto Alegre, in the south. They had originally intended to goâsixteen hours by bus. But the politics surrounding the proposed extinguishing had made them cautious. âThe government is trying to show the world something thatâs not really our culture,â Fonseca said. âAll the problems we have in soccer are not so different from the problems we have in education and health. They are trying to show that we have a country much better than we really have.â He gestured at the screen. âFor example, you see the stadium tonightâitâs empty. The cheapest ticket for this game was eighty ",["em","reais"],"ââthirty-five dollars. âThatâs too expensive for one simple game during the week.â"],["p","Waiters kept bringing beer and plates of food to the table; Daniel told me he was under the impression that the service was complimentary. âSometimes I feel like the mayor of a small city,â da Costa said, and mentioned that his responsibilities extended beyond soccer. The Hawks had long since diversified and now ran one of the countryâs largest samba schools, to compete in the Carnaval parade. (This yearâs show will honor Ronaldo; last yearâs honored Washington Olivetto.) Da Costa said that he was born in 1983, at the peak of the Corinthians Democracy movement, but that he was too young to have felt its power as a source of personal pride. His politics were distinctly Corinthiano. (During the June protests, the Hawks rushed to the ItaquerÃ£o construction site to defend it from vandals.)"],["p","As we were speaking, Fonseca suddenly threw his phone on the floor. Corinthiansâ opponents had scored. âThe players are not lazy,â he said, shaking his head. âBut they donât have the same willingness nowadays.â"],["p","Daniel told me that it wouldnât be

SÃ¡nchez, who was contemplating a campaign for president of the C.B.F., based on the strength of his record reforming Corinthians, visited the club headquarters at the Parque SÃ£o Jorge, and offered some advice to his successor, Mario Gobbi. âSouth American football is a complicated business,â he said. âIf youâre not pushing a rod up someoneâs ass every day, itâs time to move on.â He meant this to be understood about Tite, who had been with the team for four seasons, a nearly unheard-of tenure for a coach. This had been another source of Corinthians pride, the patience to trust in a system of competent management without reacting hastily. But the team had now been held scoreless in ten of its last twelve games. With so few trees to plant, Corinthiansâ vaunted carbon-neutrality seemed in jeopardy. SÃ¡nchez said that he expected a kvetching phone call from Lula at any moment. (Titeâs contract wasnât renewed.) He wondered about Paulo AndrÃ©, too. âAsk Paulo AndrÃ© if heâs a painter, a cinematographer, an intellectual, or a soccer player,â he said. âBecause something tells me you canât be all.â"],["p","Marcio Rosenberg offered me another lift in his armored car, this time to visit the new stadium, which was said to be nearly finished, in time for a âsoftâ opening in January, when an exhibition game was planned. âWith traffic, this is almost as far away as Mogi Mirim,â he warned, as we headed east away from the TiÃªte River, which is so heavily polluted in places that its surface produces suds. âSomeday, that river will be clean, and weâll be sitting on the best address in Brazil,â Rosenberg said. âThe world is looking at us, worried, like, âIf these little guys ever bind together and get serious, weâre fucked.âÂ â"],["p","Recent news offered an alternativeâless optimisticâinterpretation. The protests were picking up again, led now by a smaller, more militant group, the anarchist Black Bloc, who had smashed shopwindows and set fires in Rio and SÃ£o Paulo, in support of striking teachers. More tabloid fodder, meanwhile, had just landed on the Drudge Report: First Capital Command, a big prison gang, let it be known that it planned to initiate a âWorld Cup of Terrorâ for tourists, unless the authorities ceased putting gang leaders in solitary confinement, in preparation for the June games. âThatâs why weâre getting out of Dodge,â Rosenberg said, and mentioned that heâd had to disappoint his American friends whoâd been calling in the hope that he might score them some tickets. âI donât even want to be close to this place when all hell breaks loose.â"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F593b5db3ba20a654ac5d430c%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b5db3ba20a654ac5d430c%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F593b5db3ba20a654ac5d430c%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b5db3ba20a654ac5d430c"}]],["p","The drive left skyscrapers behind and took us deeper into the blighted east zone, where graffiti and trash predominated. As we ascended a hill, at last, toward the giant stadium, there were men in yellow jackets everywhere, busily converting the muddy slopes into a greenbelt. We were made to put on hard hats and boots before entering the grounds. The worldâs largest screen was not yet lit, but its white panels faced out as we approached, and Rosenberg called my attention to the galvanized steel girders that were holding it up. They were also white and had been painted in such a way that they wouldnât turn rust-colored, lest anyone confuse the color scheme with that of a rival. Three tanks from Petrobras, the gas company, loomed over the bleachers; their pipelines had been rerouted around the stadium at a cost of about thirty million ",["em","reais"],". âThereâs not even going to be room for mosquitoes, weâre going to pack it so full,â Rosenberg said, as we sat in the front row and enjoyed the feeling of unfettered proximity to the pitch. âThe grass is ready,â he noted."],["p","In the weeks that followed, the slump persisted before it abated. Pato missed a penalty kick; when the Corinthians bus arrived for a game in the port of Santos, a few days later, angry âsupportersâ were waiting with rocks and beer cans. They pelted both teamsâ buses, one out of pique and the other for good measure, delaying the start of the game as officials cleaned up the mess. âThis is absurd,â a Santos executive said. âWe were targeted by ",["em","animals"],". We should be playing with closed gates, without fans.â"],["p","Zizaoâs contract was up, like that of the coach who wouldnât let him play, and heâd soon be headed back to China. The Bom Senso F.C. was growing in strength, from seventy-five members, when I first spoke with Paulo AndrÃ©, to more than a thousandâa global commune in support of soccer playersâ rights. Across the league, the players began locking arms at the start of games and refusing for several minutes to kick the ball.

I never want to tell stories about my children, because it always seems a little lazy. Children tend to be sort of dumb, and, in the end, the stories are always the same: children say hilarious things, and I am old and dying."],["p","So when I tell you these stories about my children letâs just pretend they are about my cats."],["p","So my cats and I were watching âDownton Abbeyâ last year. (I have two cats, one girl cat, who is twelveâin cat years, obviouslyâand a boy cat, who is seven.) And at one point my younger cat turned to me and said, âWhat is that human woman trying to say to that other man?â"],["p","And I said, âThat is Mary Crawley. She is trying to tell Matthew that she is in love with him.â"],["p","And my younger cat thought about it and said, âWell, that is a very hard thing to do.â And then he said, âYou have to pick ",["em","just"]," the right time.â"],["p","Then my older cat turned to him and said, â",["em",{"class":"small"},"WILL YOU BE QUIET"],", ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PLEASE"],"?â"],["p","Hereâs another story."],["p","I was watching âDownton Abbeyâ with my cats, and in one episode Anna (a human on the show) tells her fiancÃ©, Mr. Bates, not to worry about her, because she is âa trouper.â"],["p","And my younger cat turned to me and said, âWhatâs a âtrouperâ?â"],["p","I had to think about it. I explained to my younger cat that a trouper is someone who has a job that isnât easy or fair, and he doesnât want to do it, but he is going to do it anyway."],["p","And then a long time passedâwhole scenes of âDownton Abbeyâ strolled elegantly byâbefore my younger cat said quietly, to himself, âSometimes I am a trouper.â"],["p","Adorable, right? Cats say the darnedest things."],["p","And then my older cat told my younger cat, â",["em",{"class":"small"},"BE QUIET"],", ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ALREADY"],",â and suggested that he not watch the show until he is intelligent enough to understand it."],["p","My older cat hates it when my younger cat watches âDownton Abbeyâ with us, because watching âDownton Abbeyâ makes her feel grownup, and his presence robs her of this illusion. This occasionally makes her very cruel."],["p","One time when I was watching âDownton Abbeyâ with my cats, and they were bickering, I told her, âYou better watch out. Youâre starting to act a little like Mary Crawley.â Which is to say: like a bitch. Now, this is not something you could ever say to a child, but when you say it to a cat itâs hilarious, because it is literally ironic."],["p","And she said, âI know, Iâm sorry.â And I realized that watching âDownton Abbeyâ with my cats allowed me to speak more plainly with my cats than ever before."],["p","One night while watching âDownton Abbeyâ with my cats, I had a profound experience of dÃ©jÃ  vu. I suddenly had this flash memory of myself, as a child, when I used to watch the PBS show âUpstairs, Downstairsâ with my cats."],["p","(Of course, in this case, and this case only, when I say âmy catsâ that is a euphemism for âmy parents.â)"],["p","I am an only child. And when you are an only child you have an unusual relationship with your parents. There are only the three of you, and you come to rely on one another for company as much as for anything else. You spend a lot of time travelling together, going to movies together, and watching public television together, with your dinner in your lap. Your mother and father are not so much your parents as they are your weird, older roommates. Or, better, a pair of older cats who wander in and out of the rooms of your house. They silently judge you, but they canât stop you from whatever it is youâre going to do."],["p","You would think that this sudden memory of watching âUpstairs, Downstairsâ with my cats would have been comfortingâto know that this tradition of watching British period drama together would be passed down from generation to generation, from cat to son to cat."],["p","But it was not comforting. It was horrible."],["p","Because it made me realize that âDownton Abbeyâ and âUpstairs, Downstairsâ are the same thing. They are the exact same television show: about an aristocratic family living through the early twentieth century, their lives entwined with those of a plucky, makeshift family of servants below them. First World War. Love. Troupers. All of it the same."],["p","And it made me understand: no matter what you do or make in life, it will be forgotten. And then people will just make it again and pretend that what you did never happened."],["p","And, just as in any story about your cats, I realized that the subtext is: Cats are hilarious and I am dying, I am dying, I am dying.

I was almost twenty-five but, by other measures, much younger. I shed those names just as the bus crossed into Uganda. I was nearing Lake Victoria; I knew Kampala was somewhere close, but even then I had committed myself to thinking of it as âthe capital.â The name Kampala was too small for what I imagined. That city belonged to Uganda, but the capital had no such allegiances. Like me, it belonged to no one, and anyone could claim it."],["p","I spent my first few weeks trying to imitate the gangs of boys who lingered around the university and outside the cafÃ©s and bars that bordered it. Though we couldnât afford to take classes, we all wanted to be revolutionaries. On campus, and even in the poor quarters where Isaac and I lived, there were dozens of Lumumbas, Marleys, Malcolms, CÃ©saires, Kenyattas, Senghors, and Selassies, boys who woke up every morning and donned the black hats and olive-green costumes of their heroes. I bought a used pair of green pants, which I wore daily, even after the knees had split open, and I let the few strands of hair on my chin grow long. I tried to think of myself as a revolutionary in the making, even though I had come to the capital with other ambitions. A decade or so earlier, there had been an important gathering of African writers and scholars at the university. I had read about it in a week-old newspaper that finally made its way to my village. That conference gave shape to my adolescent ambitions, which until then had consisted solely of leaving."],["p","I arrived in the capital poorly prepared. I had read the same few Victorian novels countless times, and I assumed that that was how English was still spoken. Until I met Isaac, I didnât make a single friend. With my long skinny legs and narrow face, he said, I looked more like a professor than like a fighter, and in the beginning that was what he called me: Professor, or the Professor."],["p","âAnd what about you?â I asked him. I assumed that, like others, he had another, more public name that he wanted to be known by. He was shorter but wider than I was, his arms tightly laced with muscles and veins that ran like scars the length of his forearms. He had the build but not the face or demeanor of a soldier. He smiled and laughed too often for me to imagine he could ever hurt someone."],["p","âFor now, Isaac is it,â he said."],["p","His family was from the north of Uganda, from one of the tall, darker tribes that a man in Cambridge had decided were more warrior-like than their smaller cousins to the south. His parents had died in the last round of fighting just before independence. Had the British stayed, Isaac would have done well. He had been bright enough as a child to be talked of as one of the students who could be sent abroad for schooling. But then the whole colonial experiment ended in what seemed like a long bloody afternoon, and boys like Isaac were orphaned a second time."],["p","We had both taken up residence in the eastern quarter of the city, in a hard-to-reach, hilly area prone to mud slides. Isaac was living with friends of cousins, who had agreed to let him sleep on the floor of their living room. I was renting a cot in the back of a drygoods store that on the weekends became a bar for the owner and his friends. On Friday and Saturday nights, I wasnât allowed to come home until 2 or 3 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"A"],".",["em",{"class":"small"},"M"],"., after the bed had been used by the patrons to entertain themselves with some of the young girls in the neighborhood. With no money and nothing to do, I would circle the neighborhood, a maze of rutted, narrow paths that wound slowly up the side of a hill, at the top of which was one of the cityâs newly paved roads. From here, one could look down upon our shanty village as it descended into what had once been a lush valley. I saw Isaac up there twice before we ever spoke to each other. On both occasions he was standing by the side of the road, staring at the passing traffic instead of at the city beneath him. A few days later, I saw him on campus. We were both standing near but not too close to a group of students, trying our best to belong. It was the second week of August, the start of a new semester, and there were students crowded on the central lawn, which was ringed by towering palm trees that gave the campus an air of tropical grandeur far greater than it deserved."],["p","It was with the understanding that we were both liars and frauds, poorly equipped to play the roles we had chosen, that Isaac approached me. We were in a crowd that gathered around a table where a boy with a neatly sculpted Afro was reading off a list of demands. Had Isaac and I not been there at the same time, we might have been moved by the young manâs call for better teachers, lower fees, and more freedom for the students, but all either of us could see from the moment our eyes locked was the otherâs vaguely familiar, possibly hostile face staring back."],["p","Isaac waited for the speech to end. The final words were âThis is ",["em","our"]," university,â followed by brief applause. Everything back then was supposed to be ours. The city, the country, Africaâ they were there for the taking, and, at least in that regard, our approach to the future was no different from that of the Englishmen who preceded us. Many of the boys who were a part of that crowd would later prove the point, as they stuffed themselves with their countryâs wealth."],["p","Isaac stood next to me for a few seconds before he said, âWe should go somewhere and talk.â"],["p","We walked until we were in a neighborhood I had never visited before. Isaac talked the entire time. He had his own version of historyâhalf fact, half mythâwhich he was eager to share. He began each of his stories with âDid you know?â which was his equivalent of âOnce upon a time.â"],["p","âDid you know,â he said, âuntil a decade ago no Africans were allowed to live near the university? This is where the British were planning on building a new palace for the king. If they had lost World War Two, they were going to move all the English people here, and this part of the city was going to be just for them. They were going to make everything look like London so they wouldnât feel so bad about losing. They were going to build a big wall around it and then change all the maps so that it looked like London was in Africa. But every time they started building the wall someone would blow it up. Thatâs how the war for independence started.â"],["p","We stopped at a cafÃ© on a street lined with single-story, tin-roofed stores selling jeans, T-shirts, and brightly patterned ankle-length dresses. We took a table outside. Isaac ordered tea for us. When it came, slightly cooler than he wanted, he sent it back and demanded another. He wanted me to be impressed by his ability to command: in this case, a warmer cup of hot water. Then he crossed his legs, leaned back in his chair, and said, âSoâyou go to the university, too.â"],["p","âYes,â I said."],["p","âEvery day?â"],["p","âEvery day.â"],["p","Isaacâs face softened."],["p","âMy grandfather wanted me to study medicine,â he continued. âBut I have plans of my own.â"],["p","âThen what will you study?â"],["p","âThis is Africa,â he said. âThereâs only one thing to study.â He waited for me to respond. After several dramatic seconds, he sighed and said, âPolitics. Thatâs all we have here.â"],["p","I hadnât learned to speak with such authority. When Isaac asked me what I planned to study, I had to gather my courage before I could reply. âLiterature,â I told him."],["p","He slapped the table with his hand. âThatâs perfect,â he said. âYou look like a professor. What kind of literature will you study?â"],["p","âAll of it,â I said, and here, for once, I spoke with a bit of confidence, because I believed in what I had said. Many of the writers who attended that conference had already begun to make themselves scarce by the time Isaac and I had that conversation: several were in exile in America; others were rumored to be dead or working for a corrupt government. But I dreamed of joining their ranks nonetheless.

aspiring militant, radical, and revolutionary in Eastern and Central Africa was drawn to the university. People started coming shortly after the President took power and declared the country the first African socialist republic: âA beacon of freedom and equality where all men are brothersâ was how he phrased it in the radio address he gave after staging the countryâs first coup. Millions believed him. He spoke the right languageâgrand, pompous, and humble all at the same time. He was from the military, but he claimed he wasnât an Army man, just a poor farmer who had picked up the gun to liberate his people, first from the British and then, after independence, from the corrupt bureaucrats who followed. It was rumored that he had a photographic memory and was a champion chess player, and that every weekend he returned to his farm to tend to his cattle and his crops. Whatever people wanted in a leader and whatever they dreamed of for themselves, they found in him."],["p","For years, the students held on to their socialist, Pan-African dream, while ignoring the corruption and violence that touched the rest of the capital. Now the dream was all but over. There were warring parties and factions split along thin ideological lines. One of the first things Isaac and I did together was to look at the students spread across the lawn in a state of constant protest and divide them into two camps: the real revolutionaries and the campus frauds."],["p","As we walked across the lawn, Isaac pointed to the various student groups and asked what I thought of this person or that. âIs that a real revolutionary?â"],["p","More than half the time, he claimed I was wrong. After a dozen attempts, I asked him what made him so certain he was always right."],["p","âYou know how you can tell?â he said."],["p","He took off one of his shoes and wiggled his dirty toes in the air. He held the shoe, which like my own was covered in dust and had been repaired so many times that there was hardly anything left of the sole."],["p","âLook at the shoes. Anyone who walks to campus has shoes as ruined as ours.â"],["p","The next day, we lay on the grass and pointed out all the polished shoes that passed us. I no longer saw the students as a general, uniform mass. They were part of the same body but lived in different spheres. The day after, I told Isaac, âI donât have to see the shoes. I can tell by the way they stand.â I pointed to a pack of boys on the other side of the campus and said, âChauffeured car,â and according to him I was always right.

weeks passed before I saw Isaac again. I searched for him on campus and in our neighborhood, afraid of what he would say if I found him, or what he would think of me if I didnât try. Then, one day, he walked through the front gates of the university with dark bruises beneath both eyes, a gash across his pointed chin, and a patch of scabs across the right side of his face. He limped, but with forceâas if he were trying to show that the damage wasnât permanentâto our corner of the campus. I watched as every head turned toward him. I knew the injuries were genuine, but still I thought, Youâre doing a wonderful job, Isaac. By the time he reached me, there were pockets of students all across the main lawn whispering about him."],["p","Had I not been so uncertain as to where I stood with him, I would have made more of his return. I would have told him that it was good to see him again, that he had been missed. âSoâyouâre finally back,â I said instead. I couldnât decide if I should hold out my hand."],["p","âYes,â he said. âI knew this place would be empty without me.â"],["p","And we left it there. I followed Isaac toward the center of the campus. When we reached the southwest corner of the lawn, a spot normally occupied by the only two Angolans on campus, we stopped. Isaac didnât acknowledge it, but it was obvious he was feeling tired."],["p","âWe should sit,â he said."],["p","âThereâs a bench over there.â I pointed to a shade-covered spot."],["p","âToo far,â he said, and it was then that I caught the distinct wheezing in his breath. He had carried his limp far enough. He leaned gently on a young tree that bent slightly under his weight. He eased his way onto the ground and pulled his knees up close to his chest."],["p","Every person who passed us stared at Isaac. There were brutally broken bodies begging on street corners across the city, and most of us hardly noticed them. People stared at Isaac because they assumed he was a student at the university, and therefore they thought they knew how he had earned his injuries. Several days earlier, a large crowd of protesters had marched along one of the main boulevards leading to the State House. They were allowed to get within a hundred yards before the tear gas and the clubs came out. A young woman walked past us and, without breaking her stride, said, âOur country needs more boys like you.â"],["p","âYouâve become very popular,â I said, âand you havenât even been around.â"],["p","âI know,â Isaac said. âItâs a shame. I should have had myself beaten earlier. I could have been President by now.â"],["p","I didnât judge him for letting that misconception spread, but only because I believed the timing of his return was a coincidence."],["p","The weeks after that were calm around the university, despite the almost daily protests in the parts of the capital farthest from campus. There were rumors about arrests and violence on the edges of the city, and a few sparely written stories in the English-language newspapers, which I read and then immediately forgot, as if they were dispatches from a foreign country. It was understood that Isaac could always be found in the same spot, even if no one had yet tried to seek him out."],["p","Each day at dusk we made our way slowly home. Isaac was still limping, although less noticeably. Walking required his concentration, but I suspected that he had to remember to struggle. If he was lying about his injury, I was hardly ready to hold him accountable. His wounds had got him somewhere. He was a figure, even if one without a name, and I understood his desire to hold on to that until another step on the universityâs social ladder had been mounted. Only then would he give up the limp and the bandages; fortunately, he would still have the scars. I imagined him, as an old man, pointing to an old wound on his hand or his face, and saying, âThis one came from the police.â Or, âThis one I canât remember anymore.

wasnât long before students began to join Isaac and me by our tree in the center of campus. They had heard only rumors about him and knew nothing about me, but our daily vigil on the grass had made us familiar, comforting figures to gather around. The sole marker we had to distinguish us was a sign that Isaac posted on the tree behind us every day: âWhat Crimes Against the Country have you committed today?â"],["p","The first students who came to Isaac were cousins. Their names were Patience and Hope, and they were dressed in matching pleated gray skirts that were cut almost an inch above the knee."],["p","âSit,â Isaac told them, and then he gestured toward me. âThis is my friend Langston the Professor, the future Emperor of Ethiopia.â Then he said, âNow tell me, what crimes against our country have you committed today?â"],["p","Patience, whose mouth bristled with clean, hard, white teeth, spoke first. âDoes sitting here count as a crime?â she asked."],["p","Isaac smiled. âYes,â he said, âit definitely does.â He turned to Hope, who was leaning against her cousin. âAnd you,â he said. âIf youâre related, then that makes you guilty as well.â"],["p","They laughed. They had come to be amused, and Isaac had charmed them. He didnât try for more than that. After they had played their role, he asked where they were from and what they were studying. Both were majoring in economics; they were born and raised in the capital."],["p","âEconomics,â Isaac said. âThatâs very good.â But I knew that, like me, he had only a vague understanding of what that meant: money, who had it and who didnât. As Patience and Hope walked away, Isaac told them not to forget to say goodbye to the future emperor. Only Patience acknowledged me. âGoodbye, Emperor,â she said. By the time I thought to respond, she was too far away to hear me. Isaac watched me follow her with my eyes."],["p","âDonât worry,â he said. âSheâll be back.â"],["p","Every day more students came and introduced themselves to Isaac. One boy confessed to stealing money from his father, to which Isaac responded, âStealing is not a crime in this country. Not stealing, however, is a terrible thing.â All the boys and girls close enough to hear that made sure everyone saw them laugh. When they were gone, Isaac whispered to me, âDid you see who laughed the hardest?â I hadnât, and I doubted that he had, either, but I knew the answer."],["p","âThe boys with the polished shoes,â I said."],["p","âThatâs right. It was Alex.â"],["p","If students didnât know what to say, he adjusted the rules of his game. He helped them invent their crimes. He borrowed from the Presidentâs daily radio broadcasts, which for months had been long, rambling diatribes against all the enemies of the country, from the Europeans and the Americans to the Africans who were secretly working with them."],["p","âHave you ever been an imperialist?â he asked them. âHave you ever tried to colonize a country?â âDo you listen to British radio?â âDo you know who the Queen of England is?â âHave you ever been friends with a European?â âHave you ever wanted to go to America?â"],["p","In just a few weeks, Isaacâs confessional drew hundreds of students, and, of those, a few dozen returned consistently. Most of us didnât know one anotherâs names or ages or reasons for being there, and that was fine, because silence isnât the same when itâs shared. Its sad and lonely aspects are shunted off. [cartoon id=\"a17968\"]"],["p","The protests that had begun at the start of the semester turned violent at around this time. Returning home one evening, we heard how, in a shanty village that neither of us had ever been to, tires had been thrown over the heads of four soldiers who had come to arrest someone. After a few minutes of watching the soldiers struggle to free themselves, someone doused the tires with gasoline and set them ablaze. The next day, the neighborhood was cordoned off, and for twenty-four hours no one who lived there was allowed to leave. A few days later, several people were shot near the State House gatesâthey were accused of plotting to kill the President. Then the dead peopleâs families and friends were arrested. And so, even though our neighborhood was quiet, everyone who lived around us felt vulnerable. If tomorrow it was decided that your neighbor was trying to undermine the government, then the only thing you could say was âYes, I had suspected that might be possible all along.â"],["p","Up on the hill where the university sat, little had changed. Isaac took down his sign in March. âI think itâs gone on long enough,â he said. He had earned the respect of the revolutionaries on both sides of us. Students waved or said hello as they passed. When he took down the sign, I asked if he knew what he was going to do next."],["p","âI do.â He leaned against his tree and crossed his legs as if preparing to nap. âIâm going to enjoy this for as long as it lasts.â"],["p","The hours we spent on campus followed us home at the end of the day. For weeks we were like visitors in our real lives, and even then we were terrible tourists, purposefully blind to the plainclothesmen who watched all the houses with notebooks in their hands, deaf to the evening shouts around us. I knew it wouldnât last long. My landlord came to my room one evening and told me to pay attention at night, especially when I was supposed to be sleeping. âRest in the day,â he said. âKeep your eyes open at night. I tell this to everyone.â But I knew it was me he was worried about. I was a foreigner. I had no ties to any of the local or even distant tribes. I played on the grass in the afternoon with Isaac, and then worried late at night."],["p","As it turned out, it was Isaac who was cast out into the street first. Not long after the soldiers were burned, the friends of his cousins whom he had been living with told him they could no longer afford to keep him there."],["p","âThey told me they donât have enough space for another person,â he said. That was on the first night of his homelessness, when he came and knocked on my wall sometime after midnight, looking for a place to sleep."],["p","Isaac made a bed on the floor out of the clothes he had brought with him. One of us often fell asleep for a half-hour or less while on campus. Whoever was awake sat guard; most often, I was the one who slept. Those brief naps had become the best sleep I got, because I knew Isaac was next to me and wouldnât leave until I awoke. Now I turned onto my side so I could see his outline on the floor."],["p","âI know youâre tired,â he said. âDonât worry. Nothing is going to happen. Get some sleep.â"],["p","I tried to sound as confident as he did. âIâm not worried,â I said, but it was obvious I was scared and had been for many days."],["p","âYouâre an emperor,â he told me. âKing of kings. No harm can come to you.â"],["p","I listened to him breathe. I counted his breaths. I doubt I made it to a hundred before I was asleep. I didnât wake up until late the next morning, and by then he was gone."],["p","A notice was published in all the newspapers that morning, warning people not to gather in large numbers. It took the top spot on every front page, under headlines such as â",["em",{"class":"small"},"GOVERNMENT WARNS OF INCREASING RISKS IN PUBLIC GATHERINGS"],".â Had the article simply stated what its authors knew to be true, something along the lines of â",["em",{"class":"small"},"MASS ARRESTS AND TORTURE HAVE BEEN PLANNED"],"â or just â",["em",{"class":"small"},"LEAVE NOW"],",â a lot of time and lives could have been saved. Instead, there were several days of random beatings and arrests of young men across the capital before a mass retreat indoors began."],["p","When I saw Isaac on campus again a few days later, I asked him where he was living. He told me that he was staying with someone far away from our neighborhood and that I shouldnât worry. âI have friends who have given me a place,â he said."],["p","I went to campus daily, to see him but also simply to breathe easier, to walk, sit, and read without fear. I knew that this wouldnât hold for much longer; the noose that had been cast over the city would find its way up the hill, regardless of how many government ministersâ children were at the university. Iâm sure Isaac knew this, too, and so did the other students, who, in the days following the headlines, began to gather around him in increasing numbers. The police who patrolled the campus had taken note of the crowd and began to linger around the edge of our group. Someone from inside our circle said, for all, including the guards, to hear, âThere is nothing more restless than anxious men in power.â"],["p","Our gathering was broken up on a Friday afternoon at the start of April, after classes had ended. Our numbers were no larger than they had been the week before: we were twenty or thirty at most. The only difference was that we huddled closer together. When four campus guards in shabby blue uniforms, wielding worn wooden nightsticks, surrounded us, more than a minute passed before any of us thought to run. The closer we were to one another the safer we felt, and each of us was reluctant to give that up."],["p","The guards waited until they were certain they had our attention before they began to swing. The only person who didnât run was Isaac. When I looked for him, he was just standing there, his arms at his sides so that his entire body was fully exposed. A few minutes passed before one of the guards noticed him. He was the perfect image of defiance. Theyâre going to bash his head in, I thought. Seconds later came the crack of wood meeting bone."],["p","The guards left Isaac where he fell. I ran and hid in a parking lot on the eastern edge of the campus. When I came back, ten minutes later, he was gone. I walked to the tree where I had last seen him and searched the grass for any sign that he had been thereâan impression of a body in the grass, a few flecks of bloodâbut there was nothing. I waited for an hour, and then two, knowing he wouldnât return, but hoping that he might see me and know that this time I hadnât abandoned him."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EI%20waited%20each%20night%20for%20Isaac%20to%20knock%20on%20my%20window.%20I%20would%20have%20taken%20him%20in%20without%20hesitation%2C%20but%20I%20was%20afraid%20he%20would%20ask.%20New%20checkpoints%20were%20erected%20daily%2C%20and%20within%20days%20it%20was%20impossible%20to%20penetrate%20the%20cluster%20of%20shacks%20that%20ringed%20our%20neighborhood%20and%20the%20two%20surrounding%20it%20without%20showing%20your%20official%20I.D.%20Every%20coming%20and%20going%2C%20except%20those%20through%20obscure%20back%20routes%20that%20wound%20through%20half-burnt%20piles%20of%20trash%20and%20open%20latrine%20pits%2C%20eventually%20had%20a%20checkpoint%20where%20young%20men%20logged%20into%20notebooks%20the%20names%20and%20occupations%20of%20everyone%20who%20passed.%20No%20bureaucracy%20in%20the%20country%20had%20ever%20worked%20properly%20until%20then.%20Years%20could%20be%20lost%20in%20search%20of%20a%20birth%20certificate%2C%20a%20driver%E2%80%99s%20license%2C%20or%20a%20passport.%20The%20daily%20records%20of%20names%2C%20entries%2C%20and%20departures%20signalled%20the%20end%20of%20that.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EI%20assumed%20Isaac%20had%20chosen%20to%20keep%20his%20distance.%20I%20imagined%20that%2C%20after%20recovering%20on%20a%20bed%20in%20a%20stranger%E2%80%99s%20apartment%2C%20he%20had%20walked%20to%20our%20neighborhood%20and%20taken%20note%20of%20the%20checkpoints%20and%20the%20fatigues%20of%20the%20Presidential%20Guard.%20Then%20he%20would%20have%20turned%20his%20head%20in%20the%20other%20direction%2C%20to%20hide%20the%20bruises%20that%20covered%20his%20face%2C%20and%20walked%20farther%20and%20farther%20north%2C%20past%20the%20last%20of%20the%20slums%2C%20until%20he%20reached%20a%20corner%20of%20the%20city%20that%20was%20barely%20inhabited%20and%20that%20until%20only%20a%20few%20years%20earlier%20had%20been%20a%20village%20of%20a%20dozen%20thatch-roofed%20huts.%20I%20didn%E2%80%99t%20have%20the%20heart%20or%20the%20courage%20to%20imagine%20him%20in%20prison%2C%20much%20less%20dead%3B%20I%20thought%20of%20him%20simply%20as%20lost%2C%20one%20of%20the%20millions%20across%20the%20world%20who%20vanish%20one%20day%20and%20can%20still%20rise%20again.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhen%20I%20returned%20to%20campus%2C%20after%20a%20week%2C%20it%20was%20obvious%20that%20the%20days%20of%20banners%2C%20posters%2C%20and%20speeches%20were%20over.%20I%20knew%2C%20as%20soon%20as%20I%20passed%20through%20the%20metal%20gates%20of%20the%20university%20and%20saw%20at%20least%20a%20hundred%20students%20sitting%20shoulder%20to%20shoulder%2C%20back%20to%20back%2C%20in%20a%20circle%2C%20on%20the%20same%20grounds%20where%20Isaac%20and%20I%20had%20often%20sat%20with%20only%20each%20other%20for%20company%2C%20that%20the%20only%20thing%20left%20of%20the%20campus%20I%20had%20known%20was%20the%20buildings.%20The%20students%20had%20conquered%20that%20piece%20of%20land%2C%20and%20their%20mass%20was%20proof%20of%20the%20lengths%20to%20which%20they%20were%20willing%20to%20go%20to%20defend%20it.%20Something%20was%20smoldering%20along%20the%20edges%20of%20the%20circle%2C%20but%20from%20my%20angle%20it%20was%20impossible%20to%20tell%20what%20had%20been%20burned%3B%20there%20were%20too%20many%20soldiers%20and%20police%20for%20me%20to%20take%20in%20the%20entire%20scene.%20The%20best%20thing%20for%20me%20was%20to%20turn%20around%20and%20leave%20through%20the%20front%20gates.%20This%20was%20not%20my%20fight%20and%20not%20why%20I%20had%20come%20here%2C%20but%20that%20was%20irrelevant%20now.%20I%20was%20no%20longer%20just%20a%20spectator.%20Isaac%20had%20insured%20that.%20I%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20see%20him%20yet%2C%20but%20I%20was%20certain%20he%20was%20at%20the%20center%20of%20that%20crowd%2C%20ready%20for%20battle%2C%20waiting%20for%20me%20to%20join%20him.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","I waited each night for Isaac to knock on my window. I would have taken him in without hesitation, but I was afraid he would ask. New checkpoints were erected daily, and within days it was impossible to penetrate the cluster of shacks that ringed our neighborhood and the two surrounding it without showing your official I.D. Every coming and going, except those through obscure back routes that wound through half-burnt piles of trash and open latrine pits, eventually had a checkpoint where young men logged into notebooks the names and occupations of everyone who passed. No bureaucracy in the country had ever worked properly until then. Years could be lost in search of a birth certificate, a driverâs license, or a passport. The daily records of names, entries, and departures signalled the end of that."],["p","I assumed Isaac had chosen to keep his distance. I imagined that, after recovering on a bed in a strangerâs apartment, he had walked to our neighborhood and taken note of the checkpoints and the fatigues of the Presidential Guard. Then he would have turned his head in the other direction, to hide the bruises that covered his face, and walked farther and farther north, past the last of the slums, until he reached a corner of the city that was barely inhabited and that until only a few years earlier had been a village of a dozen thatch-roofed huts. I didnât have the heart or the courage to imagine him in prison, much less dead; I thought of him simply as lost, one of the millions across the world who vanish one day and can still rise again."],["p","When I returned to campus, after a week, it was obvious that the days of banners, posters, and speeches were over. I knew, as soon as I passed through the metal gates of the university and saw at least a hundred students sitting shoulder to shoulder, back to back, in a circle, on the same grounds where Isaac and I had often sat with only each other for company, that the only thing left of the campus I had known was the buildings. The students had conquered that piece of land, and their mass was proof of the lengths to which they were willing to go to defend it. Something was smoldering along the edges of the circle, but from my angle it was impossible to tell what had been burned; there were too many soldiers and police for me to take in the entire scene. The best thing for me was to turn around and leave through the front gates. This was not my fight and not why I had come here, but that was irrelevant now. I was no longer just a spectator. Isaac had insured that. I couldnât see him yet, but I was certain he was at the center of that crowd, ready for battle, waiting for me to join him.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/the-paper-revolution","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7836cecf40192141c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Africa","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"africa"},{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1cbc41c92e2c9b85da8c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Colonialism","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"colonialism"},{"id":"5c2e1cdce56e652c902746f7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fights","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fights"},{"id":"5c2e1d2c2bc86f2c9a244a49","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Friends","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"friends"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"},{"id":"5c2e1c777e716b454591ada2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Protests","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"protests"},{"id":"5c2e1dd92bfcc72cd92d0696","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Radicals","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"radicals"},{"id":"5c2e1d4b22d4972cd5b83352","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Revolutionaries","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"revolutionaries"},{"id":"5c2e1d3041e4c73c088d781f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Students","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"students"},{"id":"5c2e1ce381ab3335f580f1ed","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Uganda","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"uganda"},{"id":"5c2e1e05397f5b30646d079d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Universities","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"universities"},{"id":"5c2e1c9722d4972cd5b832b7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wealth","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wealth"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5907efd0019dfc3494e9c92f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907efd0019dfc3494e9c92f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fiction","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fiction"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Fiction","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"fiction"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Africa","url":"/tag/africa"},{"name":"Books","url":"/tag/books"},{"name":"Colonialism","url":"/tag/colonialism"},{"name":"Fights","url":"/tag/fights"},{"name":"Friends","url":"/tag/friends"},{"name":"Politics","url":"/tag/politics"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Dinaw

DevontÃ© Hynes, 2013 was either the best year ever or the worst, depending on whatâs more important, success or possessions. In November, the twenty-eight-year-old songwriter, performer, and producer released âCupid Deluxe,â the second album credited to his third project, Blood Orange. The record, which is an excellent assemblage of soignÃ© R.Â &Â B., received almost unanimous praise and spread faster than any of his previous work. (For a week in September, underestimating his own popularity, Hynes was playing a rough draft of the album to strangers who responded to a tweet. He gave one kid his iPhone and let him walk around Washington Square Park with it for half an hour.) Hynes had become more visible toward the end of 2012, when he wrote breakout hits for Sky Ferreira (the clattering pop tune âEverything Is Embarrassingâ) and Solange Knowles (a simmering, off-kilter R.Â &Â B. track called âLosing Youâ). But âCupid Deluxeâ sent him beyond the indie circles he had been travelling in."],["p","Then, on December 16th, while he and his girlfriend were attending a Lou Reed memorial concert at the Apollo, his apartment in the East Village burned down. He lost all his belongings and his three-month-old puppy, Cupid. A few days later, Hynes checked himself in to the hospital for exhaustion. When he woke up the next day, he impulsively booked a solo show for that night at the Cameo Gallery, in Brooklyn, to play songs by one of his old bands, Lightspeed Champion. He said it was a way to âdistract himself.â There are only a few Blood Orange shows planned to promote âCupid Deluxe,â giving Hynes time to regroup and look back and figure out what 2013 was."],["p","Hynes was born in London, to a Guyanese mother and a father from Sierra Leone, and grew up in Essex, East London. His first band, Test Icicles, was a rackety outfit, an uneasy alliance of disco drumming and yelling that drew on dance-infused bands like the Rapture and LCD Soundsystem. Hearing it next to his work in Blood Orange, I find it hard to imagine Hynes having anything to do with Test Icicles. In 2007, he brought a handful of lighter folk songs to America and recorded them in Omaha, at the studio of the indie record label Saddle Creek. Two albums were released under the name Lightspeed Champion. With this material, Hynes had room to deploy his harmony singing, which is papery and sweet, but this music now sounds slightly off balance, as if indie rock were too small a frame for it."],["p","In 2006, Hynes moved to Brooklyn, and something in him was unlocked. His love of New York stretches from its obvious attractions to its subcultures. Often in overalls and a leather cap that fits neatly on top of his shoulder-length dreads, Hynes repeatedly visits major landmarks like the Metropolitan Museum and the Brooklyn Bridge, which he used to photograph and post to his Instagram account until he unplugged (somewhat) and threw away his iPhone, in late November. At the other end of the spectrum is his love of New York dance music, especially a small chunk produced in the early eighties, before rap rearranged the programming priorities of radio. At the time, R.Â &Â B. and dance music were roughly the same thing, a genre that moved beyond the regular time signatures of disco but kept its propulsive feel while letting in Southern and West Indian influences. Artists like Gwen Guthrie, Jocelyn Brown, and Debbie Deb were daytime radio staples on WBLS and Kiss FM."],["p","At a shop in Bed-Stuy, Hynes discovered one of the most important documents of the era, now almost forgotten. A d.j. duo called the Latin Rascals made carefully edited mega-mixes for radio play. Using only recording tape and razors, they seamlessly beat-matched mixes of the dayâs hits. Some tunes ended up with extended intros and breaks that existed nowhere else. These mixes traded hands and created a blend of anxiety and desire. Which was the real version? If you didnât tape it, how could you be sure how it really went?"],["p","âCupid Deluxeâ is Hynesâs homage to this piece of history, which he later found online. His album isnât as frantic as any of the mixtapes, but it has the same uncanny feeling of being steeped in New York yet not immediately identifiable. It could be one of those albums that spawned a single radio hit and then fell out of print. Some references are overt. On âAlways Let U Down,â Hynes samples the thwacking beat from the 1982 club staple âNipple to the Bottle,â by Grace Jones. âClipped Onâ begins with a soft cloud of keyboard and voices and then drops in a bit from a Neneh Cherry song that resembles the most common sample in hip-hop, James Brownâs âFunky Drummer.â The references are mostly subtle, though, and for many non-natives âCupid Deluxeâ will sound like a lost mixtape of its own genre, played over a station you never knew was there."],["p","Hynes likes to ride a heavy mid-tempo beat, sneak in low, sweet keyboards, and sketch out the chords with a choked, clipped guitar sound that recollects the impossibly clean rhythm guitar of the Chic founder Nile Rodgers (a sound that dominated radio in 2013, on Daft Punkâs âGet Luckyâ). Heaviness is not part of the Hynes aesthetic, and âCupid Deluxeâ is a graceful suspension, where sounds bounce lightly, as if your speakers were dangling from rubber bands. Hynesâs voice tends to ascend the scale and rise occasionally into a full falsetto, and always into his head. He or his backup vocalists present the verses in something of an anxious whisper, and the tension is released in the choruses, which generally use fewer words and more singers. His two foils and occasional lead singers are his girlfriend, Samantha Urbani, of Friends, and Chairliftâs Caroline Polachek. His reliance on womenâs voices makes the albumâs signature gender somewhat vague."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EWhen%20I%20first%20met%20Hynes%2C%20last%20fall%2C%20he%20was%20so%20polite%20that%20I%20felt%20like%20bowing%2C%20an%20urge%20I%E2%80%99ve%20never%20had%20with%20a%20pop%20musician.%20He%20has%20a%20personal%20and%20musical%20grace%20that%20is%20at%20odds%20with%20violence%2C%20which%20is%20why%20the%20past%20year%20has%20been%20so%20confusing%20for%20him.%20Though%20he%20did%20write%20and%20play%20almost%20all%20of%20%E2%80%9CEverything%20Is%20Embarrassing%E2%80%9D%20for%20Sky%20Ferreira%E2%80%94the%20video%20version%20is%20his%20demo%2C%20except%20for%20the%20vocals%E2%80%94and%20%E2%80%9CLosing%20You%E2%80%9D%20for%20Solange%2C%20he%20says%20that%20simply%20discussing%20this%20lost%20him%20friendships%20with%20both%20musicians.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBefore%20a%20release%20party%20for%20%E2%80%9CCupid%20Deluxe%2C%E2%80%9D%20back%20in%20November%2C%20at%20285%20Kent%E2%80%94a%20basic%2C%20stripped-down%20cinder-block-box%20performance%20space%20in%20Williamsburg%E2%80%94Hynes%2C%20dressed%20in%20a%20gray%20light-mesh%20suit%2C%20smiled%20and%20lamented%20the%20idea%20of%20falling%20out%20with%20anyone.%20That%20night%2C%20in%20the%20punitively%20crowded%20room%2C%20Hynes%20played%20most%20of%20%E2%80%9CCupid%20Deluxe.%E2%80%9D%20In%20the%20dank%20air%20of%20285%20Kent%2C%20the%20contrast%20between%20the%20sound%20and%20the%20space%20was%20acute.%20Hynes%20is%20making%20increasingly%20elegant%20music%2C%20designed%20for%20imaginary%20yachts%20and%20V.I.P.%20rooms%2C%20or%20for%20an%20R.%C2%A0%26amp%3B%C2%A0B.%20club%20that%20no%20longer%20exists.%20Discussing%20the%20limited%20plans%20for%20performing%20%E2%80%9CCupid%20Deluxe%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20think%20of%20a%20room%20in%20New%20York%20that%20felt%20appropriate%20to%20the%20sound.%20%E2%80%9CI%20don%E2%80%99t%20want%20it%20to%20be%2C%20you%20know%2C%20just%20another%20God-damned%20rock%20show%2C%20another%20one%20in%20the%20queue%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWeeks%20later%2C%20after%20the%20fire%2C%20Hynes%20sounded%20resigned.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20just%20stuff%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20almost%20lucky.%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20think%20about%20it.%20It%E2%80%99s%20all%20gone.%E2%80%9D%20Well%2C%20not%20all.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","When I first met Hynes, last fall, he was so polite that I felt like bowing, an urge Iâve never had with a pop musician. He has a personal and musical grace that is at odds with violence, which is why the past year has been so confusing for him. Though he did write and play almost all of âEverything Is Embarrassingâ for Sky Ferreiraâthe video version is his demo, except for the vocalsâand âLosing Youâ for Solange, he says that simply discussing this lost him friendships with both musicians."],["p","Before a release party for âCupid Deluxe,â back in November, at 285 Kentâa basic, stripped-down cinder-block-box performance space in WilliamsburgâHynes, dressed in a gray light-mesh suit, smiled and lamented the idea of falling out with anyone. That night, in the punitively crowded room, Hynes played most of âCupid Deluxe.â In the dank air of 285 Kent, the contrast between the sound and the space was acute. Hynes is making increasingly elegant music, designed for imaginary yachts and V.I.P. rooms, or for an R.Â &Â B. club that no longer exists. Discussing the limited plans for performing âCupid Deluxe,â he couldnât think of a room in New York that felt appropriate to the sound. âI donât want it to be, you know, just another God-damned rock show, another one in the queue,â he said."],["p","Weeks later, after the fire, Hynes sounded resigned. âItâs just stuff,â he said. âIâm almost lucky. I donât have to think about it. Itâs all gone.â Well, not all.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/smooth-operator-2","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1eaa41c92e2c9b85dc0d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Blood

Among Redscoutâs killer concepts: AirCraft, âa differentiated experience in the air care category that went beyond scent masking/neutralizing or scent delivery to a new scent behavior called Scentmakingâ; Ingenuityâ¢, Parker Penâs âfirst ever hybrid ballpoint/fountain pen with the romance and luxury appeal of a fountain pen and the practicality of a ballpointâ; and the Gatorade G-Series, which transformed that âbrand and business from introducing new flavors for people watching sports on the couch to innovating for real athletes and their needs.â"],["p","Emboldened by a belief that he now knows a thing or two, plus the fact that Redscout was turning thirteen, Disend a few months ago got the inspiration to rebrand the bar mitzvahâtraditionally a life-cycle ritual regarded with gravitas by devout observers of Judaism, a recognized religionâas an office-party motif."],["p","A couple of days before the event, he sat in his office and reflected upon this milestone."],["p","âI grew up in Newton, Massachusetts, and spent seventh and eighth grades going to a lot of bar mitzvahs without having my own,â he said. âThirteen is the most interesting time.

The band members were hairy enough that with a little rearranging and tailoring, plus a repertoire overhaul, they could have passed for a Hasidic klezmer combo. âItâs our first bar mitzvah,â the lead vocalist said."],["p","Disend made a speech in which he thanked his parents and brothers, said that he started Redscout because he âwanted to come up with really fucking creative solutions to big brand and marketplace challenges,â acknowledged that he âmay have yelled at a few too many people over the years; there were lots of tears shed that were not mine,â said he wanted to hug every person in the room, and finally introduced Kingswood."],["p","The band began to play. They were very, very, very loud. So loud that one felt bad for the Episcopal clericsânineteenth- and twentieth-century Seminary faculty membersâwhose portraits hung around the room. Once it became apparent that Disend wasnât going to be hoisted in a chair while everyone danced the hora, the older people did what older people tend to do in such situations.

Paris-based filmmakers who help one another and are also endowed with inspiration and originality. Recent New York screenings of Sophie Letourneurâs âLes Coquillettesâ and Guillaume Bracâs âA World Without Womenâ suggest that thereâs something new in the air over there. Perhaps the most flamboyant film to come from this batch of young directors, Antonin Peretjatkoâs ",["strong","âThe Rendez-Vous of DÃ©jÃ  Vu,â"]," will be shown in the âFirst Lookâ series (running Jan. 10-19, at Museum of the Moving Image), which also includes two documentaries that put it in context."],["p","Peretjatkoâs film is a loopy and audacious comedy with an explicitly political setting. It centers on a group of young adults who, in the face of economic crisis, leave Paris for an impromptu beach trip. Two of themâHector (GrÃ©goire Tachnakian), a guard at the Louvre, and the unemployed Truquette (Vimala Pons), an amateur acrobatâare in love; when they get separated, a carnivalesque chase, led by a quack doctor (Vincent Macaigne), ensues. Peretjatko spins out a variety of comic inventions, including flashbacks and fantasies, perorations into the camera and magic tricksâthere are allusions to Woody Allen and Blake Edwards as well as to Jacques Rivette and Jean-Luc Godardâbut the movieâs original French title, which translates as âThe Girl of July 14th,â reflects the directorâs historical ambitions. The film starts with a breathtaking scene at an actual Bastille Day military parade, which Truquette, the acrobat, somehow infiltrates to peddle a left-wing magazine and French Revolution trinkets. With ricocheting references to Franceâs tradition of violent uprisings, Peretjatko gleefully unleashes the brazen energy of youthâon both sides of the camera."],["p","The documentary ",["strong","âRohmer in Parisâ"]," is composed mostly of clips from the films of Eric Rohmer (who died in 2010, at the age of eighty-nine), a key director of the New Wave. The canny assemblage, by the filmmaker Richard Misek, reveals Rohmerâs career-long emphasis on his charactersâ map-accurate passage through the streets of Paris. For the New Wave directors, the city wasnât just their home base; it was a crucial location. Filming stories arising from their own lives, they turned Paris into a living movie studio. When younger French directors such as Peretjatko film on the same streets, they capture the mythology along with the reality."],["p","A more troubling collision of French politics and movies comes in the documentary ",["strong","âNatan,â"]," by David Cairns and Paul Duane, about the producer Bernard Natan, born Natan Tanenzapf, a Romanian Jew who arrived in France as a young man in 1905 and soon found his way into the movie business. At the end of the nineteen-twenties, he took over the venerable PathÃ© studio, where he produced some of the most respected films of the time. But in the mid-thirties Natan became the target of a fierce anti-Semitic campaign that one scholar, interviewed here, calls âthe Dreyfus affair of the cinema,â and which led to Natanâs death, at Auschwitz, in 1943. Cairns and Duane examine the strange latter-day repercussions of the campaignâincluding the installation of Franceâs leading film school, La FÃ©mis, in buildings constructed by Natan that bear no trace of his name.Â â¦"]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/wavelengths","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ccb397f5b30646d065a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Anti-Semitism","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"anti-semitism"},{"id":"5c2e1c9981ab3335f580f1a1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Documentaries","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"documentaries"},{"id":"5c2e207422d4972cd5b835a0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ãric Rohmer","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"eric-rohmer"},{"id":"5c2e1da641c92e2c9b85db69","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"French New Wave","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"french-new-wave"},{"id":"5c2e1f3481ab3335f580f3be","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Movie Directors","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"movie-directors"},{"id":"5c2e204241c92e2c9b85dcf3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Movie Producers","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"movie-producers"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d051f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Movies","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"movies"},{"id":"5c2e1cc12bc86f2c9a244a0d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Museum of the Moving Image","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"museum-of-the-moving-image"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592f12969573ba0a0a64ffff","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592f12969573ba0a0a64ffff","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"MOVIES","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"movies"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"MOVIES","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"movies"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Anti-Semitism","url":"/tag/anti-semitism"},{"name":"Documentaries","url":"/tag/documentaries"},{"name":"Ãric Rohmer","url":"/tag/eric-rohmer"},{"name":"French New Wave","url":"/tag/french-new-wave"},{"name":"Movie Directors","url":"/tag/movie-directors"},{"name":"Movie Producers","url":"/tag/movie-producers"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Richard Brody","type":"author","title":"Richard Brody began writing for The New Yorker in 1999.

my fifth year in Beijing, I moved into a one-story brick house beside the Confucius Temple, a seven-hundred-year-old shrine to Chinaâs most important philosopher. The temple, which shared a wall with my kitchen, was silent. It had gnarled cypress trees and a wooden pavilion that loomed above my roof like a conscience. In the mornings, I took a cup of coffee outside and listened to the wakeup sounds next door: the brush of a broom across the flagstones, the squeak of a faucet, the hectoring of the magpies overhead."],["p","It was a small miracle that the shrine had survived. Confucius, who was born in the sixth century B.C., traditionally had a stature in China akin to that of Socrates in the West. He stressed compassion, ritual, and duty. âThere is government when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son,â Confucius said. Chairman Mao believed in âpermanent revolution,â and when the Cultural Revolution began, in 1966, he exhorted young Red Guards to âSmash the Four Oldsâ: old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas. Zealots denounced Confucius for fostering âbad elements, rightists, monsters, and freaks,â and one of Maoâs lieutenants gave the approval to dig up his grave. Hundreds of temples were destroyed. By the nineteen-eighties, Confucianism was so maligned that the historian Yu Ying-shih called it a âwandering soul.â"],["p","In September, 2010, nine months after I moved in, I was at my desk one morning when I heard a loudspeaker crackle to life inside the temple. A booming voice was followed by the sound of a heavy bell, then drums and a flute, and the recitation of passages from writings by Confucius and other ancient masters. The performance lasted twenty minutes. An hour later, it was repeated, and an hour after that, and again the next day."],["p","The wandering soul, in one form or another, has been stirring. As China undergoes an economic transformation ten times the speed of the first industrial revolution, people are turning to ancient ideas for a connection to the past. The classics have become such reliable best-sellers that, in 2009, the company behind National Studies Web, a site that sells digitized Confucian texts, went public on the Shenzhen stock exchange. To appeal to entrepreneurs, Peking University and other respected schools created mid-career courses that promised to reveal âcommercial wisdomâ in the classics."],["p","Confucianism has no priesthood or rites of conversion, and is not generally considered a religion, but new members of Chinaâs middle class regard an interest in philosophy and history as a mark of cultivation and cultural nationalism. Parents have enrolled their children at private Confucian academies; I visited a weekend school where children aged three to thirteen were learning the classics by rote, reciting each passage six hundred times. Around the country, Chinese tourists flocked to the surviving Confucius Temples, where they filled out prayer cards. âThe overwhelming number are about exams,â Anna Sun, a sociologist at Kenyon College, who studied the cards, told me. âThey are primarily wishes for the college entrance exam, but also the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"TOEFL"],", the G.R.E., law school.â"],["p","It would have been anathema to Chairman Mao, but his heirs have changed their view on revolution. In the eighties, when China set itself in pursuit of prosperity, the Party studied how Confucian values had helped to stabilize other countries in East Asia. Generations of Chinese thinkers had dreamed of finding the optimal recipe for ânational studiesââthe mixture of philosophy and history that might insulate China from the pressures of Westernization. After the democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989 ended in a violent crackdown, leaders needed an indigenous ideology that might restore the Partyâs moral credibility. Top Communists gave speeches at meetings devoted to Confucianism, and state television launched a series about traditional culture intended, it said, âto boost the peopleâs self-confidence, self-respect, and patriotic thought.â In 2002, the Party officially stopped calling itself a ârevolutionary partyâ and adopted the term âParty in Power.â The Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao, declared, âUnity and stability are really more important than anything else.â In February, 2005, the Party chief, Hu Jintao, quoted Confuciusâ observation that âharmony is something to be cherished.â"],["p","Soon, âharmonyâ was on billboards and in television commercials and intoned by apparatchiks. In 2006, a team of government-backed historians marked Confuciusâ 2,557th birthday by unveiling what they called a âstandardizedâ portrait: a kindly old figure with a luxuriant beard, his hands crossed at his chest. The Chinese Association for the Study of Confucius, supported by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, introduced traditions that had never existed before. It arranged for couples to renew their wedding vows in front of a statue of the sage."],["p","As a gentler alternative to Mao, Confucius has been enlisted as an avatar on the world stage. The opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics made no mention of the Chairman but featured recurring references to harmony and to the classic texts. In the past decade, China has opened more than four hundred Confucius Institutes around the world to teach language, culture, and history. Many universities have welcomed them; the program provides teaching materials and cash. (Some scholars have complained that the institutes seek to limit expression. In July, McMaster University, in Canada, closed its Confucius Institute after a teacher complained that she had been prevented from practicing Falun Gong, the banned spiritual movement.)"],["p","The Confucian revival has been especially visible in the city of Qufu, the sageâs home town, in present-day Shandong Province. In 2007, the cityâs International Confucius Festival was co-sponsored by the Confucius Wine Company. Thousands of people filled a local stadium, giant balloons bearing the names of ancient scholars bobbed overhead, and a Korean pop star performed in an abbreviated outfit. Near the cave where Confucius was said to have been born, a five-hundred-million-dollar museum-and-park complex is under construction; it includes a statue of Confucius that is nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty. In its marketing, Qufu has adopted comparisons to Jerusalem and Mecca and calls itself âThe Holy City of the Orient.â Last year, it received 4.4 million visitors, surpassing the number of people who visited Israel."],["p","No one has harnessed the interest in Confucius more successfully than Yu Dan, a professor of media studies at Beijing Normal University. She presented a popular series of lectures on state television and wrote a book, âConfucius from the Heartâ (2006), that is said to have sold ten million copies. Today, she occupies a position in Chinese pop culture somewhere between Bernard-Henri LÃ©vy and Dr. Phil. She plays down themes that irritate modern readersâsuch as Confuciusâ observation that âwomen and small people are hard to deal withââand writes, reassuringly, âThe truths that Confucius gives us are always the easiest of truths.â Scholars mock her workâone critic attended book signings in a T-shirt that read âConfucius is deeply worriedââbut within a year Yu became the second-highest-paid author in China, after Guo Jingming, a writer of young-adult fiction who travelled with guards to hold back the crowds."],["p","At Yu Danâs headquarters in Beijing, a suite of offices on a high floor at the edge of the campus, her assistant ushered me into a modern conference room. Yu Dan arrived, smiling broadly, and asked the assistant to prepare tea. Yu Dan, who is in her late forties, has high cheekbones and a short, severe haircut. I asked what prompted her to embrace the classics. She said that, like others her age, she had grown up denouncing the ancient scriptures. âWhen I began writing âConfucius from the Heart,â a lot of people asked me, âWhy are you writing this?â And I said, âI am atoning for the crimes of my generation, because we were young and we criticized him mercilessly.âÂ â"],["p","She paused, and turned her attention to the assistant, a graduate student. âChild, how could you be so stupid!â Yu said. âThis tea has been steeping for too long!â She looked at me, and the smile returned. âChildren today do not know how to host people,â she said. After Yu became popular, the Party invited her to conferences, and she began presenting her readings of the classics in a political context. âUnlimited possibility leads to chaos, because you donât know where to go or what to do,â she told me, adding, âWe must rely on a strict system to resolve problems. As citizens, our duty is not necessarily to be perfect moral persons. Our duty is to be law-abiding citizens.â"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EConfucius%E2%80%94or%20Kongzi%2C%20which%20means%20Master%20Kong%E2%80%94was%20not%20born%20to%20power%2C%20but%20his%20idiosyncrasies%20and%20ideas%20made%20him%20the%20Zelig%20of%20the%20Chinese%20classics.%20His%20story%20runs%20through%20the%20ancient%20books%E2%80%94the%20Analects%2C%20Zuozhuan%2C%20Mengzi%2C%20the%20Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian%E2%80%94with%20details%20that%20range%20from%20historical%20to%20mythical.%20His%20father%2C%20Shuliang%20He%2C%20was%20an%20aging%20warrior%E2%80%94physically%20enormous%20and%20famously%20ugly%E2%80%94who%20was%20desperate%20for%20a%20healthy%20son.%20When%20he%20was%20in%20his%20seventies%2C%20he%20found%20a%20teen-age%20concubine%2C%20and%20they%20had%20a%20son%2C%20in%20551%20B.C.%20The%20baby%2C%20like%20his%20father%2C%20was%20unsightly%2C%20with%20a%20crooked%20nose%20and%20a%20bulbous%20forehead%20so%20peculiar%20that%20he%20was%20given%20the%20name%20Qiu%2C%20meaning%20%E2%80%9Cmound.%E2%80%9D%20(Admirers%20insisted%20that%20his%20head%20resembled%20a%20crown.)%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%5Bcartoon%20id%3D%26quot%3Ba17951%26quot%3B%5D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhen%20Confucius%20was%20three%2C%20his%20father%20died%2C%20and%20his%20mother%20set%20off%20with%20her%20toddler%20to%20find%20a%20livelihood.%20As%20a%20boy%2C%20he%20worked%20and%20lost%20himself%20in%20poetry%20and%20imagination.%20He%20married%20at%20eighteen%20or%20nineteen%2C%20but%20was%20bored%20and%20frustrated%2C%20because%20he%20lacked%20the%20connections%20to%20realize%20his%20ambition%20of%20becoming%20a%20bureaucrat.%20Instead%2C%20he%20offered%20to%20teach%20students%20of%20every%20social%20class.%20It%20was%20an%20era%20of%20war%20and%20corruption%2C%20and%20Confucius%20argued%20that%20rituals%20could%20teach%20people%20to%20reconcile%20their%20desires%20to%20the%20needs%20of%20family%20and%20community.%20He%20was%20an%20optimist.%20A%20virtuous%20ruler%2C%20he%20said%2C%20is%20like%20the%20wind%3A%20%E2%80%9CThe%20moral%20character%20of%20those%20beneath%20him%20is%20the%20grass.%20When%20the%20wind%20blows%2C%20the%20grass%20bends.%E2%80%9D%20He%20finally%20earned%20a%20government%20post%2C%20but%20his%20reforms%20threatened%20other%20officials%2C%20and%2C%20as%20legend%20has%20it%2C%20they%20concocted%20a%20plan%20to%20drive%20him%20out%3A%20They%20sent%20his%20superior%20eighty%20beautiful%20girls%2C%20who%20succeeded%20in%20occupying%20the%20boss%20so%20thoroughly%20(he%20disappeared%20for%20three%20days)%20that%20the%20righteous%20Confucius%20had%20to%20leave.%20Humiliated%2C%20Confucius%20began%20travelling%20about%20the%20country%2C%20pointing%20out%20abuses.%20He%20met%20a%20woman%20whose%20husband%20and%20son%20had%20been%20eaten%20by%20tigers%2C%20and%20he%20told%20his%20disciples%2C%20%E2%80%9CAn%20oppressive%20government%20is%20more%20terrible%20than%20tigers.%E2%80%9D%20Confucius%20was%20so%20radical%20that%20a%20fellow-sage%2C%20Laozi%20(said%20to%20be%20the%20founder%20of%20Taoism)%2C%20warned%20him%20against%20%E2%80%9Call%20this%20huffing%20and%20puffing%2C%20as%20though%20you%20were%20carrying%20a%20big%20drum%20and%20searching%20for%20a%20lost%20child.%E2%80%9D%20To%20Confucius%2C%20harmony%20was%20consensus%2C%20not%20conformity.%20It%20required%20loyal%20opposition.%20A%20country%20is%20at%20risk%2C%20he%20said%2C%20when%20a%20prince%20believes%20that%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20only%20joy%20in%20being%20a%20prince%20is%20that%20no%20one%20opposes%20what%20one%20says.%E2%80%9D%20Warlords%20ignored%20him%20or%20tried%20to%20kill%20him.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EConfucius%20never%20imagined%20that%20he%20would%20become%20an%20icon.%20%E2%80%9CHe%20liked%20conversations.%20They%20helped%20him%20think%2C%20but%20he%20never%20expected%20anyone%20to%20write%20them%20down%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20historian%20Annping%20Chin%20observed%2C%20in%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Authentic%20Confucius%3A%20A%20Life%20of%20Thought%20and%20Politics%E2%80%9D%20(2007).%20%E2%80%9CConfucius%20did%20not%20wish%20to%20have%20his%20words%20end%20up%20as%20rules%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20wrote%2C%20because%20%E2%80%9Che%20loved%20the%20idea%20of%20being%20human.%20He%20loved%20the%20entirely%20private%20journey%20of%20finding%20what%20was%20right%20and%20feasible%20among%20life%E2%80%99s%20many%20variables.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAfter%20thirteen%20years%20of%20wandering%2C%20Confucius%20returned%20home%20to%20his%20books%2C%20and%20he%20died%2C%20in%20his%20seventies%2C%20convinced%20that%20he%20was%20a%20failure.%20Of%20his%20three%20thousand%20students%2C%20only%20seventy-two%20were%20true%20disciples%2C%20said%20to%20have%20mastered%20his%20teachings%2C%20which%20they%20compiled%20in%20the%20Analects.%20His%20rules%20made%20him%20exhausting%20to%20be%20around.%20%E2%80%9CWhen%20the%20meat%20was%20not%20cut%20squarely%2C%20he%20would%20not%20eat%2C%E2%80%9D%20his%20disciples%20wrote.%20%E2%80%9CWhen%20a%

Kongzi, which means Master Kongâwas not born to power, but his idiosyncrasies and ideas made him the Zelig of the Chinese classics. His story runs through the ancient booksâthe Analects, Zuozhuan, Mengzi, the Records of the Grand Historianâwith details that range from historical to mythical. His father, Shuliang He, was an aging warriorâphysically enormous and famously uglyâwho was desperate for a healthy son. When he was in his seventies, he found a teen-age concubine, and they had a son, in 551 B.C. The baby, like his father, was unsightly, with a crooked nose and a bulbous forehead so peculiar that he was given the name Qiu, meaning âmound.â (Admirers insisted that his head resembled a crown.)"],["p","[cartoon id=\"a17951\"]"],["p","When Confucius was three, his father died, and his mother set off with her toddler to find a livelihood. As a boy, he worked and lost himself in poetry and imagination. He married at eighteen or nineteen, but was bored and frustrated, because he lacked the connections to realize his ambition of becoming a bureaucrat. Instead, he offered to teach students of every social class. It was an era of war and corruption, and Confucius argued that rituals could teach people to reconcile their desires to the needs of family and community. He was an optimist. A virtuous ruler, he said, is like the wind: âThe moral character of those beneath him is the grass. When the wind blows, the grass bends.â He finally earned a government post, but his reforms threatened other officials, and, as legend has it, they concocted a plan to drive him out: They sent his superior eighty beautiful girls, who succeeded in occupying the boss so thoroughly (he disappeared for three days) that the righteous Confucius had to leave. Humiliated, Confucius began travelling about the country, pointing out abuses. He met a woman whose husband and son had been eaten by tigers, and he told his disciples, âAn oppressive government is more terrible than tigers.â Confucius was so radical that a fellow-sage, Laozi (said to be the founder of Taoism), warned him against âall this huffing and puffing, as though you were carrying a big drum and searching for a lost child.â To Confucius, harmony was consensus, not conformity. It required loyal opposition. A country is at risk, he said, when a prince believes that âthe only joy in being a prince is that no one opposes what one says.â Warlords ignored him or tried to kill him."],["p","Confucius never imagined that he would become an icon. âHe liked conversations. They helped him think, but he never expected anyone to write them down,â the historian Annping Chin observed, in âThe Authentic Confucius: A Life of Thought and Politicsâ (2007). âConfucius did not wish to have his words end up as rules,â she wrote, because âhe loved the idea of being human. He loved the entirely private journey of finding what was right and feasible among lifeâs many variables.â"],["p","After thirteen years of wandering, Confucius returned home to his books, and he died, in his seventies, convinced that he was a failure. Of his three thousand students, only seventy-two were true disciples, said to have mastered his teachings, which they compiled in the Analects. His rules made him exhausting to be around. âWhen the meat was not cut squarely, he would not eat,â his disciples wrote. âWhen a thing was not accompanied by its proper sauce, he would not eat.â But in times of war or instability his dictates on how to dress, how to govern, and how to live held out the tantalizing promise of order. A prime minister later remarked, âWith just half the Analects, I can govern the empire.â"],["p","In the centuries that followed, Confucianism was manipulated and buffeted by politics. In 213 B.C., the first emperor of China sought to put knowledge under government control and ordered the burning of books, including Confucian texts. People who invoked them were executed or sentenced to labor in exile. Confucianism was revived in the subsequent dynasty, the Han, and was Chinaâs state ideology for much of the next two millennia.

few days after I heard the loudspeaker next door, a large banner went up in our neighborhood, identifying the temple as âThe Holy Land of National Studies.â For the first time since the Communist Party came to power, in 1949, the temple was putting on a celebration of Confuciusâ birthday. The occasion featured speeches by government officials and professors and a recitation by children. I figured that the event would probably signal the end of the daily musical shows, but in the weeks that followed they continued, and followed a regular schedule: every hour, ten to six, seven days a week, rain or shine. The sound echoed off the walls of the houses beside the temple, and what had begun as a novelty gradually wore grooves into the minds of my neighbors. Huang Wenyi, an employee at a recycling yard, who lived next door, told me, âI hear it in my head at night. Itâs like Iâve been on a boat all day and I can still feel the rocking.â"],["p","His face brightened with an idea. âYou should go tell them to turn down the volume.â"],["p","âWhy me?â"],["p","âBecause youâre a foreigner. Theyâll pay attention to you.â"],["p","I wasnât sure I wanted the kind of attention that comes from complaining about Chinaâs most famous philosopher. But I was curious about the show and arranged to visit the head of the temple, a man named Wu Zhiyou. Wu looked less like a theologian than like an actor whoâd play the kindly father in a Chinese soap opera: in his mid-fifties, he had a large, handsome face, a perfect pair of dimples in his cheeks, and a resonant voice that sounded somehow familiar. Before being posted to run the temple, he had spent most of his career in the research office of the cityâs Propaganda Department, and he had a mind for marketing. Of the performance, he said, âThis show has attracted people from all levels of societyâChinese and foreigners, men and women, well educated and less educated, experts and ordinary people.â"],["p","I asked if he was involved in the production. âIâm the chief designer!â he said, eyes shining. âI oversaw every detail. Even the narratorâs voice is mine.â"],["p","The show had been conceived under demanding circumstances. Wu had been given only a monthâs notice before the birthday celebration. He hired a composer, recruited dancers from a local art school, and selected lines from the classics that could lend the performance a narrative shape. âYou need ups and downs and a climax, just like a movie or a play,â he said. âIf itâs too bland, it will never work.â"],["p","Wu had succeeded in making the Confucius Temple into his own community theatre, and he was savoring his role. âIn junior middle school, I was always the student leader of the propaganda section of the student council,â he said. âI love reading aloud, and music and art.â In his spare time, he still did cross-talk comedy routines, the Chinese version of standup. He had plans for the templeâs future. âWeâre building a new set that will have ceramic statues of the seventy-two disciples. And we need more lighting. Then, maybe, I can say it is complete.â"],["p","Wu checked his watch. He wanted me to catch the three-oâclock show. He gave me a book on the history of the temple and said, âAfter you read this book, your questions will no longer be questions.â"],["p","The stage, in front of a pavilion on the north side of the compound, had been fitted with lights. The cast consisted of sixteen young men and women in scholarsâ robes; each song-and-dance routine was named for a line from the classicsâthe Analects, the Book of Songs, the Book of Rites, and othersâand had an upbeat interpretation: âHappinessâ was based on the line âGood fortune lies within bad; bad fortune lies within good.â (The stage version omitted the ominous second clause.) The finale, âHarmony,â linked Confucius and the Communist Party.

read the book that Wu gave me, and the depth of detail about ancient events was impressive: it recorded who planted which trees on the temple grounds seven hundred years ago. But it was conspicuously silent on other matters, including the years between 1905 and 1981. In the official history of the Confucius Temple, most of the twentieth century was blank."],["p","During my time in China, I had learned to expect that renderings of history came with holes, like the dropouts in an audio recording when the music goes silent and resumes as if nothing had happened. Some of those edits were ordained from above: for years the people were barred from discussing the crackdown at Tiananmen Square or the famine of the Great Leap Forward, which took between thirty million and forty-five million lives, because the Party had never repudiated or accepted responsibility for those events. Ordinary Chinese had few choices: some accepted the forgetting, because they were poor and determined to get on with their lives; some raged against it, but lacked the political means to resist."],["p","There were other books about the Confucius Temple, and these filled in the blanksâespecially about the night of August 23, 1966, during the opening weeks of the Cultural Revolution. The order to âSmash the Four Oldsâ had devolved into a chaotic assault on authority of all kinds. That afternoon, a group of Red Guards summoned one of Chinaâs most famous writers, Lao She, to the templeâs front gate."],["p","Lao She was sixty-seven and one of Chinaâs best hopes for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He had grown up not far from the temple, in poverty, the son of an imperial guard who died in battle against foreign armies. In 1924, he went to London and stayed for five years, living near Bloomsbury and reading Conrad and Joyce. He wore khakis because he couldnât afford tweeds. In 1936, he wrote âRickshaw Boy,â about a young rickshaw puller whose encounters with injustice turn him into a âdegenerate, selfish, hapless product of a sick society.â Lao She also lived in America, for more than three yearsâon Manhattanâs Upper West Sideâbut he eventually returned to China and became to Beijing what Victor Hugo was to Paris: the cityâs quintessential writer. The Party named him a âPeopleâs Artist.â He resented being asked to produce propaganda, but, like many, he was a loyal servant who poured criticism on his fellow-writers when they fell out with the Party."],["p","Now he was the target. A group of Red Guardsâmostly schoolgirls of fifteen and sixteenâpushed him through the gates of the temple and forced him to kneel on the flagstones beside a bonfire, among other writers and artists. His accusers denounced him for his ties to America and for amassing dollars, a common accusation at the time."],["p","They shouted âDown with the anti-Party elements!â and used leather belts with heavy brass buckles to whip the old men and women. Lao She was bleeding from the head, but he remained conscious. Three hours later, he was taken to a police station, where his wife retrieved him."],["p","The next morning, Lao She rose early and walked northwest from his home to a pond called the Lake of Great Peace. He read poetry and wrote until the sun set. Then he took off his shirt and draped it over a tree branch, loaded his pockets with stones, and walked into the lake. [cartoon id=\"a17971\"]"],["p","When the body was discovered the next day, his son, Shu Yi, was summoned to collect it. The police had found his fatherâs clothes, his cane, his glasses, and his pen, as well as a sheaf of papers that he had left behind. The official ruling on his death declared that Lao She had âisolated himself from the people.â He was a âcounter-revolutionaryâ and was barred from receiving a proper burial. The body was cremated without ceremony. His widow and children put his spectacles and his pen into a casket and buried it."],["p","I wondered about the son, Shu Yi. He would be in his seventies now, older than his father was when he died. I asked around and discovered that he lived only a few minutesâ walk from my house. He invited me over. Shu Yi had white hair and a heavy, kind face, and his apartment was cluttered with books and scrolls and paintings. As we talked, a soft breeze blew in the window from a nearby canal. I asked if he had ever learned more about his fatherâs suicide."],["p","âItâs hard to know exactly, but I think his death was his final act of struggle,â Shu Yi said. âMany years later, I came upon an article called âPoets,â which he had written in 1941ââa quarter century before he died. âHe wrote, âPoets are a strange crowd. When everyone else is happy, the poets can say things that are discouraging. When everyone else is sorrowful, the poets can laugh and dance. But when the nation is in danger they must drown themselves and let their deaths be a warning in the name of truth.âÂ â"],["p","This sacrifice was a tradition in China, dating to the third century B.C., when the poet Qu Yuan drowned himself in protest against corruption. Shu Yi told me, âBy doing so, they are fighting back, telling others what the truth really is.â His father, he said, âwould rather break than bend.â"],["p","After I talked to Shu Yi, I went back to see Wu Zhiyou, the head of the temple, and asked him about the story of Lao Sheâs final night. He gave a short sigh and said, âItâs true. During the Cultural Revolution, there were struggle sessions here. Afterward, Lao She went home and threw himself in the lake. This can be described as a historical fact.â"],["p","Why had the templeâs written history made no mention of it?"],["p","Wu struggled to find an answer, and I braced myself for a dose of propaganda. But then he said, âItâs too sad. It makes people too sad. I think itâs best not to include this in books. Itâs factual, itâs history, but it was not because of the temple. It was because of the time. It doesnât belong in the records of the Confucius Temple.â"],["p","I understood his point, but the explanation felt incomplete. Lao She was beaten in the temple because it was a place of learning, of ideas, of history; the permission to attack one of Chinaâs most famous novelists was, like so much of the Cultural Revolution, the permission to attack what it meant to be Chinese, and in the decades since then the Party and the people had never reconciled all that they lost in those moments. Even if someone wanted to mark the site where Beijingâs greatest chronicler ended his life, it would be difficult; the Lake of Great Peace was filled in decades ago, during an extension of the subway system. I have often marvelled at how much people in China have managed to put behind them: revolution, war, poverty, and the upheavals of the present. My neighbor Huang lived with his mother, who was eighty-eight.

Cultural Revolution dismantled Chinaâs ancient belief systems, and the economic revolution that followed could not rebuild them. Prosperity had yet to define the ultimate purpose of the nation and the individual. There was a hole in Chinese life that people called the ",["em","jingshen kongxu"],"ââthe spiritual void.â"],["p","Every day, I noticed groups of civil servants from the hinterlands and students from around the city visiting the Confucius Temple. One young guide with a ponytail spoke to a group of middle-aged Chinese women. She held her hands out before her. âThis is the gesture for paying respects to Confucius,â she said. Her visitors did their best to copy her. For many people in China, I realized, the gaps in history had made Confucius a stranger. It was difficult to know where his life ended and the mythology and the politics began. Annping Chin wrote, âWe give him credit for all that has gone right and wrong in China because we do not really know him.â"],["p","In that vacuum, some in China have been eager to put the philosopher to more useful political purposes. In October, 2010, the dissident writer Liu Xiaobo, who is serving an eleven-year sentence for subversion, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. That enraged the Chinese government. In response, a group of nationalists organized what they called the âConfucius Peace Prize,â and awarded it, the next year, to Vladimir Putin, for bringing âsafety and stability to Russia.â At times, the embrace of Confucius has turned hostile. In December, 2010, a group of ten well-known classical scholars denounced a plan to build a large Christian church in Qufu, Confuciusâ home town. âWe beseech you to respect this sacred land of Chinese culture, and stop the building of the Christian church at once,â they wrote. The government tried to argue that there was a precedent for having a church in town, but the protest attracted the support of grassroots Confucian associations and Web sites, and construction was postponed."],["p","In China, the official embrace of Confucius has come to be seen by some as suffocating. When, in the name of protecting political stability, censors remove critical comments from the Chinese Web, savvy users say that their words have been âharmonized.â The Partyâs conception of Confucian harmony leaves little room for the politics of negotiation, for an honest clash of ideas. After the pop scholar Yu Dan became a sensation, Li Ling, a Peking University professor, published âStray Dog: My Reading of the Analects,â in which he criticized the âmanufactured Confucius.â He wrote, âThe real Confucius, the one who actually lived, was neither a sage nor a king.Â .Â .Â . He had no power or statusâonly morality and learningâand dared to criticize the power Ã©lite of his day. He travelled around lobbying for his policies, racking his brains to help the rulers of his day with their problems, always trying to convince them to give up evil ways and be more righteous.Â .Â .Â . He was tormented, obsessed, and driven to roam, pleading for his ideas, more like a stray dog than a sage.â"],["p","When Liâs book came out, in May, 2007, he was denounced by other classical scholars, such as Jiang Qing, a prominent Confucian political thinker, who called the author âa cynical doomsday prophet who deserves no response.â One of Liâs defenders was Liu Xiaobo. Before Liu went to prison, he warned of a mood in which âConfucianism was venerated and all other schools of thought were banned.â Instead of invoking Confucius, Liu wrote, intellectuals should be venerating âindependence of thought and autonomy of person.â"],["p","The longer I lived beside the Confucius Temple the more I sensed the gap between what people asked of it and what it provided. The Chinese came to the temple, to the Holy Land of National Studies, on a quest for some kind of moral continuity. But it rarely gave them what they wanted. The Party, to maintain its hold over history, offered a caricature of Confucius. Generations of Chinese had grown up condemning Chinaâs ethical and philosophical traditions, only to find that the Party was now abruptly resurrecting them, without granting permission to discuss what had happened in the interim. Hu Shuli, a progressive editor, described a âcollective amnesiaâ surrounding the Cultural Revolution. âFiles on that episode in our history remain âsecret,âÂ â she wrote. âOlder generations do not dare look back, while our younger generations donât have the remotest inkling of the Cultural Revolution.â"],["p","There were signs that liberal intellectuals were not the only ones losing patience with the official rendering of Confucius. In November, 2012, Yu Dan appeared before an audience at Peking University after a performance of Chinese opera, and the students booed her. They shouted that she didnât deserve to be onstage with serious scholars. âGet out of here!â someone yelled, and Yu made a hasty exit. The previous winter, a large statue of Confucius appeared beside Tiananmen Square, the first new addition to such a sensitive spot since Maoâs mausoleum was erected, a generation ago. Philosophers and political scientists wondered if it signalled an official change to the Party platform. But then, four months after it arrived, the statue disappeared. It was moved, in the middle of the night, to a much less prominent site, in the courtyard of a museum. The reason for the move remained a mystery, because the Central Propaganda Department barred Chinese journalists from writing about it. People were left to joke that Confucius, the itinerant teacher from Shandong Province, had been caught trying to live in Beijing without the proper permit.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/confucius-comes-home","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e2042c1c40c2ca0b54c79","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Beijing,

director of âLabor Dayâ is Jason Reitman. In âThank You for Smoking,â âJuno,â âUp in the Air,â and âYoung Adult,â he presented a fairly full set of comic credentials, even if most of them were edged in black. âLabor Day,â based on the novel by Joyce Maynard, is his first straight-up drama, with the smiles cut off: a risky move, as Woody Allen demonstrated when he stepped from âAnnie Hallâ into the gloom of âInteriors.â"],["p","The action unfolds over the Labor Day weekend of 1987, in the home of Adele (Kate Winslet) and her son, Henry (Gattlin Griffith), who is thirteen. Adele is divorced, and incapacitated by sorrow. So we are told, in voice-over, by the grownup Henry (Tobey Maguire), who reflects on past events and makes sure that we donât have to work anything out for ourselves. âI donât think losing my father broke my motherâs heart, but, rather, losing love itself,â Henry says, apparently reading from the collected lyrics of Kenny Rogers."],["p","Adele is as frail as a leaf, and she rarely goes out. That may be a good thing, given her anxiety at the wheel, and one trip to the store confirms her fears. There she and Henry meet Frank (Josh Brolin), a desperado with a bleeding wound in his belly. He grips Henry by the neck and begs a ride, adding, in the most menacing moment of the film, âFrankly, this needs to happen.â He frightens them into taking him back to their place and giving him refuge till the coast is clear. Unfortunately, the coast is packed. Frank is an escaped convict, like Magwitch, and the cops are scouring the district. What they fail to realize is that Frank poses no threat at all. In fact, he is the Shane of the suburbs: a combination of Boy Scout, dreamboat, handyman, pussycat, and saint. He is just what every household requires. Frankâs the man."],["p","The cinematography is by Eric Steelberg, and itâs beautiful and precise, although most of the beauty, to be honest, arises from a prolonged, often intimate contemplation of Josh Brolinâs enormous skill set. Frank ties Adele to a chair, to prevent her from fleeing, but then, by way of compensation, he makes chili, which he spoon-feeds to her as if she were a baby. Soon, her bonds are loosened, but sheâs not going anywhere, because Frank is on a roll. He chops wood; he gives Henry, a reluctant ballplayer, a batting lesson; he fixes the plumbing; he lies under the car and fixes that. By now, Adele is giving him a look that says, âFix me.â But wait. Frank is making dessert. He slices peaches and slithers them around in his manly hands, murmuring, âThe filling is easy, but I want to talk about crust.â Who doesnât? A closeup takes us to the heart of the oven, where the completed, juicy masterwork seethes and heaves. Yeah, baby, yeah!"],["p","Watching âLabor Day,â you wonder, for the thousandth time, about the place of sex in American cinema. So many deeds are done, and so many needs are catered to, in the turbid tributaries of pornography that almost nothing is left to the mainstream except the sluggish art of suggestion, at once overwrought and prim. âThereâs another kind of hungerâa hunger for human touch,â Adele says, for the sake of any audience members who are too dozy to understand the food scenes. Needless to say, when she and Frank ",["em","do"]," get it on, we see nothing, and we hear nothing but a few stifled mutterings through the wall. For all Henry knows, they could be playing Scrabble. âLabor Dayâ is hardly novel in proposing an overlap between the criminal and the carnal; that common ground was prowled long ago, by the scandalous ardors of film noir. What is unusual about Reitmanâs movie is that it takes a bad boy and drains the badness out of him before he has a chance to do anything bad. Early on, we learn that Frank is a convicted murderer, but, as he argues, âIâve never intentionally hurt anyone in my life,â a claim borne out by a series of lumbering flashbacks. You have to feel sorry for Brolin. Here was his chance to play hot and nasty, instead of which he ends up presenting a do-it-yourself domestic dream: how to build a family in a weekend."],["p","In the latter stages, âLabor Dayâ acquires a spurt of melodrama, as the plot is chivvied along by the charactersâ insistence on making incredibly dumb decisions. If you plan to skip town with a fugitive, for instance, is it wise to withdraw your money from the local bank in one swoop? Or, if a kid writes a letter to his father, explaining everything and saying goodbye, should he (a) walk a long way and deliver it by hand, thus exposing himself to immediate risk, or (b) wait awhile and then send it via a clever invention called âthe mailâ? I mention these follies because they clash so badly with the toneâplangent and pensiveâthat Reitman tries to establish in his joke-free zone. You can love the look of the movie and still not believe a single word of it. To be fair, the climax is surprisingly touching; somehow, the residents of this cooked-up tale manage to earn our pity and support.

how loosely âThe Selfish Giantâ is based on Oscar Wildeâs story of the same name becomes clear within the first ten seconds. Arbor (Conner Chapman), a lad of thirteen, lies under his bed and pounds his fists against the base of it. Swear words arc and spit from him like sparks, although they are barely words; such is Arborâs rage that it issues, more often than not, in a blur of noise and motion. Waiting outside a house, next to a lamppost, he shins up it, just for something to do. He takes pills for his hyperactivity, but his older brother, a drug addict, keeps stealing them. Their mother cannot control her sons, and there is no man around. Arbor is expelled from school for bad behavior, leaving a blank where his future is meant to be. He is, in short, on the scrap heap."],["p","That, however, is where he comes to life. The collecting of scrap metal may not be big business, but itâs business, and thatâs enough for Arbor and his best friend, Swifty (Shaun Thomas), whose own family setup makes Arborâs home look like the Little House on the Prairie. The boys gather any metals they can lay hands on, pots and pans included, and sell them to Kitten (Sean Gilder), a local scrap merchant. Names are a scabrous pleasure here; Swiftyâs feckless father is called Price Drop (Steve Evets), and Kitten is a big and mangy brute, who, ravening for profit, likes to keep his paws clean while others do the dirty work for him. Nothing is dirtier or more dangerous than collecting electric cable, which has to be stripped of its plastic sheathing to reveal the precious bright wire, as it is known, that lies beneath. Kitten has a toothed machine for the stripping; at one point, to instill fear, he feeds Arborâs hand toward the teeth."],["p","The director is Clio Barnard, and the setting is Bradford, in the North of England, close to where âThe Arbor,â her previous work, took place. That was a more self-conscious exercise, braiding documentary with fiction. The new film follows a simpler and more fabular track, asking us not to question but to trust its authenticity. Such trust is soon given, not least because you believe at once in the comradeship of the kidsâArbor the skinny grifter, who orders the police to take their shoes off when they come to quiz him about cable theft, and the softer bulk of Swifty, who has a gentle way with the horses that graze on public scrubland behind their streets. We even get a sulky race, sulkies being the two-wheeled carts that are hitched to the horses and pulled at speedâat dawn, and completely against the lawâalong the highway, with teams of backers driving behind and blocking traffic. You couldnât make it up, and you donât have to."],["p","And what of Wilde? How much of his fairy tale remains, and who, or what, might the selfish giant be? Well, Kitten is one candidate; Gilder, perfectly cast in the role, gives the best kind of supporting performance, not hogging the stage but winning our attention on the sly. One brief scene, late in the film, when he finally admitsâin a low voice that we havenât heard beforeâto doing something wrong, is a thing of wonder, as his pride bottoms out into humility. But there are other giants: the fat gray chimneys of the power stations that lower over the land, against skies the color of nothing, and the pylons that stand sentry into the distance. The electric charge they carry is lethal, but to Arborâs greedy gaze it seems magnetic. From the beginning, you can feel this restive, pulsing movie burn from discontent toward disaster. The whole thing should sap the spirit, and make you despair of a lost and wasted country, yet you are constantly shocked awake by the energy of Arbor, whether it is spent on insolence, initiative, or grief. The boyâs a bright wire.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/partners-in-crime","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e3636cecf40192143ac","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jason Reitman","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"jason-reitman"},{"id":"5c2e20564a08312cd3aa6f35","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Josh Brolin","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"josh-brolin"},{"id":"5c2e1ef42396212cbb9fcba7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kate Winslet","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kate-winslet"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d051f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Movies","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"movies"},{"id":"5c2e2cf62710c62d10815840","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tobey Maguire","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tobey-maguire"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"590a11ef8b51cf59fc42475e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a11ef8b51cf59fc42475e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current Cinema","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-current-cinema"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"The Current Cinema","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"the-current-cinema"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Jason Reitman","url":"/tag/jason-reitman"},{"name":"Josh Brolin","url":"/tag/josh-brolin"},{"name":"Kate Winslet","url":"/tag/kate-winslet"},{"name":"Movies","url":"/tag/movies"},{"name":"Tobey Maguire","url":"/tag/tobey-maguire"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Anthony Lane","type":"author","title":"Anthony Lane has been a film critic for \u003cem>The New Yorker\u003c/em> since 1993.

upon a time, in the deeper reaches of your cable box, you could stumble across a show called âMystery Science Theater 3000.â The program, which bounced across several networks from 1988 to 1999 and was known to its devotees as MST3K, was about a goofball named Joel, who, having been marooned in space and forced to watch crummy movies like âTeenagers from Outer Spaceâ and âWar of the Colossal Beast,â quipped his way through it all with the help of his wisecracking robot pals. The premise was shaky, but the execution was so delightful that the show inspired an industry of riffing on lame pop culture, from âPop Up Videoâ to âTalk Soupâ to âChelsea Latelyâ to everyone live-tweeting the Oscars with zingers like âNice dressânot!â"],["p","A while back, the five members of the MST3K gang, who have toured since 2007 as a live act called Cinematic Titanic, appeared at Broadwayâs Best Buy Theatre. Backstage, the performersâwho, with their dark shirts and their eerily pale skin, seemed like affable vampiresâexpressed bewilderment at the avalanche of meta-scorn they had inadvertently touched off. Joel Hodgson, the showâs creator and star, observed, âYou can sell an audience on snark, but theyâll get tired of it. Our idea was always just that weâre the perfect companions to watch a bad movie with.â"],["p","The group treated that nightâs film, a 1974 gem of kung-fu blaxploitation called âEast Meets Watts,â as the occasion for a freewheeling variety act, complete with songs and spit takes. As a chop-socky master named Larry Chin and a black stud namedâwithout apparent ironyâStud Brown laid waste to most of the hoods and âhoods in Los Angeles, the comics pounced on every wayward detail, from the actorsâ names (âAlan Tang: the B-movie actor astronauts useâ) to the awkwardness of a clinch between an aging cop and a starlet (âIf you ever wondered what it would be like to watch your dad make out with a hooker, sit back and enjoyâ). Their more than six hundred jokes included the mashups âThat Seventies Shogunâ and âThe Jackson Pollock Five,â and invoked Thomas the Tank Engine, R.E.M. lyrics, the Fonz, bird flu, Lee Harvey Oswald, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NASCAR"],", and Pantene. The rapt, devotional quality of the audienceâs laughter made it feel like a Phish concert, only enjoyable."],["p","The group explained backstage that jokes are allotted according to each comedianâs strengths: Hodgson gets the run-on musings, Frank Conniff the screams and non sequiturs, Trace Beaulieu the character impressions, J. Elvis Weinstein the songs and truck sounds. âAlso, you do a really good barge,â Mary Jo Pehl told Weinstein. âAnd when Mary Jo does men itâs hilarious,â Hodgson said. âLike in tonightâs movie, when Aldo Rayââplaying the aging copââlooks through binoculars at the harbor, and she does his voice-over talking about the boats like a pervert, like, âOh, baby, show Daddy the masts.â â Everyone cracked up at Hodgson (imperceptibly) doing Pehl (impeccably) doing Ray (implausibly) as a peeping Tom."],["p","Hodgson noted that when MST3K began, even displaying the silhouettes of Joel and the robots was provocative: âYouâd never see anything crawling across the screen except severe storm warnings.â Conniff added, âAnd now, every movie thatâs on basic cable or network, suddenly a character from another show walks across and says, âHey, watch âTwo and a Half Menâ!â as youâre trying to watch Fredo get killed on âThe Godfather.â Everything got all meta and confused when âSnakes on a Planeâ came outââin 2006ââand it was marketed as a movie you could go make fun of. What happened to the sincerity?â"],["p","âThere was a big wave of not caring anymore,â Beaulieu said."],["p","When the group started touring, they sought to frame a rationale for Cinematic Titanicâs efforts, something to parallel MST3Kâs conceit that scientists were studying the effect of bad movies on Joelâs brain. Weinstein hazily recalled, âWe were under the Earth because weâd been abducted, or recruited by some corporate overlordââ"],["p","âWe were struggling toward some kind of story,â Hodgson interjected. âBecause we felt that if people are just talking to a movie for no reason theyâre assholes. But it turns out that audiences accept that people can now talk to a movie just because.â"],["p","Weinstein said, âOur âWhy are we doing this?â turned out to be âWe do this for a living.â â"],["p","âAnd because our audiences provide me with the love thatâs so lacking in my life otherwise,â Conniff said."],["p","âFrom a distance and in a group,â Beaulieu clarified."],["p","Weinstein continued, âThereâs no reason to ever quit. I mean, itâs already sad. Look at usâaging, fat, balding.â He threw up his hands cheerfully. âSo what the hell.â"],["p","On December 30th, after six years, Cinematic Titanic performed its final show; the group finally got sick of it. As Conniff said at the Best Buy Theatre, âIt kills my spirit a little to know that Iâve watched âSanta Claus Conquers the Martiansâ more than Iâve watched âCitizen Kane.âÂ âÂ â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/color-commentary-2","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7636cecf40192141bd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Theatre","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"theatre"},{"id":"5c2e1dd7ee7fe02cbd163472","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tours","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tours"},{"id":"5c2e1c8d7e716b454591adc2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV Shows","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tv-shows"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59113a7276b9ca4b4bbd158c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59113a7276b9ca4b4bbd158c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Pictures","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-pictures"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"The Pictures","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"the-pictures"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Theatre","url":"/tag/theatre"},{"name":"Tours","url":"/tag/tours"},{"name":"TV shows","url":"/tag/tv-shows"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Tad Friend","type":"author","title":"Tad Friend has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998.

months, headlining bigger venues each time: the Slipper Room, Bowery Ballroom, Webster Hall. This week, he and the same drummer and bassist heâs toured with all year come to Terminal 5, a forbidding three-story space near Eleventh Avenue that evokes a concrete opera house. Wherever Bugg plays, and whatever the size of the crowdâwhether heâs in a small room, solo, or opening for the Rolling Stones at Hyde Park with his bandâhis presence is the same: hardworking, laconic, and polite, all his energy channelled into his music, which ranges from folk to skiffle to rock. Heâs not a dancer or a vamper or even a head-bobber, and he doesnât tell stories between songs. He just plays, sings, switches guitars as needed, drinks water, and thanks the crowd and his hosts, in his Midlands accent. âI donât drink or smoke anything before I go on. Itâs kind of a reward after you finishâyou have a beer or whatever,â he said recently."],["p","Bugg doesnât act like a rock star, but his fans act like he is. At Webster Hall, in September, men and women of all ages, some British, some not, danced and yelled âYeah, Jakie!â and hoisted their beer cups in the air, toasting him from afar; they screamed after hearing gentle ballads; on the street after the show, a group of young men chanted âWe saw Bugg!â as they walked away."],["p","Buggâs style has an immediate appeal, melodic and unself-conscious, that sounds like a natural expression of who he is; you can enjoy his music without being distracted by anxieties about the state of modern pop music and the problem of authenticity. He grew up with his mother on a council estate in Nottingham, listening to what she put on around the houseâclassical, boy bands, Vangelisâand didnât discover music that inspired him until he was twelve, when he heard âVincent,â by Don McLean, on âThe Simpsons.â"],["p","He learned to play the guitar, listened to Buddy Holly and Jimi Hendrix, and wrote songs for a few years, and recorded his first album, âJake Bugg,â at seventeen; it went to No. 1 in the U.K. In November, he released his second, âShangri La,â which was recorded in Malibu and produced by Rick Rubin, and features Chad Smith, of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, on drums. Some parts of the album are catchy and aggressive, others melancholy and tender. Bugg sings about the council estate, beauty, muggings, crows, and love, and there are hints about the life heâs earned beyond Nottingham. On the upbeat ballad âMe and You,â he sings, âIâll hold you with such delicacy, no they wonât catch you and me,â and âIâll hide you discreetly, discreetly from this cold world.â Heâs referring to fame, no doubt, but he doesnât sound smugâhe could be any teen in any town, wanting to do his own thing.

one morning in November, five hundred clinicians gathered at the Philadelphia Airport Marriott for the twenty-third annual Renfrew Center Foundation conference, devoted to the understanding and treatment of eating disorders. The keynote speaker, Jennifer Weiner, the best-selling novelist, was there to offer a personal perspective on weight issues, with a talk entitled âThe F Word: On Growing Up Big, Speaking Out Loud and Raising Betty Friedan Girls in a Britney Spears World.â"],["p","The Renfrew foundationâs Web site described Weinerâs 2001 dÃ©but, âGood in Bed,â now in its fifty-seventh printing, as âthe first âchick-litâ novel featuring a large protagonist.â The character, Cannie Shapiro, established the template for a number of Weinerâs subsequent heroines: clever, quippy young women whose dress size tends to be well into the double digits. Her characters navigate the perils presented by lacklustre boyfriends or disappointing husbands, slender mean girls, dysfunctional families, and self-esteem issues. âNobodyâs going to date me looking like this,â Cannie tells the tall, handsome, kindly doctor who interviews her for a weight-loss study. âIâm going to die alone, and my dogâs going to eat my face, and no one will find us until the smell seeps out under the door.â Despite their travails, Weinerâs heroines arrive at happy endings that defy cultural prejudices while upholding the implausible conventions of a Hollywood romantic comedy. (Cannieâs tall, handsome, kindly doctor falls madly in love with her.) Weinerâs second novel, âIn Her Shoes,â was actually made into a romantic comedy, in 2005; it starred Toni Collette, as the brainy, full-figured heroine, and Cameron Diazâfeatured prominently on movie postersâas her skinny, feckless sister."],["p","Weiner, who is forty-three, was outfitted as if for a cocktail party, in a scarlet sleeveless dress and nude stilettos. Her makeup had been applied, before dawn, by a professional; her long, dark-brown hair was loose and shiny. She looked pretty and polished but approachable, like a co-host on âThe View.â Weiner, who has a degree in English literature from Princeton, is cognizant of the expectations that attend a writer of commercial womenâs fiction. âHandbags are important signifiers,â she told me. (Lately, she has leaned heavily on an orange Givenchy tote.) Her outfit projected confidence, but it also gave her an opportunity to reveal a winning vulnerability. After ascending the podium, she began, âGood morning, Renfrew Center clinicians and therapists. Or, as I have been affectionately referring to you in my head, the people I donât need to wear Spanx for.â"],["p","Weiner is a witty public speaker. âSheâs like Kathy Griffin,â the novelist Curtis Sittenfeld, who is a friend of Weinerâs, says. âShe definitely deserves her own reality show.â Weiner devoted much of her speech to recounting a childhood in Simsbury, Connecticut, where her looks and her sense of humor were unappreciated. She described herself as âa beaky, busty, mouthy kid in a Dorothy Hamill bob . . . looking ungainly in an unflattering Esprit shirt-and-vest combination.â When the audience laughed, Weiner ad-libbed, âDonât act like you donât remember the eighties! ",["em","Bitches"],".â She spoke of travelling to Israel the summer she was fifteen. âThere I am in the Promised Land, and there were five Jennifers on this trip, so I became the fat Jennifer,â she said. âHere I am in this part of the world famous for its suffering, and Iâm, like, âNo one has suffered more than me.â â"],["p","With comic triumph, Weiner shared other anecdotes of being marginalized, the kinds of stories that therapists are accustomed to hearing in their consulting rooms. She also spoke about experiencing a more rarefied form of exclusion. In the spring of 2013, she explained, Claire Messud, the novelist, published her first book in seven years, âThe Woman Upstairs.â Widely praised, it features a protagonist, Nora Eldridge, who becomes obsessively involved with her neighborsâa married couple and their sonâwhose domestic and professional contentment she seeks to partake in and disrupt."],["p","Weiner described Nora Eldridge as âa twist on a familiar type: the Unhappy Singleton.â Messud, rather than representing Noraâs misfortunes as screwball comedy, and sending her on bad blind dates and the like, had created âa curdled version of Bridget Jones, notable mostly for her anger.â Weiner had been particularly bothered by Messudâs response to an interviewer who had suggested that Nora Eldridge was not the kind of character a reader might want to befriend. âIf youâre reading to find friends, youâre in deep trouble,â Messud had replied, citing other fictional characters who were not B.F.F. material: Humbert Humbert, Mickey Sabbath, Hamlet, Oedipus, Antigone, Raskolnikov."],["p","âNovels were absolutely, positively not there to serve the petty function of helping people feel connected,â Weiner went on. âAnd if you believed thatâif you wrote that way, or if you read that wayâthen, by God, you were Doing Reading Wrong.â Messudâs comments had left Weiner with âa sinking heart, and an unhappy sense of recognition. Once again, as a reader and a writer, I was out of step, out of

Weiner has two audiences. One consists of the devoted consumers of her books, which have sold more than four and a half million copies. As Melissa Byers, a blogger, puts it, the novels are âfilled with humor, touching moments, heartwarming scenes, and endings I adore.â Weinerâs books have spent two hundred and forty-nine weeks on the ",["em","Times"]," best-seller list, and more than fourteen thousand readers have rated her most recent novel, âThe Next Best Thing,â on Goodreads. Weiner accommodates the demand for her books with hard work and good cheer: âAll Fall Down,â her eleventh book in thirteen years, comes out this spring, and she supplies an e-book short story every Halloween, writes magazine articles, and maintains a chatty blog. (âMy kids started school. Then they both got lice. I feel like my life has been an endless cycle of combing, rinsing, washing, and calling the professional nit-pickers.â) Weiner has almost eighty thousand followers on Twitter, to whom she live-tweets âThe Bachelorâ and âThe Bachelorette.â"],["p","Her other audience is made up of writers, editors, and critics. Through her blog and her Twitter account, Weiner has stoked a lively public discussion about the reception and consumption of fiction written by women. This audience is smaller than the one that buys her books, and barely intersects with it. Yet social media have given Weiner a parallel notoriety, as an unlikely feminist enforcer. [cartoon id=\"a17959\"]"],["p","Weiner has waged a campaign against the literary media for being biased against female writers, and against books written for women. (She has never been reviewed in the ",["em","Times"],".) In 2010, when Jonathan Franzenâs âFreedomâ was published, Weiner and Jodi Picoult, another best-selling novelist, objected to the attention garnered by Franzen and his work, which Weiner termed âFranzenfreude.â (Weiner started but didnât finish âFreedom.â âI got about halfway through the Pattyâs diary section, and then I realized that a female author would get crucified for attempting to write in a male voice that sounded so utterly inauthentic,â she says. âThat, plus my typical Franzen issueâthe endless contempt he seems to have for all his charactersâmade me put it down.â) On her blog, Weiner criticized Jeffrey Eugenides for dismissing Picoultâs complaints as âbelly-achingâ; earlier Weiner had created an ad for one of her own books which spoofed the promotional campaign for Eugenidesâs novel âThe Marriage Plot.â It showed Weiner in a dashing vest of the sort that Eugenides has been seen to wear, and read, âJeffrey Eugenides doesnât have a book out this summer, but Jennifer Weiner has: âThe Next Best Thing.â â"],["p","In the fall of 2012, the journalist Andrew Goldman, in his interview column for the ",["em","Times Magazine"],", asked Tippi Hedren if she had ever been tempted to use the casting couch for career advancement. Weiner tweeted, âSaturday am. Iced coffee. NYT mag. See which actress Andrew Goldman has accused of sleeping her way to the top. #traditionsicoulddowithout.â Goldman unwisely tweeted back, âLittle Freud in me thinks you would have liked at least to have had opportunity to sleep way to top,â and, though he apologized to Weiner, he was temporarily suspended from the ",["em","Times"],". Even Weiner seems to have been shocked by the fallout. âI ",["em","never"]," sought to get him fired or suspended,â she told me. After Alexander Nazaryan referred to her in a column for Atlantic Wire as âstrident,â she tweeted, âMen with opinionsâeven sharply-worded onesâdonât get treated like this,â and âWhose voices do we lose when women who speak up get slapped with âstridentâ and told to be âquietâ?â Nazaryan, who had previously characterized the male critic D. G. Myers as strident without generating offense, withdrew the adjective. âI think you can make a case that, yes, Iâm strident, although itâs not my favorite word,â Weiner now says. âI cringe and I flash back to Bella Abzug and the hats.â"],["p","Last spring, the ",["em","Times"]," appointed Pamela Paul, an editor and writer known for her attention to gender issues, to run the ",["em","Times Book Review"],". The move was seen, in part, as a response to complaints, by Weiner and others, about the underrepresentation of women in its pages. For the past three years, an organization called ",["em",{"class":"small"},"VIDA"]," has tallied the number of books reviewed and written by women in publications ranging from the ",["em","Book Review"]," to this magazine, and its statistics have confirmed a significant gender imbalance. Last September, the ",["em","Book Review"]," announced that it was introducing a new column, âThe Shortlist,â featuring capsule reviews of books grouped by theme or genre. The first was devoted to âDifficult Women,â and included reviews of books by Terry McMillan and Chelsea Cain, whose books had previously been reviewed in the ",["em","Times"],", and the historical-romance writer Nicole Galland, whose books had not. (The reviewer, Alex Kuczynski, compared Gallandâs reimagining of Lady Godiva to âa scheming, chortling Samantha from âSex and the City.â â) Weiner does not take credit for changes at the ",["em","Book Review"],", but she does take satisfaction in them. âMaybe they are doing focus groups, and lots of people are, like, âCould you please not write all the time about whatever Presidential biography you are reviewing for the second time?â â she says. âI would love to believe that I had something to do with it, but I have no idea. They are certainly not writing me thank-you notes.â (In an e-mail, Paul wrote, âAs the last free-standing newspaper book review in the country, we feel all the more responsible about covering the territory, and meeting our readers where they are, which means not only the high and the low, but also the vast middle.â)"],["p","Weiner also promotes other female writers. Her tweets drew attention to Jami Attenbergâs affecting novel âThe Middlesteins,â which features a morbidly obese protagonist and reached the best-seller lists in 2012. â(âgod I fucking love you. Fairy godmother status,â Attenberg tweeted at Weiner.) Weiner also helped launch âThe Opposite of Me,â by Sarah Pekkanen, a story of twin sisters, one smart and responsible, the other reckless and beautiful. She and Pekkanen share an editor, Greer Hendricks, at Atria Books. Hendricks told me, âI asked Jen if she would mention Sarahâs book on Facebook, and she said, âI will do better than that.â â On her Web site, Weiner offered to give a signed copy of one of her own books to readers who could prove that they had pre-ordered Pekkanenâs. âMy author, who was ranked a millionth on Amazon, started climbing the ranks,â Hendricks recalls."],["p","Weiner has also been outspoken about female writers whom she considers unsisterly. When Meg Wolitzer told an interviewer that she was disturbed by a rise in âslumber party fictionâas though the characters are stand-ins for your best friends,â Weiner responded that âlikableâ had become the ânew code wordâ for fiction previously disparaged as chick lit. Adelle Waldman, the author of âThe Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.,â told Salon that she âdidnât want to write a book with a plucky heroine.â Later, Weiner tweeted an oblique, wounded gibe: âGirl writes about kissing from male POV, in Brooklyn, with artsy cover and impressive blurbs. Then itâs literature.â"],["p","Wolitzerâs comment was part of a larger discussion about the way that the book industry treats women writers: at one point, she lamented that publishers put dreamy covers on books by women even when their contents are less than dreamy. In Waldmanâs novel, a female friend of the protagonist makes a persuasive argument: âDating is probably the most fraught human interaction there is.Â .Â .Â . Itâs meritocracy applied to personal life, but thereâs no accountability. We submit ourselves to these intimate inspections and simultaneously inflict them on others and try to keep our psyches intact.Â .Â .Â . But who cares, right? Itâs just girl stuff.â Nevertheless, Weiner believes that these writers are guilty of a tactical betrayal: âEvery time a woman finally ascends to that level of âIâm up here with the big boys,â it feels like, too often, what she does is turn around and throw shade on commercial works of fiction.â"],["p","Erica Jong admires Weinerâs willingness to risk personal attack and institutional unpopularity. Weiner recently wrote a new introduction to Jongâs 1973 book, âFear of Flying,â and, at a joint reading last October in Brooklyn, Jong said, âFor the first time, we have a woman editor of the New York ",["em","Times"],", we have a woman editor of the ",["em","Book Review"]," who is pro-women, we have women rising into these positions. But that doesnât mean they wonât try to bend over backwards to hate their own gender. It is still easier to fight for MalalaââMalala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl who defied a ban on female educationââthan it is for Jen Weiner.â [cartoon id=\"a17967\"]"],["p","Some critics have suggested that Weinerâs purpose in such debates is less to champion the writing of women than to champion the work of Jennifer Weiner. In Salon, Daniel DâAddario wrote that Weinerâs critique of Messud âcannily tilted a conversation on its axisâ to insure that she became the focus of attention. In the comments sections of online publications, cheap reference is sometimes made to Weinerâs surname, which is pronounced âwhiner.â On one occasion, when Weiner suggested in an interview with the Huffington Post that her fiction deserved as much attention as that of Carl Hiaasen, she was mocked. âI had to call my mom and be, like, âDonât read the comments!â â she says. âI mean, I love Carl Hiaasenâs work, but you would have thought I was comparing myself to Chaucer.â"],["p","Weiner says that she would relinquish her role as an ombudsman of publishing-world sexism if a writer with a more literary reputation took on the job. âBut I imagine they have more to lose than I do,â she says. âIf some literary woman were to be known as a gadfly, or a crank, evenâsomebody who wonât shut up, somebody who is persistent and abrasiveâthat could hurt her, careerwise.â Weinerâs provocations, though, have arguably helped her career, giving her a voice in cultural conversations that her books alone might not have granted her. Franzen recently published an essay in the ",["em","Guardian"]," in which he decried the effect of social media on the practice of serious literature; he made a reference to âJennifer Weiner-ish self-promotion.â Weiner says that her reaction was âeighty per cent indignation and twenty per cent âHoly shit, Jonathan Franzen knows who I am.â It was kind of thrilling, in a pathetic way.â For a while, she changed her Twitter bio to âEngaging in Jennifer Weiner-ish

lives in an attractive residential district of Philadelphia that resembles brownstone Brooklyn in all but its property values: row houses, tree-lined streets, stroller-filled playgrounds. Her large, handsome home is a former schoolhouse; there once were separate entrances for boys and girls, and when she bought the house, eight years ago, Weiner joked about reinstating them. The place is tastefully decorated, with an enormous kitchen, comfortable sitting rooms, and art that Weiner bought from galleries on Cape Cod, where she has a summer home. She shares the house with her two daughters, who are ten and six, and her boyfriend, Bill Syken, an affable former reporter and editor for ",["em","Sports Illustrated"],". Lately, he has been editing a collection of calendar shots from the magazine, a project that amuses Weiner in spite of her feminist sensibilities. âI told him to make sure itâs printed on waterproof paper,â she says. Weiner has been amicably separated from her husband, Adam Bonin, a political-law attorney, since 2010. âWe expected that things would proceed one wayâheâd be the primary breadwinner, a successful attorney, and Iâd make less money, stay home with the kids, with fiction essentially a lucrative hobby,â she says. âWhen it didnât work out that way, I think we both had a hard time rewriting the contract of the marriage.â"],["p","Weiner works in what she refers to as a closet, though it may be bigger than some of the apartments occupied by struggling writers in Brooklyn. Lit by a large window and painted pale blue, with a lofty ceiling and white shelves, it suggests the boudoir of a Victorian lady of letters. She writes at what the interior designer intended to be a vanity; a big mirror looms a few inches behind her laptop screen. She sits on a delicate stool upholstered in a pastel fabric. Hanging on the closetâs rails are garment bags containing entire outfits, including jewelry, which Weinerâs personal shopper has prepared and tagged to indicate the public event at which they will be worn. One recent purchase is a luxurious camel-hair coat that she ordered from Max Mara after seeing a paparazzi shot of Kim Kardashian wearing one. On Twitter, Weiner referred to it as the Koat."],["p","Her hybrid closet-office was inspired by Stephen King, who, in his book âOn Writing,â advised aspiring writers to place their desks in the corner of a room, so as not to privilege their art over their life. âWorking here helps me remember that writing is work, that itâs not about creating the perfect setting for the Muse to stop by for a visit,â Weiner says. âI roll my eyes when I read about writers who canât work unless they have perfect silence, who tape garbage bags over the windows and put earplugs in their ears and set up pink-noise machines in the corner.â (In a 2001 profile in the ",["em","Times Magazine"],", Franzen told Emily Eakin that, at times, he had resorted to earplugs and a blindfold.) Weiner has no need for the Internet-blocking software used by many writers, among them Zadie Smith, who in the acknowledgments to âNWâ offered thanks to the programs SelfControl and Freedom. Before Weiner became a novelist, she was a journalist. She says, âYouâre writing in a newsroom, where itâs noisy and profane and there are televisions bolted to the ceiling with CNN and MSNBC. You learn to focus.â"],["p","Weiner wrote âGood in Bedâ at night and on weekends while working as an entertainment reporter at the Philadelphia ",["em","Inquirer"],", and her fiction has a ripped-from-the-style-pages quality, tackling such subjects as the evolution of a political wife after her husband is caught philandering, and surrogacy as an infertility-treatment option for the wealthy. She continues to produce at a deadline pace. When completing a first draft, she writes two thousand words a day. Her agent and her editor typically weigh in on the draft; occasionally, characters are entirely reconceived. Weiner gets another set of notes after her second draft. âThose notes are, basically, a whole lot of âGo deeper,â âMore flashbacks,â âMore scenes like this,â â she says. âI will have roughed something in, and they will be, like, âO.K., write this scene more specifically.âÂ â She has a reporterâs tolerance for being edited; as a reader, Weiner has similar editorial instincts. She told me that Waldmanâs âThe Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.â would have been improved by the introduction of another female character who called the protagonist on his limitations. âI kept waiting for someone to say, âNate, thatâs a shitty way to look at women,â â Weiner said. âWhat if heâd had a sister who had, like, an unfortunate complexion, or maybe wasnât the cutest girl?â (Waldman says of the suggestion, âMy aim was to capture my protagonistâs mind-set and to do so in a way that felt fair and accurate. My thinking was that readers could then judge him for themselves.â) [cartoon id=\"a17965\"]"],["p","âGood in Bedâ was partly inspired by Helen Fieldingâs âBridget Jonesâs Diary,â which popularized the genre of chick litâthe hapless and approachable half sibling to what was then called the âshopping and fuckingâ novel. Weiner says of Fieldingâs novel, âI can see that book being taught, fifty years from now, as some sort of psychological snapshot of a moment: what it was like to be female in Britain at that moment, what were the pressures and what were the expectations.â Like Fieldingâs book, âGood in Bedâ featured a single, urban, working woman whose romantic life and habits of material consumption are mined for comedy. An entertainment reporter at a newspaper, Cannie Shapiro discovers that an ex-boyfriend has landed a relationships column in a menâs magazine; his first piece is titled âLoving a Larger Woman.â (âWhen I met C., I fell for her wit, her laugh, her sparkling eyes. Her body, I decided, was something I could learn to live with.â) Weinerâs prose is breezy, and her humor is often well observed. A teen-age guest at a Thanksgiving dinner, who has a nose ring through his septum, has âthe look of a baffled Jewish bull.â The brand of wish fulfillment expressed by the book is sometimes peculiarly distinctive to Weinerâs profession: after Cannie is blown off by a celebrityâs publicist just before an interview, she finds the celebrity in the hotelâs bathroom, befriends her, and sells her on a screenplay. Cannie not only finds love with a far more deserving man than the magazine columnist; she also discovers that getting thin makes her miserable, and that sheâs happierâmore herself, more lovableâwhen sheâs plump. The weight-loss doctor, a sketchily drawn fantasy figure, heartily agrees. On the bookâs penultimate page, he tells her, âI think you look like a queen.â"],["p","Still, the novel is darker than its premise suggests. Early in the book, the father of Cannieâs ex-boyfriend dies; she pays a shivah call that takes an unexpected turn, and she becomes pregnant. She contemplates getting an abortionââa no-brainer, a $500 afternoon in the doctorâs office, a few days of cramps and crying, end of story,â Weiner writesâbut dismisses the option. (A surprising number of Weinerâs lonely, worthy heroines become accidentally pregnant, and are redeemed by the birth of a child.) Cannieâs baby is born prematurely, which leads to an emergency hysterectomy. The most vivid writing is in the final third of the novel, where Cannie descends into postpartum depression: âI walked and walked, and it was as if God had fitted me with special glasses, where I could only see the bad things, the sad things, the pain and misery of life in the city, the trash kicked into corners instead of the flowers planted in window boxes.â"],["p","In Weinerâs other novels, too, a sometimes uneasy balance is maintained between light comedy and heavier themes. âIn Her Shoesâ charts the problematic relationship of two sisters: Rose, the older, clever, heavy one, who works as a lawyer, and Maggie, the younger, thin, pretty one, who suffers from learning disorders and works as a waitress while struggling to become a performer. Weinerâs sister, Molly, who is now a singer and a comedienne, suffered from learning disabilities, and Weinerâs depictions of Maggieâs difficulties are often acutely drawn. After Maggie experiences a sexual encounter that verges on date rapeâanother motif in Weinerâs storiesâshe senses âhow slippery a thing her own power was, how fast it could turn in her hands, like a knife in the sink, slick with soap, how quickly and deeply the blade could cut her.â Maggieâs eventual career success, as a personal shopper, is much less interesting. Sometimes the reversals of fortune and the discoveries of love in Weinerâs books can feel forced, given the anger and hurt that precede them. Her characters can appear to be mouthing lines they have read in self-help books rather than expressing authentic emotions. It often seems that inside these calculatedly lightweight books there is a more anguished, and possibly truer, work trying to get out."],["p","âGoodnight Nobody,â Weinerâs fourth best-seller, is a cartoonish satire. Its protagonist, Kate Klein, an acid-tongued former reporter, is a bored stay-at-home mother in the suburbs. When a female neighbor is murdered, her response is less fear than excitement, and she turns amateur detective. In a departure, Weiner provides no tidy ending: the book concludes with Kate traumatized, and torn between her husband and an ex-boyfriend. âI wanted to see what it was like to write ",["em","literature"],",â Weiner says. âNot that anybody perceived it that way. But at this point in my career I could write the Odyssey and people would say, âChick lit in Greece.ââ â Some readers hated the bookâs inconclusiveness, and wrote to Weiner to complain. She didnât like the ending much, either. In later novels, she decided to âgive my characters the thing that none of us get, which is the promise that itâs going to be O.K.â Weiner describes her books as modern fairy tales that provide the satisfactions she sought as a teen-ager, when books such as âShining Throughâ and âAlmost Paradise,â by Susan Isaacs, helped her imagine a happier future. âThere is so much antipathy today toward the idea of fiction existing for pleasure or escapism,â she says. âI just have a very hard time seeing entertainment as a bad thing. The things that come up again and again in my books, like a man who thinks that you are beautiful just as you are: is that sentimental, wish-fulfillment bullshit that isnât ever going to happen in real life? I feel like itâs something that we want, and I believe in it, even if it is

the likability scale, Weiner is closer to Bridget Jones than to Messudâs Nora Eldridge. Warm, funny, and frank, she can also be charmingly self-deprecating. âMy assistant just sent me a packing list,â she e-mailed me before an out-of-town event. âThe list includes underwear. I donât know who I am any more.â But her humor can be aggressive. One day, she told me about a passage that she was working on: âThere is a husband and wife, and they are not getting along, and every time the wife looks at the husband she thinks that heâs looking at her like heâs trying to figure out how he can set her hair on fire. My editor is, like, âThat is a horrible thing for someone to be thinking!â And I am, like, âI think people think that way sometimes.â Not all the time, not everyone. But who hasnât wanted to set somebodyâs hair on fire? Who hasnât wanted to kill her husband and make it look like a shaving accident? You?â My face must have betrayed a lack of kinship with this sorority. âYou wouldnât want him dead every once in a while?â she said. âOr maybe justÂ .Â .Â .Â away?â"],["p","When writers ask Weiner for career advice, she tells them that the most important thing is to have had an unhappy childhood. âMine was grim,â she told me one day, over lunch at a restaurant off Rittenhouse Square. The eldest of four, she was bookish and socially isolated. Her mother, Fran Weiner, recalls, âShe was always reading. She would get off the school bus reading a book, with one shoe on and one shoe left on the bus.â There were few other Jewish families in their neighborhood. âAt Christmas, you looked down our street and it would be full-on decorations in the yard, tree lights, a playable Santa on the roof, and then our house would be blank,â Weiner says. âIt would be the missing tooth in the smile of the neighborhood.â Her mother, Weiner says, was consumed with feeding and clothing the family, and didnât notice that she was friendless and unhappy; her father, a child psychiatrist, had different priorities. âHe read to meâShakespeare, the Aeneid,â she says. âHe cared about books, and he cared about learning.â But she felt valued by him only when she achieved academic success. [cartoon id=\"crawford-2011-07-04\"]"],["p","When she was fifteen, her parents announced that they were getting a divorce. âI had friends whose parents had got divorced, and what would happen is the dad would move to a condo in townâthere was a condo complex where a lot of them washed upâand you would see your dad on weekends, and he would very diligently show up at your soccer games or your crew meets,â she says. âMy dad just left, and really renounced us. He said he didnât want to be married, but he also didnât want to be a father anymore. He was just gone.â In âGood in Bed,â Cannieâs father tells her âthat he wanted to be less like a father, more like an uncle,â the words that Weinerâs father said to her and her siblings as he made his exit. Fran Weiner says, âI would say he had a psychotic break and he never got put back together. He floundered. I think he lost control of things. It was depressing and sad and bewildering.â Later, Weiner discovered that her father had abused drugs and alcohol. At one point, he went to prison for failure to pay child support."],["p","At Princeton, she took a seminar with John McPhee, writing nonfiction pieces in which she included her sister Molly as a comic foil. Upon graduation, Weiner followed McPheeâs advice to work at a local newspaper, becoming a reporter in State College, Pennsylvania. Her father attended her graduation, but she rarely saw him otherwise. In 2001, after âGood in Bedâ became a best-seller, the Hartford ",["em","Courant"]," ran an article about her; upon seeing it, he called her and asked for money."],["p","âI asked him if he was in treatment, and he got really mad, and yelled at me and called me names and hung up the phone,â Weiner says. It was the last time that she spoke with him, though he showed up at a group reading a few years later. âOne rule of doing a reading is, Donât ever call on the crazy homeless person,â Weiner says. âBut this other novelist at the reading was, like, âSir?â And my dad stands up and delivers this screed about the nature of art, and how art comes from suffering, and because he caused me to suffer I owe him everything and lots of money.â He died five years ago, from an overdose. âI didnât really imagine, like, ",["em","crack"],",â she says. âIt is not something you tend to think about when your dadâs a doctor, and you grow up in a nice suburb in Connecticut.â After her fatherâs death, Weiner discovered that he had another young son, now nine, whom she has been helping to support."],["p","Weiner has also taken literary inspiration from her mother: when Jennifer was in her mid-twenties, Fran Weiner came out as a lesbian, as does Cannie Shapiroâs mother. Given Weinerâs interest in countering stereotypes of women, her depiction of lesbians in âGood in Bedâ is surprising. The girlfriend of Cannieâs mother is a gruff-voiced stereotype, a swimming coach âwith an aureole of frizzy reddish hair and skin tanned the color and consistency of old leatherâ; she weaves for a hobby, and hangs a rainbow-patterned sun catcher in her window. Weiner says of her motherâs revelation, âIt wasnât so much being squicked out by the gayness. It was more like âOur mom is passionately in love with somebody who is much younger.â Whether or not it had been a man or a woman, just that idea that there is sex happening was, like, âHoly shit!â â A later novel, âThen Came You,â features a more nuanced lesbian character, a Princeton graduate who has donated her eggs to make money."],["p","Other Weiner novels include cultural and media allusions that she has planted for the amusement of a fraction of her readersâor, possibly, only for her own. In âCertain Girls,â Weiner revisits Cannie Shapiro, now the author of a novel that makes it onto the ",["em","Times"]," best-seller list. âThe cover piece was a review of a 160-page short-story collection, âBudapest Nights,â by Daniel Furstmann Friedlander, whoâd been written up the week before in a ten-page profile in the New Yorker that had made much of his boyish good looks and charming Russian accent,â Weiner writes. âGood in Bedâ appeared on the ",["em","Times"]," best-seller list in the spring of 2002, around the time that A. O. Scott compared Gary Shteyngartâs novel âThe Russian Debutanteâs Handbookâ to âa precisely measured map drawn by one of Nabokovâs whimsical madmen.â"],["p","One villain of âGoodnight Nobody,â a conservative columnist who writes about the perfidies of working mothers, is transparently based on Caitlin Flanagan, a contributor to ",["em","The Atlantic"],". Weinerâs columnist is âa flat-chested androgynous sprite the size of a starving fifth grader,â and âher obligatory blond tresses, dyed the color of straw, had been blown out and sprayed until her entire head looked like it had been stuck under a broiler and crisped.â She created the character after her first daughter was born; she found staying home unfulfilling, and, when she came across an essay by Flanagan exalting motherhood over work, she felt personally attacked. In Weinerâs most recent novel, âThe Next Best Thing,â which is set in Hollywood, an interviewer for the ",["em","Times Magazine"]," asks a comedienne if she slept her way to the top. This prompts Weinerâs heroine to wonder whether the interviewer âhad a sitcom or a novel or a screenplay in a box under his bed that heâd tried to sell and couldnât, whether he reflexively hated anyone whoâd gotten what he wanted, or whether it was just the women he loathed.â It seems possible that a forthcoming Weiner novel will include a female writer of literary fictionâquite possibly slender and severely attractiveâwho will say something dismissive about chick lit, and who will wind up garotted with a pair of Spanx."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%201856%2C%20Marian%20Evans%2C%20the%20critic%20and%20editor%20who%20later%20became%20known%20as%20the%20novelist%20George%20Eliot%2C%20published%20an%20essay%20in%20the%20%3Cem%3EWestminster%20Review%3C%2Fem%3E%20called%20%E2%80%9CSilly%20Novels%20by%20Lady%20Novelists.%E2%80%9D%20At%20first%20glance%2C%20it%20appears%20to%20be%20a%20sardonic%20attack%20on%20the%20Victorian%20equivalent%20of%20chick%20lit%E2%80%94the%20throwing%20of%20shade%20at%20popular%20works%20that%20Eliot%20excoriates%20for%20having%20sentimental%20plots%2C%20one-dimensional%20characters%2C%20and%20impoverished%20language.%20Such%20authors%2C%20Eliot%20wrote%2C%20%E2%80%9Chave%20the%20peculiar%20impartiality%20of%20reproducing%20both%20what%20they%20%3Cem%3Ehave%3C%2Fem%3E%20seen%20and%20heard%2C%20and%20what%20they%20have%20%3Cem%3Enot%3C%2Fem%3E%20seen%20and%20heard%2C%20with%20equal%20unfaithfulness.%E2%80%9D%20In%20light%20of%20Eliot%E2%80%99s%20later%20career%2C%20it%20is%20clear%20that%20her%20critique%20of%20such%20clich%C3%A9s%20helped%20her%20work%20out%20what%20might%20constitute%20a%20more%20legitimate%20approach%20to%20fiction%2C%20by%20determining%20what%20did%20not%20count%20as%20literature.%20But%20the%20essay%20also%20identifies%20a%20larger%20problem%3A%20when%20women%20publish%20clich%C3%A9-ridden%20novels%2C%20they%20encourage%20men%20to%20maintain%20condescending%20views%20of%20women.%20%E2%80%9CWe%20believe%20that%20the%20average%20intellect%20of%20women%20is%20unfairly%20represented%20by%20the%20mass%20of%20feminine%20literature%2C%E2%80%9D%20Eliot%20wrote.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%5Bcartoon%20id%3D%26quot%3Bdernavich-2011-06-27%26quot%3B%5D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EA%20novel%20that%20tells%20of%20the%20coming%20of%20age%20of%20a%20young%20woman%20can%20command%20as%20much%20respect%20from%20the%20literary%20establishment%20as%20any%20other%20story.%20In%202013%2C%20Rachel%20Kushner%20was%20nominated%20for%20a%20National%20Book%20Award%20for%20her%20hard-edged%20exploration%20of%20this%20theme%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Flamethrowers%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20the%20previous%20year%20Sheila%20Heti%20won%20accolades%20for%20her%20book%20%E2%80%9CHow%20Should%20a%20Person%20Be%3F%2C%E2%80%9D%20even%20though%20it%20included%20both%20shopping%20and%20fucking.%20The%20novel%2C%20and%20the%20critical%20consensus%20around%20what%20is%20valued%20in%20a%20novel%2C%20has%20never%20excluded%20the%20emotional%20lives%20of%20women%20as%20proper%20subject%20matter.%20It%20could%20be%20argued%20that%20the%20exploration%20of%20the%20emotional%20lives%20of%20women%20has%20been%20the%20novel%E2%80%99s%20prime%20subject.%20Some%20of%20the%20most%20admired%20novels%20in%20the%20canon%20center%20on%20a%20plain%2C%20marginalized%20girl%20who%20achieves%20happiness%20through%20the%20discovery%20of%20romantic%20love%20and%20a%20realization%20of%20her%20worth.%20%E2%80%9CMy%20bride%20is%20here%2C%E2%80%9D%20Mr.%20Rochester%20tells%20Jane%20Eyre%2C%20%E2%80%9Cbecause%20my%20equal%20is%20here%2C%20and%20my%20likeness.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBut%20the%20obligation%20of%20a%20commercial%20novelist%20does%20not%20lie%20merely%20in%20representing%2C%20as%20fully%20as%20possible%2C%20the%20emotional%20lives%20of%20her%20characters.%20It%20also%20lies%20in%20meeting%20the%20demands%2C%20perceived%20or%20expressed%2C%20of%20readers.%20Weiner%E2%80%99s%20readers%E2%80%94who%2C%20on%20the%20Internet%2C%20review%20her%20work%20with%20all%20the%20attentiveness%20it%20has%20not%20received%20from%20the%20%3Cem%3ETimes%3C%2Fem%3E%E2%80%94seek%20out%20her%20latest%20books%20for%20the%20same%20satisfactions%20they%20have%20found%20in%20her%20earlier%20books%2C%20with%20their%20casual%20prose%2C%20happy%20resolutions%2C%20and%20lovable%20heroines.%20It%20is%20unlikely%20that%20literary%20critics%20will%20ever%20applaud%20Weiner%E2%80%99s%20work%20for%20these%20qualities%2C%20because%20literary%20criticism%2C%20at%20its%20best%2C%20seeks%20to%20elucidate%20the%20complex%2C%20not%20to%20catalogue%20the%20familiar.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EDuring%20her%20talk%20at%20the%20Renfrew%20conference%2C%20Weiner%20argued%20for%20the%20value%20of%20familiar%20books%2C%20with%20their%20tropes%20of%20self-realization%20and%20rescue.%20And%20she%20defended%20the%20%E2%80%9Cpolitical%20impact%20of%20escapism%2C%E2%80%9D%20having%20written%20her%20first%20book%20%E2%80%9Calmost%20as%20a%20life%20raft%20to%20the%20girl%20I%20had%20once%20been.%E2%80%9D%20She%20continued%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20wanted%20girls%20like%20me%E2%80%94who%20felt%20ugly%2C%20or%20fat%2C%20or%20lonely%2C%20or%20like%20it%20was%20never%20going%20to%20get%20better%E2%80%94to%20be%20able%20to%20read%20something%20and%20think%20maybe%20it%20will.%E2%80%9D%20Why%20do%20we%20read%3F%20Weiner%20asked%20the%20audience.%20%E2%80%9CYes%2C%20to%20understand%20the%20world%2C%20and%2C%20of%20course%2C%20to%20meet%20characters%20tha

1856, Marian Evans, the critic and editor who later became known as the novelist George Eliot, published an essay in the ",["em","Westminster Review"]," called âSilly Novels by Lady Novelists.â At first glance, it appears to be a sardonic attack on the Victorian equivalent of chick litâthe throwing of shade at popular works that Eliot excoriates for having sentimental plots, one-dimensional characters, and impoverished language. Such authors, Eliot wrote, âhave the peculiar impartiality of reproducing both what they ",["em","have"]," seen and heard, and what they have ",["em","not"]," seen and heard, with equal unfaithfulness.â In light of Eliotâs later career, it is clear that her critique of such clichÃ©s helped her work out what might constitute a more legitimate approach to fiction, by determining what did not count as literature. But the essay also identifies a larger problem: when women publish clichÃ©-ridden novels, they encourage men to maintain condescending views of women. âWe believe that the average intellect of women is unfairly represented by the mass of feminine literature,â Eliot wrote."],["p","[cartoon id=\"dernavich-2011-06-27\"]"],["p","A novel that tells of the coming of age of a young woman can command as much respect from the literary establishment as any other story. In 2013, Rachel Kushner was nominated for a National Book Award for her hard-edged exploration of this theme, âThe Flamethrowers,â and the previous year Sheila Heti won accolades for her book âHow Should a Person Be?,â even though it included both shopping and fucking. The novel, and the critical consensus around what is valued in a novel, has never excluded the emotional lives of women as proper subject matter. It could be argued that the exploration of the emotional lives of women has been the novelâs prime subject. Some of the most admired novels in the canon center on a plain, marginalized girl who achieves happiness through the discovery of romantic love and a realization of her worth. âMy bride is here,â Mr. Rochester tells Jane Eyre, âbecause my equal is here, and my likeness.â"],["p","But the obligation of a commercial novelist does not lie merely in representing, as fully as possible, the emotional lives of her characters. It also lies in meeting the demands, perceived or expressed, of readers. Weinerâs readersâwho, on the Internet, review her work with all the attentiveness it has not received from the ",["em","Times"],"âseek out her latest books for the same satisfactions they have found in her earlier books, with their casual prose, happy resolutions, and lovable heroines. It is unlikely that literary critics will ever applaud Weinerâs work for these qualities, because literary criticism, at its best, seeks to elucidate the complex, not to catalogue the familiar."],["p","During her talk at the Renfrew conference, Weiner argued for the value of familiar books, with their tropes of self-realization and rescue. And she defended the âpolitical impact of escapism,â having written her first book âalmost as a life raft to the girl I had once been.â She continued, âI wanted girls like meâwho felt ugly, or fat, or lonely, or like it was never going to get betterâto be able to read something and think maybe it will.â Why do we read? Weiner asked the audience. âYes, to understand the world, and, of course, to meet characters that are alive and visceral. But, at least to me, sometimes we do read to make friends. Sometimes we do read to escape, or find comfort, or to spend time in a world that is a little more fair and a little more kind than the world that we inhabit.â"],["p","The same cultural prejudices that maligned large women, she said, explain why books like hers do not get critical respect. Her campaign about books, she suggested, is more than just a campaign about books: âJust as I want plus-size women visible, and valued, and loved in my books, so do I want books like mine visible and valued, if not loved, by a critical establishment thatâs still too rooted in sexist double standards, still too swift to dismiss womenâs work as small, trivial, unimpressive, and unimportant.â In this analysis, Weinerâs failure to receive critical recognition is not an implicit judgment of, say, the perfunctory quality of some descriptive passages, or of the brittle mean-spiritedness that colors some character sketches. (Readers looking for fairness and kindness will not always find those attributes displayed by Weinerâs fictional creations.) It is, instead, a product of the larger cultural forces that left Weiner feeling oppressed long before she became a writer. To battle those forces as visibly as Weiner does is not just to tell a fairy-tale story but also to try to live one: to insist on moving from the margin to the center, and to demand a happy ending of oneâs own."],["p","After a standing ovation, Weiner went to the lobby to sign books. She kicked off her shoes, tied her hair in a scrunchie, and tucked one foot underneath her on her chair, as a long line of women stepped forward, paperbacks in hand. She took time to talk to everyoneâthe woman whose daughter was struggling with anorexia; the woman who came from Simsbury, Connecticut, and knew her familyâand posed for photographs.

January of 1903, the small Boston magazine ",["em","Handicraft"]," ran an essay by the Harvard professor Denman W. Ross, who argued that the American Arts and Crafts movement was in deep crisis. The movement was concerned with promoting good taste and self-fulfillment through the creation and the appreciation of beautiful objects; its more radical wing also sought to advance worker autonomy. The problem was that no one in America seemed to need its products. The solution, according to Ross, was to provide technical education to the critics and the consumers of art alike. This would stimulate demand for high-quality objects and encourage more workers to take up craftsmanship. The cause of the Arts and Crafts movement would be achieved, he maintained, only âwhen the philosopher goes to work and the working man becomes a philosopher.â"],["p","In a long rebuttal, Mary Dennett, who later became an important advocate for womenâs rights, pointed out that the roots of the problem were economic and moral. Reforming the school curriculum wouldnât do much to change the structural conditions that made craftsmanship impossible. The Arts and Crafts movement was spending far too much time on ârag-rugs, baskets, andÂ .Â .Â .Â exhibitions of work chiefly by amateurs,â rather than asking the most basic questions about inequality. âThe employed craftsman can almost never use in his own home things similar to those he works on every day,â she observed, because those things were simply unaffordable. Economics, not aesthetics, explained the movementâs failures. âThe modern man, who should be a craftsman, but who, in most cases, is compelled by force of circumstances to be a mill operative, has no freedom,â she wrote earlier. âHe must make what his machine is geared to make.â"],["p","Dennettâs tireless social activism bore fruit in other realms, but she lost this fight to aesthetes like Ross. As the historian Jackson Lears describes it in âNo Place of Graceâ (1981), the Arts and Crafts movement no longer represented a radical alternative to the alienated labor of the factories. Instead, it provided yet another therapeutic escape from it, turning into a ârevivifying hobby for the affluent.â Lears concluded, âThe craft impulse has become dispersed in millions of do-it-yourself projects and basement workshops, where men and women have sought the wholeness, the autonomy, and the joy they cannot find on the job or in domestic drudgery.â"],["p","Although the Arts and Crafts movement was dead by the First World War, the sentiment behind it lingered. It resurfaced in the counterculture of the nineteen-sixties, with its celebration of simplicity, its back-to-the-land sloganeering, and, especially, its endorsement of savvy consumerism as a form of political activism. The publisher and sage Stewart Brand was the chief proponent of such views. âThe consumer has more power for good or ill than the voter,â he announced in the pages of his âWhole Earth Catalog,â which dÃ©buted in 1968 and was geared to communalists and others who sought to drop out of the mainstream."],["p","Inspired by the technophilia of his intellectual hero Buckminster Fuller, Brand played a key role in celebrating the personal computer as the ultimate tool of emancipation. He convinced the consumers he celebrated that they were actually far more radical than the student rebels who were being beaten up by the police. At a recent conference, Brand drew a contrast between âwhat happened around Berkeley in the sixties and what happened around Stanford in the sixties,â a contrast that captures the fate of activism in America more broadly:"],["blockquote",["p","Around Berkeley, it was Free Speech Movement, âpower to the people.â Around Stanford, it was âWhole Earth Catalog,â Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, people like that, and they were just power to people. They just wanted to power anybody who was interested, not âthe people.â Well, it turns out there is no, probably, âthe people.â So the political blind alley that Berkeley went down was interesting, we were all taking the same drugs, the same length of hair, but the stuff came out of the Stanford area, I think because it took a Buckminster Fuller access-to-tools angle on things."]],["p","To convince consumers that they were rebels, Brand first convinced them that they were âhackers,â a slang term that was already in use in places like M.I.T. but that Brand went on to popularize and infuse with much wider meaning. In 1972, he published âSpacewar,â a long and much read article in ",["em","Rolling Stone"]," about Stanfordâs Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He distinguished the hackers from the planners, those rigid and unimaginative technocrats, noting that âwhen computers become available to everybody, the hackers take over.â For Brand, hackers were âa mobile new-found elite.â He seemed to have had a transcendental experience in that lab: âThose magnificent men with their flying machines, scouting a leading edge of technology which has an odd softness to it; outlaw country, where rules are not decree or routine so much as the starker demands of whatâs possible.â Computers were the new drugsâwithout any of the side effects."],["p","In a later edition of the âWhole Earth Catalog,â Brand reminisced about its mid-seventies heyday, when it recommended two products: the Vermont Castings Defiant woodstove and the Apple personal computer. The odd juxtaposition made sense to Brand. âBoth cost a few hundred dollars, both were made by and for revolutionaries who wanted to de-institutionalize society and empower the individual.â Yet, while the Defiant woodstove ran into trouble, Apple prosperedâbecause it was in the business of manipulating information, not heat. With information now intruding into every field, Brand held, there was considerably more scope for hacking. And the country was ready for it. His subscribers were more likely to be office workers than factory workers; few were forced to be mill operatives, as in Dennettâs day. But the transition to âcognitive capitalismâ (as some labor theorists would put it) didnât make the workplace less alienating. Brandâs remedy was hacking of a particular kind: âWith over half of the American workforce now managing information for a living, any apparent drone drudging away on mainstream information chores might be recruited, via some handy outlaw techniques or tool, into the holy disorder of hackerdom. A hacker takes nothing as given, everything as worth creatively fiddling with, and the variety which proceeds from that enricheth the adaptivity, resilience, and delight of us all.â"],["p","For all the talk of the âde-institutionalization of societyâ enabled by the personal computer, Brand was brutally honest about the kinds of emancipation that he had to offer. The way to join the holy disorder of hackerdom was by, say, playing Tetrisâand, on weekends, going home and hacking rubber stamps, postcards, and whatever else one had ordered from the âWhole Earth Catalog.â"],["p","Is Brandâs hacking revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary? The plentiful recent books that preach hacking as a way of lifeââReality Hacking,â âHacking Your Education,â âHacking Happinessââexpress devotion at least to the rhetoric of revolt. âHacking Work,â a business book published in 2010, announces that âyou were born to hackâ and suggests ways in which one could âhackâ work to achieve â",["em","morebetterfaster"]," results.â As in most of these books, our hackers arenât smashing the system; theyâre fiddling with it so that they can get more work done. In this vision, itâs up to individuals to accommodate themselves to the system rather than to try to reform it. The shrinking of political imagination that accompanies such attempts at doing more with less usually goes unremarked."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoons%252F593b5d1f3adc75471b34b023%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b5d1f3adc75471b34b023%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoons%2F593b5d1f3adc75471b34b023%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b5d1f3adc75471b34b023"}]],["p","That hacking has come to mean two very different aspirations became evident when Barack Obama belittled Edward Snowden as âa twenty-nine-year-old hackerâ only a few weeks after the White House endorsed the first National Day of Civic Hacking. In Britain, the Metropolitan Police might be busy finding hackers like Snowden, but in April it helped organize âHack the Police!ââa so-called âhackathon,â where software developers and designers were encouraged to bring their âunique talents to the fight against crime.â In contrast to jabbering, feckless politicians, hackers offer hope for the most hopeless endeavors. âIâd like to see the spirit of hackerdom improve peace in the Middle East,â the influential technology publisher and investor Tim OâReilly proclaimed a couple of years

Thatâs the old impulse of basically defying authority and of doing it your way.â Makers, in other words, are the new hackers."],["p","There are already plenty of intellectual entrepreneurs eager to capitalize on the new counterculture. Kevin Kellyâwho used to work with Brand on his many magazinesâhas revived the âWhole Earth Catalogâ tradition with his new catalogue-like publication, âCool Tools.â It features product tips for the true reality hackerâfrom âquick-refreshing underwear for travelâ to the âluxurious, squirting WC seatâ (thermostatically warmed, and yours for just eight hundred dollars). âA third industrial revolution is stirringâthe Maker era,â Kelly writes in the introduction to âCool Tools.â âThe skills for this accelerated era lean toward the agile and decentralized. Therefore tools recommended here are aimed at small groups, decentralized communities, the do-it-yourselfer, and the self-educated.Â .Â .Â .Â These possibilities cataloged here will help makers become better makers.â In his world, the main thing it takes to be a maker is a credit card."],["p","The maker era might not be upon us yet, but the maker movement has arrived. Just who are these people? Like the Arts and Crafts movementâa mÃ©lange of back-to-the-land simplifiers, socialists, anarchists, and tweedy art connoisseursâthe makers are a diverse bunch. They include 3-D-printing enthusiasts who like making their own toys, instruments, and weapons; tinkerers and mechanics who like to customize household objects by outfitting them with sensors and Internet connectivity; and appreciators of craft who prefer to design their own objects and then have them manufactured on demand."],["p","Each of these subgroups has its own history. What turns them into a movement is the intellectual infrastructure that allows makers to reflect on what it means to be a maker. Makers interested in honing their skills can take classes in well-equipped âmakerspaces,â where they can also design and manufacture their wares. Makers have their own widely read publicationâthe magazine ",["em","Make"],"âa cheerleader for âtechnology on your time.â Then there are Maker Fairesâexhibitions dedicated to the celebration of the D.I.Y. mind-set which were pioneered by ",["em","Make"]," and have quickly spread across the country and far beyond, including a Maker Faire Africa. And, as befits a contemporary movement, the makers want respect: a Makerâs Bill of Rights has been drafted. Kelly isnât jesting when he identifies the rise of makers with a third industrial revolution: many promoters of the maker movement believe that personal manufacturing will undermine the clout of large corporations. It might even liberate labor in a way that the Arts and Crafts radicals hadnât anticipated, with office workers abandoning their jobs in pursuit of meaningful self-employment amid sensors and 3-D printers. Meanwhile, the prospect of being able to print guns, drug paraphernalia, and other regulated objects appeals to libertarians."],["p","A proper movement requires more than newsletters and magazines; it also needs manifestos. Chris Anderson, the ",["em","Wired"]," editor-in-chief who quit his job to become the C.E.O. of 3D Robotics, a company that develops personal drones, published one such manifesto, âMakers,â in 2012. More recently, Mark Hatch, the C.E.O. of TechShop, a chain of makerspaces across the country, published âThe Maker Movement Manifesto.â Both books promise a revolution."],["p","Anderson defines âmakingâ so expansively that all of us seem to qualify, at least once a day. âIf you love to plant, youâre a garden Maker. Knitting and sewing, scrap-booking, beading, and cross-stitchingâall Making.â Thereâs nothing in this book about mythmaking, but that surely qualifies as well. For someone who spent more than a decade at the helm of ",["em","Wired"],", Anderson sounds surprisingly unhappy with the virtual turn that our lives have taken. He repeatedly blames screens and personal computers for our lack of contact with physical objects. âThe digital natives are starting to hunger for life beyond the screen,â he writes. âMaking something that starts virtual but quickly becomes tactile and usable in the everyday world is satisfying in a way that pure pixels are not.â Many aesthetes in the early Arts and Crafts debates complained about machines, rather than about the economic conditions under which they were used. Anderson, likewise, sees âpure pixelsâ as the source of discontent, as opposed to the uses to which those pixels are put (the boring spreadsheet, the senseless PowerPoint deck)."],["p","For Anderson, itâs the democratization of inventionâanyone can become an app mogul these daysâthat defines the past two decades of Internet history. Owing to the maker movement, he thinks, the same thing might happen to manufacturing: âÂ âThree guys with laptopsâ used to describe a Web startup. Now it describes a hardware company, too.â Every inventor can become an entrepreneur. Indeed, he anticipates a Web-like future for the maker movement: âever-accelerating entrepreneurship and innovation with ever-dropping barriers to entry.â"],["p","The kind of Internet metaphysics that informs Andersonâs account sees ingrained traits of technology where others might see a cascade of decisions made by businessmen and policymakers. (Would âthe history of the Webâ be the same if the National Science Foundation hadnât relinquished control of the Internet to the private sector in 1995?) This is why Anderson starts by confusing the history of the Web with the history of capitalism and ends by speculating about the future of the maker movement, which, on closer examination, is actually speculation on the future of capitalism. What Anderson envisagesâmore of the same but with greater diversity and competitionâmay come to pass. But to set the threshold for the third industrial revolution so low just because someone somewhere forgot to regulate A.T. & T. (or Google) seems rather unambitious."],["p","In the absence of a savvy political strategy, the maker movement could have even weaker political and social impact than Anderson foresees. One worrying sign appeared in the fall of 2012, when MakerBot, a pioneer in open-source 3-D printing, embraced a controlled, closed model. Then MakerBot was acquired by Stratasys, a big, established manufacturer of 3-D printersâa company that is the opposite of what MakerBot once aspired to be. 3-D printing is raising challenges with respect to copyright and trademark law, and regulatory backlash is inevitable. Some corporations will target the many intermediaries involved in the process, from the manufacturers of 3-D printers to sites hosting the files that users download in order to print an object. Other companies are developing software that would prevent printers from creating components that could be used to assemble a gun. Such a mechanism might control the printing of other artifacts, like the ones that litigious, patent-holding corporations claim a property interest in."],["p","Then there are the temptations facing the movement. Two years ago, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"DARPA"],"âthe research arm of the Department of Defenseâannounced a ten-million-dollar grant to promote the maker movement among high-school students. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"DARPA"]," also gave three and a half million dollars to TechShop to establish new makerspaces that could help the agency with its âinnovation agenda.â As a senior ",["em",{"class":"small"},"DARPA"]," official told ",["em","Bloomberg BusinessWeek"],", âWe are pretty in tune with the maker movement. We want to reach out to a much broader section of society, a much broader collection of brains.â The Chinese government, too, seems to have embraced the makers with open arms. Authorities in Shanghai have announced plans to launch a hundred makerspaces, while the Communist Youth League has been active in recruiting visitors to Maker Fairesâor Maker Carnivals, as they are known in China. One of the co-founders of MakerBot has left New York for Shenzhen. Makers, it appears, are not necessarily troublemakers."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoons%252F593b5d2020855957e69d5247%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b5d2020855957e69d5247%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoons%2F593b5d2020855957e69d5247%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b5d2020855957e69d5247"}]],["p","Mark Hatch, for one, shows no concern that proximity to power might compromise his movementâs revolutionary potential. âNow, with the tools available at a makerspace, anyone can change the world,â he writes in âThe Maker Movement Manifesto.â âEvery revolution needs an army.Â .Â .Â .Â My objective with this book is to ",["em","radicalize"]," you and get you to become a soldier in this army.â How radical is Hatchâs project?

(Describing a woman who became a vender on Etsy after visiting TechShop, Hatch writes, âAn accidental entrepreneur was born. And what was Tinaâs background? She was a labor organizer.â) Like Anderson, Hatch emphasizes how we are all born makers but are everywhere in ready-made chains. We must abandon the virtual and embrace the physicalâpreferably at Hatchâs TechShop."],["p","Hatch and Anderson alike invoke Marx and argue that the success of the maker movement shows that the means of production can be made affordable to workers even under capitalism.

Money goes to those who know how to attract attention."],["p","Simply put, if you need to raise money on Kickstarter, it helps to have fifty thousand Twitter followers, not fifty. It helps enormously if Google puts your product on the first page of search results, and making sure it stays there might require an investment in search-engine optimization.

The good news is that now you donât have to worry about getting fired; the bad news is that you have to worry about getting downgraded by Google."],["p","Hatch assumes that online platforms are ruled by equality of opportunity. But they arenât. Inequality here is not just a matter of who owns and runs the means of physical production but also of who owns and runs the means of intellectual productionâthe so-called âattention economyâ (or what the German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger, in the early sixties, called the âconsciousness industryâ). All of this suggests that thereâs more politickingâand politicsâto be done here than enthusiasts like Anderson or Hatch are willing to acknowledge."],["p","A comparison to the world of original hackersâthe folks that Brand profiled in his ",["em","Rolling Stone"]," article, not the âreality hackersâ of later decadesâmay be illuminating. Itâs a comparison that the makers are fond of. The subtitle of Hatchâs book, tellingly, is âRules for Innovation in the New World of Crafters, Hackers, and Tinkerers.â Anderson pays homage to the Homebrew Computer Clubâa small hobbyist group that, starting in 1975, brought together computer enthusiasts from the Bay Area, including Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. For Anderson, such innovation is the prelude to a great business: when hobbyists cluster together to work on obscure technologies, someone eventually gets rich. But itâs misleading to view the Homebrew Computer Club solely through the prism of innovation and entrepreneurship. It also had, at least at first, a political

of the leaders of the Homebrew Computer Club was Lee Felsenstein. A veteran of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, he wanted to build communication infrastructure that would allow citizens to swap information in a decentralized manner, bypassing the mistrusted traditional media. In the early nineteen-seventies, he helped launch Community Memoryâa handful of computer terminals installed in public spaces in Berkeley and San Francisco which allowed local residents to communicate anonymously. It was the first true âsocial media.â"],["p","Felsenstein got his inspiration from reading Ivan Illichâs âTools for Conviviality,â which called for devices and machines that would be easy to understand, learn, and repair, thus making experts and institutions unnecessary. âConvivial tools rule out certain levels of power, compulsion, and programming, which are precisely those features that now tend to make all governments look more or less alike,â Illich wrote. He had little faith in traditional politics. Whereas Stewart Brand wanted citizens to replace politics with savvy shopping, Illich wanted to âretoolâ society so that traditional politics, with its penchant for endless talk, becomes unnecessary."],["p","Felsenstein took Illichâs advice to heart, not least because it resembled his own experience with ham radios, which were easy to understand and fiddle with. If the computer were to assist ordinary folks in their political struggles, the computer needed a ham-radio-like community of hobbyists. Such a club would help counter the power of I.B.M., then the dominant manufacturer of large and expensive computers, and make computers smaller, cheaper, and more useful in political struggles."],["p","Then Steve Jobs showed up. Felsensteinâs political project, of building computers that would undermine institutions and allow citizens to share information and organize, was recast as an aesthetic project of self-reliance and personal empowerment. For Jobs, who saw computers as âa bicycle for our minds,â it was of only secondary importance whether one could peek inside or program them."],["p","Jobs had his share of sins, but the naÃ¯vetÃ© of Illich and his followers shouldnât be underestimated. Seeking salvation through tools alone is no more viable as a political strategy than addressing the ills of capitalism by cultivating a public appreciation of arts and crafts. Society is always in flux, and the designer canât predict how various political, social, and economic systems will come to blunt, augment, or redirect the power of the tool that is being designed. Instead of deinstitutionalizing society, the radicals would have done better to advocate reinstitutionalizing it: pushing for political and legal reforms to secure the transparency and decentralization of power they associated with their favorite technology."],["p","One thinker who saw through the naÃ¯vetÃ© of Illich, the Homebrewers, and the Whole Earthers was the libertarian socialist Murray Bookchin. Back in the late sixties, he published a fiery essay called âTowards a Liberatory Technology,â arguing that technology is not an enemy of craftsmanship and personal freedom. Unlike Brand, though, Bookchin never thought that such liberation could occur just by getting more technology into everyoneâs hands; the nature of the political community mattered. In his book âThe Ecology of Freedomâ (1982), he couldnât hide his frustration with the âaccess-to-toolsâ mentality. Bookchinâs critique of the countercultureâs turn to tools parallels Dennettâs critique of the aesthetesâ turn to education eighty years earlier. It didnât make sense to speak of âconvivial tools,â he argued, without taking a close look at the political and social structures in which they were embedded."],["p","A reluctance to talk about institutions and political change doomed the Arts and Crafts movement, channelling the spirit of labor reform into consumerism and D.I.Y. tinkering. The same thing is happening to the movementâs successors. Our tech imagination, to judge from catalogues like âCool Tools,â is at its zenith. (Never before have so many had access to thermostatically warmed toilet seats.) But our institutional imagination has stalled, and with it the democratizing potential of radical technologies. We carry personal computers in our pocketsânothing could be more decentralized than this!âbut have surrendered control of our data, which is stored on centralized servers, far away from our pockets. The hackers won their fight against I.B.M.âonly to lose it to Facebook and Google. And the spooks at the National Security Agency must be surprised to learn that gadgets were supposed to usher in the âde-institutionalization of society.â"],["p","The lure of the technological sublime has ruined more than one social movement, and, in this respect, even Mary Dennett fared no better than Felsenstein. For all her sensitivity to questions of inequality, she also believed that, once âcheap electric powerâ is âat every village door,â the âemancipation of the craftsman and the unchaining of artâ would naturally follow. What electric company would disagree?Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/making-it-2","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e20567e716b454591b07c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chris

artists are greedy hucksters who sell us dreams that never come true. But Americans have a soft spot for them. Witness the current success of âThe Wolf of Wall Streetâ and âAmerican Hustle,â films that celebrate (sort of) the art of the grift. Somehow, living through two bubbles in which plenty of investors and homeowners were suckered by sugarplum visions hasnât dampened our appetite for watching spectacles like Christian Bale duping almost everyone he encounters, including F.B.I. agents, and Leonardo DiCaprio hypnotizing a mark into buying worthless stock."],["p","It has ever been thus. The phrase âconfidence manâ was popularized in an 1849 New York ",["em","Herald"]," article detailing the arrest of William Thompson, a man of âgenteel appearanceâ who for months had been approaching strangers on the street and somehow persuading them to trust him with their watches until the next day. (Needless to say, they never got the watches back.) Almost immediately, a play titled âThe Confidence Manâ dÃ©buted; Thompson was soon bragging that he was âa great man in the eyes of the world.â In the decades that followed, the con artist became a classic American antihero. The curious thing, as the University of Pennsylvania historian Walter McDougall writes, is that, âfar from despising flimflam artists as parasites or worse, American popular culture habitually celebrates rascals as comedic figures.â Think of the movies of W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers; think of âThe Stingâ and âDirty Rotten Scoundrels.â Even bleaker depictions, like David Mametâs, get us to admire the dexterity with which con artists persuade people to part with their money."],["p","It seems that con artists, for all their vices, represent many of the virtues that Americans aspire to. Con artists are independent and typically self-made. They donât have to kowtow to a bossâno small thing in a country in which people have always longed to strike out on their own. They succeed or fail based on their wits. They exemplify, in short, the complicated nature of American capitalism, which, as McDougall argues, has depended on people being hustlers in both the positive and the negative sense. The American economy wasnât built just on good ideas and hard work. It was also built on hope and hype."],["p","In the nineteenth century especially, the line between crook and businessman was fuzzy. Take the building of the American railroads, which both spurred industrialization and laid the foundation for a truly national economy. When the Central Pacific Railroad (the western spur of the transcontinental railroad) was built, the four men who started it, including Leland Stanford, set up an outside construction company in which they were the sole shareholders, and used that company to milk the Central Pacific for tens of millions of dollars in excess construction costs. The building of the Union Pacific Railroad led to the same kind of self-dealing and pocket-lining and reckless overbuilding, while railroad financiers like Jay Gould made enormous sums via stock schemes and dubious takeovers. The result was one of the biggest cons the country has ever seen, with huge losses for investors and huge fortunes for the moguls. Still, we ended up with a national transportation system."],["p","In the twentieth century, the relationship between commerce and con artistry became subtler. Never mind the out-and-out scammers, from Charles Ponzi to Bernard Madoff, or the long history of questionable behavior on Wall Street. Entrepreneurs have skills that are very much like those of the con men. To raise money to start a business, youâve got to sell an imagined futureâa dream. Before building a single car, Henry Ford had to persuade his major supplier to take stock in lieu of cash, because he didnât have the money to pay for thousands of dollarsâ worth of parts."],["p","As the sociologist Alex Preda writes, âTalent for persuasion is key: after all, the public must be convinced to part with their money on the basis of the simple promise that an idea will yield profit in the future.â Successful entrepreneurship involves hucksterism, the ability to convince investors and employees that they should risk their money, their time, and their effort on you. Like a con artist, youâre peddling optimism. As Mel Weinberg (the model for Baleâs character in âAmerican Hustleâ) put it in Robert Greeneâs book âThe Sting Man,â âItâs my philosophy to give hope.Â .Â .Â . Thatâs why most people donât turn us in to the cops. They keep hopinâ weâre for real.â"],["p","In a dynamic economy, getting people to wager on unknowable (and often unlikely) futures is essential. The greatest business icon of our era, Steve Jobs, was legendary for his âreality-distortion field,â which allowed him to convince people that improbable outcomes were not just possible but certain. Jobsâs endless rehearsals for his public presentations and his scripting of every moment for maximum effectâthese are all straight from the con artistâs playbook. So, too, is the sense of conviction he projected. In Weinbergâs words, âBefore you sell a deal you have to live the deal. You have to believe in it, because, if you donât believe in it, you canât sell it.â"],["p","Of course, the fundamental difference between entrepreneurs and con artists is that con artists ultimately know that the fantasies theyâre selling are lies. Steve Jobs, often enough, could make those fantasies come true. Still, that unquantifiable mÃ©lange of risk, hope, and hype provides both the capitalistâs formula for transforming the world and the con artistâs stratagem for turning your money into his money. Maybe thereâs a reason we talk about the American Dream.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/do-the-hustle","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7c2710c62d10815412","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Business","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"business"},{"id":"5c2e1cb82710c62d10815482","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Con Artists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"con-artists"},{"id":"5c2e207eee7fe02cbd16364b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Wolf of Wall Street","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-wolf-of-wall-street"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"590a11d32179605b11ad99e0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a11d32179605b11ad99e0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Financial Page","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-financial-page"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"The Financial Page","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"the-financial-page"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Business","url":"/tag/business"},{"name":"Con Artists","url":"/tag/con-artists"},{"name":"The Wolf of Wall Street","url":"/tag/the-wolf-of-wall-street"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"James Surowiecki","type":"author","title":"James Surowiecki is the author of â\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706\">The Wisdom of Crowds\u003c/a>.â","email":"","bio":["div",["p","James Surowiecki wrote ",["em","The New Yorkerâs"]," Financial Page column from 2000 to 2017.Â HeÂ came to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," from Slate, where he wrote the Moneybox column.

Foods, where bits of lamb tongue, nose, and cheek are jumbled up with chili-coated cucumber in a gloriously oily mess. (Perhaps soon weâll see a whole head at Chopât: âCartilage & Crunch.â) And yet itâs still a little bit thrilling to hear that the special at Khe-Yo, a new Laotian restaurant situated amid the baby gyms and branded nail salons of Tribeca, is a pigâs-face salad. Even more so is the fact that the dish turns out to be rich, springy, and bright."],["p","Khe-Yo is not, improbably enough, the only place in the neighborhood with a connection to Laos: a couple of blocks away, Mangez Avec Moi is run by natives of that country, but their menu is more pan-Asian and takeout-focussed. The chef Soulayphet Schwader opened Khe-Yo because he didnât know of any restaurants in New York that served the food his mother made at home. Like a lot of Laotians who came to America following the Communist takeover, in 1975, Schwader grew up in the Midwest, and when he wanted his Laotian fix he had to head back to Wichita. Khe-Yo is a joint project with the chef and restaurateur Marc Forgione, who brings an aggressively seasonal approach, and the result is similar to Thai food in its careful balance of sweet and spicy, but with the sour, funky element turned up a notch."],["p","Laos is landlocked, so itâs not surprising that meat, rather than fish, is emphasized at Khe-Yo. Among the best dishes are a whole grilled quail on a stick, tasting like charcoal and ginger, and a steak tartare thatâs served, Flintstones style, atop a giant bone filled with roasted marrow. These heavy proteins are lightened up with the ubiquitous bang-bang, a Thai chili sauce that is particularly incendiary."],["p","Youâll also eat a lot of sticky rice. It arrives at the beginning of the meal, is meant to be eaten throughout, and is hidden in many dishes in another form, toasted and ground up. The resulting powder is similar in appearance and umami finish to old-school supermarket Parmesan. Sprinkled liberally, it practically declares an intention to mess with your tongue, as in the spectacular roasted-kabocha-squash salad, made with little beech mushrooms and mint. While a more traditional Laotian preparation would use chicken, pork, or duck in place of squash, the sticky-rice powder, along with red onion, Kaffir leaf, and chili, renders a familiar vegetable alien, in the most pleasantly disorienting way. Itâs not as in-your-face as an entire animal head, but itâs another salad that deserves to catch on.Â â¦"],["p",["em","Open daily for dinner.

Gare du Nord, the great cast-iron train station at the northern end of Paris, has always been a tense placeâ",["em","tendu"],", as the French say. They regard it as both stressful by nature and drawn taut by difference. Every European train station has some of that character: on a continent where rail still carries people in large numbers, many kinds of people come together where the railroad ends. Outside the Gare du Nord, there are people streaming from the Eurostar, tourists looking for a weekâs pleasure, mingled with travellers recently arrived from Bulgaria and Romania, looking for a job or a new life. The kinds cross, with the French, permanently frowning and suspicious, among them, and the tension rises."],["p","On a damp, cold, smoky November morning, a group of four teen-age French-African boys wearing badges announcing them as fund-raisers for ",["em",{"class":"small"},"UNICEF"]," accost people outside the stationâs glass doors. They ask for money, courteously but insistently. Suddenly, a man cries, âYouâre assailing people in broad daylight,â and swings his fists impotently at the air. The teen-agers back away, either puzzled by his hostility or merely discouraged by his lack of pliability. Four French cops watch carefully from no more than ten feet awayâsmiling slightly to one another while remaining fixed in place, demonstrating the usual conviction of the French police that the human comedy as it unfolds is so absorbing that to intervene and impose artificial order upon it would be inartistic."],["p","The police presence, however delicate, is the consequence of something new: an epidemic of petty crime in Paris that has traumatized the city in ways that seem disproportionate to the real damage it has doneâand therefore, many think, must reflect a crisis rooted elsewhere. It is a rare Parisian who does not have a tale of being pickpocketed at an A.T.M. or a MÃ©tro entrance. Many will tell you, with a grimace, about the petition scam: a group of kidsâat the Gare du Nord, outside the MusÃ©e dâOrsay, in the MÃ©troâcrowd around asking you to sign a petition, often, with a satiric point not lost on the victims afterward, for the protection of minority rights. While you are signing, wrist clasped in grateful solidarity by the petition-holder, two or three of her fellows go nimbly through your pockets, thus combining your indignation about the plight of the underprivileged with the desire of the underprivileged to remedy their plight by taking your cell phone. Last April, the Louvre shut down for a day as employees protested against the bands of feral kids coming inside to clean out the pockets of visitors and staff."],["p","The thieves, and their invisible directors, are perceived by the French public as exclusively âRomaââwhat English speakers often call Gypsies, the nomadic people long idealized as romantic and, for just as long, pursued as petty criminals. In the past decade, a new wave has arrived from Eastern Europe, brought by the laws of the European Union, slowly adopted over the past ten years, which guarantee âfree movement of personsâ among all its member states."],["p","Today, as the drama of the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"UNICEF"]," boys plays out, one of these Ã©migrÃ©s, an Albanian-born Rom named Saimir Mile, is drinking coffee at a brasserie across the street. Mile, the head of an activist group called La Voix des Rroms, is sitting outside in the damp air, with a woman friend who is also an activist from the group, both suffering from the cough, the ",["em","toux"],", that is the percussion accompaniment of a Paris winter. He is trying to explain the peculiar history and plight of his people to a reporter."],["p","âThe Roma are a peopleâthat is essential,â he says. âWe are a dispersed people, and yet we still have a language, Romani, of Indian origin, which remains the language of communication among the fifteen million or so Roma around the world. Because we are a dispersed people, without a state, there is some particularity to our feeling of belonging. For instance, the word ",["em","tsigane"],"ââthe traditional French word for Roma, and used by most French peopleââis not a word in Romani, but ",["em","tsigane"]," doesnât correspond to anything precise. It corresponds to an image made of stereotypes.â"],["p","A waitress, coming out of the cafÃ©, sees the reporterâs cell phone on the table. âPay attention to your phone,â she says anxiously, âbecause there are . . .â She notices the company. âThere are people who pass,â she says, and goes back inside."],["p","Mileâs companion frowns and declares, âShe was going to say, âThere are ",["em","gitans."],"â â ",["em","Gitan"]," is a variant of ",["em","tsigane"],", one more of the bewildering number of words in French for the people who pass."],["p","A woman in a long skirt and a head scarf, melodramatically clutching a bundle that seems to contain, or represent, a baby, approaches. â_Ma-_dame,â she pleads to Mileâs companion, in the two-note whine familiar to generations of Paris cafÃ© sittersâa supplicant asking for money from the seated, who will stiffen, or bend, at the sound.

words are typical of what StÃ©phane LÃ©vÃªque, the editor of the ",["em","Journal of Tsigane Studies,"]," describes as the recurring âdiscourseâ of the Roma in France: they are a people, helpless and disorganized, and therefore distasteful; they are a nation, exotic and sinister, and therefore frightening. This twoness infects everything that is said about them. People who want to speak in defense of the Roma in France ask that you make distinctions and discriminations among themânot just between the few who steal and the great majority who donât but among the many ethnic divisions within the group. The same people then go on to insist that the one thing that Roma lack is a proper sense of unity, without which they will always be persecuted. Itâs an old predicament of identity politics. We are manifold and must be respected as individualsâand we are completely different from the rest of you, with our own culture and history, giving us a collective identity that allows us to belong to the larger world of nations, just as you do. Itâs our being completely different from the rest of you that makes us like the rest of you."],["p","It seems inevitable, then, that it would be two distinct but conjoined crises that brought the Roma and their persistent double nature into intense publicity over the past year. One was the prosecution of a Roma âmafiaâ network: a Bosnian Rom named Fehim Hamidovic was put on trial last spring as the leader of one of the largest pickpocketing rings ever discovered in the French capital, along with subsidiary rings in Madrid and Brussels. âA modern-day Faginâ was the irresistible description of him in the British press, though not one much present in France, where theyâve got Victor Hugo in place of Dickens. Arrested in Rome, where he has a villa, Hamidovic turned out to own a second home, as well as a Porsche Cayenne. The French police estimated that he and his wife earned 1.3 million euros from their Paris-based pickpocketing ring in 2009 alone. Hamidovic, who was sentenced to seven years in prison, ran a brutalizing business, in which child thieves were threatened by beatings, cigarette burnings, and rape. He kept his distance from the streets, and enforced his rule through his sons. The children they organized were instructed to pay particular attention to Asian tourists, who are believed to walk around with large sums of money, have trouble communicating in French, and are inclined to ride the MÃ©tro. As the trial progressed, ever more lurid stories filled the media, culminating in tales of Roma abductors waiting to take European babies on demand. [cartoon id=\"a17738\"]"],["p","The second case was that of Leonarda Dibrani, a Roma girl who was removed from a French school bus in October by the police and, with her family, expelled from the country. (Though the father claimed they were from Italy, they seem actually to have come from Kosovo, not a member of the E.U.) If Hamidovic was the face of the predatory Roma, Leonarda was the face of their persecution. She inspired a cause, âlittle Leonarda,â and for a while her welfare became a popular piety. In August, however, a respectable weekly called ",["em","Valeurs Actuelles"]," (",["em","Current Values"],") had already taken a startlingly tabloid turn, putting out an issue whose cover displayed an image of a caravan with a red diagonal drawn through it and the line âThe Roma Overdose.â An angry editorial outlined all âthe things weâre not allowed to sayââthat the Roma are a public burden and a social nuisanceâwith a poll showing that the vast majority of the French people thought that the Roma camps should be forcibly disbanded. The governing Socialist Party, which controls both the Presidency and parliament, quickly condemned the magazine and its editor, Yves de Kerdrel, for being âshameful, anti-republican and inciting xenophobic violence against a minority group of the population.â"],["p","The Socialist Party and its adherents were therefore shocked when, a month later, the Interior Minister, Manuel Vallsâthe countryâs top cop, and himself the son of refugees from Spainâannounced that he was not only determined to enforce the law that had thrown out little Leonarda but would be as outspoken as ",["em","Valeurs Actuelles"]," had been about the issue. âThere is no solution other than dismantling the Roma camps progressively and sending the Roma back to the border,â he said. âThe Roma should return to Romania or Bulgaria, and the European Union, with the Romanian and Bulgarian authorities, must make an effort to integrate these populations in their countries.â He added, soon after, âThe majority should return to their countries.Â .Â .Â .Â Our role is not to welcome all the worldâs misery.â"],["p","Vallsâs wordsâwidely taken both as a testament of no-nonsense enforcement and as a bid for eventual power as Prime Minister or even Presidentâbrought about an open split in the Socialist cabinet, minister against minister. FranÃ§ois Hollande, the less than resolute President, finally went live on television to make a Solomonic offer, giving the fifteen-year-old girl the chance to return to France and finish her studies if she came aloneâonly to be ambushed by the television networks, which cut instantly to Leonarda in Kosovo, refusing the Presidentâs offer. (âNot without my family,â she said.)"],["p","Though many on the left were sympathetic to the distrait Hollande, Valls supporters included many more of those who made the philosopher Alain Finkielkrautâs book âThe Misfortunes of Identityâ a best-seller of the fall season. Finkielkrautâs book, though not at all Roma-centric, is an exasperated account of how the old Republican idea of French identity, open to all through education but still very specific in its style (high-minded) and values (meritocratic to the max), has been demoralized by a slack and hasty pluralism. Valls supporters thought that the sentimental cult of Leonarda was a form of âangelismââmeaning a refusal to face unpleasant realities, in this case the truth about the self-evident (if historically rooted) pathologies of an underclass. They insist, with Finkielkraut, that this âangelismâ is part of a larger, enforced cult of the âOther,â a compulsory act of celebrating difference that is undermining the French state, so that

of the many oddities of the pickpocketing crisis is that it coincides with the establishment of serious âRomani studiesâ in France and elsewhere. Scholars have sought to make sense of the semi-metaphysical quality of Romanipen as a fully historical condition, the way that an earlier generation of historians tried to make something of the equivalent idea of Yiddishkeitâthe shared essence of Jewish culture. One can go down halls and turn corridors in the labyrinth of offices in Sciences Po, the great French institute of political science, and bump into scholars whose special subject is the Roma of Bulgaria, or the Manouches of the Massif Central, or the Sinti of Italy, busy pursuing truths of their actual history and of the romance they trail."],["p","The larger story is plain enough. The Roma do seem to have emigrated, as they have always claimed, in a distinct wave, perhaps a thousand years ago, from northern India. Nomadic throughout Eastern Europe, in France in the nineteenth century they became an increasingly settled people. The Roma have not just contributed to French culture out of proportion to their numbersâthe great Manouche guitarist Django Reinhardt, for instance, created one of the few styles of jazz entirely outside Americaâbut have even become a sort of exotic ornament of the French state, with a special administrative category all to themselves. The French Republic is, in principle, blind to ethnic origin, and so the Roma are classed as ",["em","gens du voyage"],", travelling people, and are uniquely allowed to carry identity cards with no fixed residence. (In a country where an identity card is an identity, this is a big deal.)"],["p","Yet most of the post-2000 Roma immigrants had not been nomadic for generationsânot until the moment they decided to move to France. âAmong the Bulgarian and the Romanian Roma were low-caste people with fixed roles in agriculture,â NadÃ¨ge Ragaru, a scholar at Sciences Po who focusses on the Balkans, explains, with the fast-speaking efficiency available only to a French academic. âSome were agricultural workers on collective farms in the East for several generations, until the privatization of the farms after the end of Communism pushed them outward, and, ironically, they reclaimed their identity as nomads, though they were really immigrants in search of work. Essentially, it is a phenomenon of post-Communism in the East, rather than of their âeternalâ identity in Europe. In Germany, the first waves were bought off and sent home. In France, they stayed. The Roma do not present another faith, another religionâtheir threat is more a question of their appearance, which helps explain why they are so disturbing, despite their small numbers. In a matter of years, representations of the ",["em","tsiganes"]," have shifted away from musical talents, ",["em","bohÃ¨me"],", and free spirit to a portrayal of Roma otherness. It is our decision to ",["em","see"]," kinds that makes us ",["em","sort"]," kinds.â"],["p","For Sarah Carmona, a leading historian of the Roma in Europe, and herself a Rom, the central issue in the Roma crisis is French paranoia. Long-haired and eloquent, she is not merely quadrilingual but bi-academic: she speaks the abstract language of French history, of Foucault and Serres, with the same authority with which she speaks in the blunt imagery of the Romani language. âYes, the European vision of us can only be called paranoid and schizophrenic,â she says. âThey love our Gypsyness, our folklore, but hate our Romaniness. They claim to value our distinctiveness, and, at the same time, they cannot bear our abnormality.â"],["p","She offers an instance of Romanipen. âRomani is a very metaphoric, richly illustrated languageâa language uniquely concrete in its visual sensitivity. So in Romani when you tell someone that you love him you might say, âI eat your heartâ or âI eat your belly.â Itâs an expression of affection. My daughter, when she was ten, said to her friend, âIâd like to eat your belly!â I was called into the schoolâthe principal was shocked! Perhaps my daughter needed to see a psychiatrist.â"],["p","On one subject, Carmona is categorical. âFrance is the worst place for Roma to be born. It suffers from centuries of âEnlightenment,â the many centuries that created this Jacobin so-called âuniversalistâ frame without any regard to subjugated knowledge or subjugated peoples. In France, ethnic minorities are not even recognizedâthereâs a process of negation of identity that leads to the absurd category of â",["em","gens du voyage"],".â To Valls, I would say that nobody should try to integrate himself into a society that is entirely sick. The Roma are offensive for one reason: because we stand outside history. I mean History constructed with a big âHââthe history that fuses and strips away micro-identity. We belong to micro-history. We are global, and we are also micro, and we are the only ones who can manage this concept in a healthy way. We can be Roma in the political sphere, be considered Sinti in another, family sphere. We can even become Gypsies, ",["em","tsiganes"],", in order to deal with non-Roma people.

the subject of petty crime, the scholars of Romanipen all say more or less the same thing: recognizing that a social pathology persists within a minority group is not the same thing as imagining that the social pathology is natural to the minority group. Pressed to make a living in the only way left to them after a long history of oppression, the Roma, like the âusuriousâ Jews, are invariably reproached for it by those who left them no alternative."],["p","Yet such rationales exasperate the practical-minded politicians and pundits who must deal with immigrants without papers and bundles without babies in them. For them, the spectre haunting France has nothing to do with the virtues of âmicro-identities.â The spectre is, simply, the extreme rightâMarine Le Pen and her National Frontâwho will be the beneficiaries of a French state that cannot control its borders and police its streets. The National Front is already expected to be the largest single party in France during the May elections for the European Parliament. If an unashamed, âde-complexedâ agenda of national order and national security is not made plausible, the argument goes, the middle classes will continue their flight to the far right."],["p","Yves de Kerdrel, the editor of ",["em","Valeurs Actuelles"],", turns out to be a man of this desperate middle. Discovered in his office over coffee in the early morning, Kerdrel, a former Sarkozy intimate, comes across as an elegant, fluent ",["em","haut fonctionnaire"]," type, with a somewhat Americanophile reverence for focus groups and polls. Le Pen can be declawed, he thinks, only if mainstream politicians can learn to speak truths that seem obvious to the stressed middle class."],["p","âThe problem is that we cannot make the case strictly in terms of economics,â he says. âWhen I decided to relaunch ",["em","Valeurs Actuelles,"]," we did focus groups, and all the people we spoke with said, âWe donât want a political magazine, we want a magazine that speaks about social issues. Family, environment, drugs, school.â The big problem in France is one of authority. Where is the authority in France? There is no authority in France now. FranÃ§ois Hollande is no authority. In the family, where is the authority? In school, where is the authority? The âregalâ state of France has become nonexistent. All the âroyalistâ functionsâDefense, Justice, the Interiorâare the functions of authority. And they are without it. Seventy-three per cent of the French oppose having Roma living near their homes. Itâs not a problem of left or rightâitâs a global problem. Valls had public opinion with him, including the left, and he knew it.â [cartoon id=\"a17940\"]"],["p","Drinking his coffee indignantly, Kerdrel tells how the mayor of the small town of Villeneuve-Saint-Georges tried to apply the rules. (Though social policies are made in Paris, it is left to mayors to enforce them.) âThe rule is that you must give to the Roma the means to integrateâyou must integrate the Roma. Fine, itâs a problem of minuscule numbersâtwenty thousand Roma. You must send the children to school, and if the illegal encampments are dangerous the mayor must find, all by himself, a legal spaceârequisition a hotel and lodge them in the hotel, with the cityâs tax dollars. So he did it. They were installed in a hotel. Twenty-four hours later, he said he got a call from the director of the hotel: they had stripped the rooms of all the furnishings and the hinges and knobs, and fled! ",["em","This"]," is the problem of integration. What you can say twenty years ago, you canât say it now. It is this question of ",["em","bien-pensants,"]," of angelism, and the right wing and the left wing are together responsible.â"],["p","He turns to the subject of Leonarda. âIf you are without papers in France and the police do not arrest you for five years, at the end of five years you become legal. The family had been here for four years and ten monthsâthere were only two months to go. So they simply applied the decision of the justice system. And it was time, because two months later it would have been impossible. What shocked the French is that the father of the girl said, publicly, We had looked at Romania and Kosovo, et cetera, and we looked to find where the social system was the strongest. He was a rational actor, as we say in economics. He made a search to find where the system would pay him the most. In France, he would earn three hundred and eighty euros minimum, plus free schoolingâand even if you had no papers someone had to find you a lodging. You have organizations, subsidized by the Ministry of the Interior, to do all this! He came here because he could get the best deal here. He was a rational economic actor!â He shakes his head, half stunned to find one in France."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOne%20of%20the%20touching%20things%20about%20the%20Roma%20obsession%20is%20that%20it%20has%20drawn%20at%20least%20some%20of%20the%20figures%20of%20the%20old%2C%20settled%20Manouche%20and%20Gitan%20communities%20into%20solidarity%20with%20the%20pitiful%20newcomers.%20Alexandre%20Roman%C3%A8s%2C%20a%20poet%20and%20the%20owner%20and%20ringmaster%20of%20the%20magnificent%20Cirque%20Tzigane%2C%20surprised%20many%20people%20by%20writing%20a%20series%20of%20pieces%20in%20the%20newspapers%2C%20expressing%20his%20sense%20of%20common%20purpose%20with%20the%20recent%20arrivals.%20His%20circus%2C%20the%20most%20soulful%20and%20sporadically%20incompetent%20in%20the%20world%2C%20takes%20up%20residence%20every%20winter%20in%20a%20small%20tent%20set%20up%20somewhere%20on%20the%20outskirts%20of%20Paris.%20On%20a%20cold%20November%20night%2C%20members%20of%20his%20family%20dance%20and%20do%20very%20light%20tightrope%20walking%2C%20juggling%2C%20and%20trapeze.%20Clubs%20fall%20from%20hands%3B%20cousins%20gasp%20at%20undue%20risks%3B%20and%20Roman%C3%A8s%20keeps%20a%20wary%20eye%20on%20all.%20The%20skill%20level%20is%20no%20threat%20to%20the%20Cirque%20du%20Soleil%2C%20but%20the%20continual%20stream%20and%20thrum%20of%20Manouche%20music%2C%20and%20the%20sense%20of%20family%20entanglement%2C%20more%20than%20make%20up%20for%20it.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAfterward%2C%20Roman%C3%A8s%20sits%2C%20with%20an%20air%20of%20melancholy%2C%20and%20talks%20about%20the%20plight%20of%20the%20Roma.%20He%20has%20had%2C%20as%20he%20knows%2C%20an%20exceptional%20life.%20All%20the%20bittersweet%20emotion%20that%20fills%20Django%20Reinhardt%E2%80%99s%20music%20is%20apparent%20here%E2%80%94and%2C%20of%20course%2C%20it%20is%20as%20ersatz%2C%20or%20as%20multiple%2C%20as%20any%20other%20folk%20emotion.%20As%20a%20young%20man%2C%20Roman%C3%A8s%20explains%2C%20he%20left%20his%20family%E2%80%99s%20commercial%20circus%20to%20become%20a%20Baroque%20lute%20player.%20(%E2%80%9CBach%2C%20Monteverdi%2C%20Lully%2C%20Charpentier%3A%20those%20are%20my%20passions.%E2%80%9D)%20While%20pursuing%20his%20career%2C%20he%20befriended%20the%20poet%20Jean%20Genet%2C%20who%20had%20an%20avant-garde%20interest%20in%20%E2%80%9Cmarginal%E2%80%9D%20performance%2C%20and%20it%20was%20in%20part%20his%20friendship%20with%20Genet%2C%20rather%20than%20some%20Romani%20legacy%2C%20that%20led%20him%20back%20to%20the%20circus.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CIn%20Eastern%20Europe%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20worse%20than%20under%20the%20so-called%20Communist%20regimes%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20says.%20%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20no%20longer%20even%20allowed%20to%20claim%20the%20right%20to%20wander%20that%20we%20have%20always%20had.%20That%20is%20the%20essence%20of%20our%20history.%20Why%20should%20we%20integrate%3F%20We%E2%80%99ve%20been%20here%20for%20centuries%20without%20integrating.%E2%80%9D%20The%20fate%20of%20Jews%20and%20Roma%20is%20linked.%20Something%20like%20a%20quarter%20of%20the%20European%20population%20of%20Roma%20were%20murdered%20in%20the%20camps%20and%20killing%20grounds%20of%20the%20Holocaust.%20Nonetheless%2C%20one%20repeated%20Roma%20grievance%20is%20that%20they%20remain%20second-class%20Shoah%20citizens%2C%20relegated%20to%20the%20margins%20of%20martyrdom%2C%20their%20suffering%20winning%20at%20best%20a%20footnote%20and%20a%20side%20chapel%20at%20the%20sites%20of%20commemoration.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CAbout%20Leonarda%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20went%20on%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20would%20simply%20quote%20what%20I%20think%20Gandhi%20said%3A%20%E2%80%98When%20the%20law%20is%20not%20respectable%2C%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20respect%20the%20law.%E2%80%99%20We%20are%20all%20one%20people%2C%20the%20%3Cem%3Etsiganes%3C%2Fem%3E%20east%20and%20west%20and%20south.%20But%20we%20can%20no%20longer%20roam.%20Ask%20yourself%3A%20Which%20would%20you%20rather%20have%3F%20A%20ceiling%20above%20your%20head%3F%20Or%20the%20starry%20sky%20at%20night%3F%E2%80%9D%20It%20is%20perhaps%20noteworthy%20that%2C%20in%20defending%20the%20newcomers%20from%20the%20East%2C%20the%20ringmaster%20of%20the%20__Cirque%20Tzigane%20refuses%20to%20call%20them%20Roma%20and%20refers%20to%20them%2C%20as%20to%20himself%2C%20only%20as%20%3Cem%3Etsiganes.%3C%2Fem%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","One of the touching things about the Roma obsession is that it has drawn at least some of the figures of the old, settled Manouche and Gitan communities into solidarity with the pitiful newcomers. Alexandre RomanÃ¨s, a poet and the owner and ringmaster of the magnificent Cirque Tzigane, surprised many people by writing a series of pieces in the newspapers, expressing his sense of common purpose with the recent arrivals. His circus, the most soulful and sporadically incompetent in the world, takes up residence every winter in a small tent set up somewhere on the outskirts of Paris. On a cold November night, members of his family dance and do very light tightrope walking, juggling, and trapeze. Clubs fall from hands; cousins gasp at undue risks; and RomanÃ¨s keeps a wary eye on all.

Those who donât respect the laws have no place in this country, even if itâs painful to take them back to the border. Republican values are indispensable to democracy, essential to progress. If there are no rules, it is always the weakest that suffer. As a man of the left, I find this essential. For me, respect for law is completely linked with our ideas of humanity and generosity.

Over the next forty-seven years, her influence fluctuated, as first her son and then an adopted son assumed power, but her political sense always remained acute.

Digging canals and making ships for the herring industry required a high degree of collaboration among disparate groups, who found a novel justification for their labors: that they would benefit not only the community but individuals as well.

This compelling novel about a serial killer who preys on lonely women is based on an actual case, from 1931. But the protagonist, Emily Thornhill, a journalist who becomes invested in avenging the victims, is a richly imagined character. She moves audaciously in the male world of police officers and lawyers as she investigates the fate of a middle-aged widow who was seduced by the letter of a man who then killed her and her children. Thornhill is inspired and guided by the spirit of the youngest child, and, as horror reveals itself, so does goodness. Lovers meet; a street child finds a home. Phillipsâs achievement is to reveal how intimately cruelty and kindness

2013 wound to a close and dismal year-end assessments poured in on the performance of the Obama Administrationâthe N.S.A. surveillance scandal, the botched Obamacare rolloutâthe President was looking for idea men. His move was to fly in a cadre of brainy Silicon Valley types. But he might have also dropped by Harlem, where a fund-raiser for the Burning Man Project, the nonprofit spinoff of the annual arts festival and bacchanal in the Nevada desert, had taken on a chin-stroking air. âYou know what Iâm really interested in?â Larry Harvey, the festivalâs founder, said, in his remarks onstage. âGovernance.â"],["p","Burning Man is no Model U.N., but as a congregation of self-appointed outliers in silly hats it was a forerunner of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street. The festival began in 1986, when Harvey and friends burned a generic human-shaped effigy on a beach in San Francisco, but in recent years it has acquired an establishment vibe, in part because of its role as a laboratory for social organization. This year, it attracted sixty-eight thousand people, who lived for a week in a tent-trailer-and-motor-home civilization, which has its own gift-based economy (there is no money allowed, except for buying coffee and ice), airport, law enforcement, emergency services, and electrical grid."],["p","Harvey spoke about the festivalâs global ambitions. Burning Man is guided by what initiates call the Ten Principles: Radical Inclusion, Gifting, Decommodification, Radical Self-Reliance, Radical Self-Expression, Communal Effort, Civic Responsibility, Leaving No Trace, Participation, and Immediacy. These ideas, Harvey suggested, might one day form the basis of a new world order: Burners have helped revitalize downtown Las Vegas and met with members of the Australian government. âWeâre planning for a hundred years,â Harvey told the crowd. âIf we can govern the way we want, then what ",["em","weâve"]," all experiencedââat Burning Manââwill be a very common experience.â He concluded that âwhen the world comes to a crisisâand we know itâs comingââthatâs when the Burner knowledge will come in handy."],["p","But what wisdom could our government take from Burning Man right now? The fund-raiser was held at a swanky converted church owned by a man named Michel Madie. âIâm a healer,â said Madie, who had a white goatee and wore a top hat with a peacock feather. âMy work is soul boxing.â He is also a successful real-estate broker, whose firm handles hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales. Madie said that he would not advise the federal government to adopt a gift economy. âThe idea that Burning Man is anti-capitalist is totally incorrect,â he said. âYou have to have a pretty hefty amount of money to go there and enjoy it. I think capitalism is promotion of self, and so is Burning Man.â"],["p","Marceau GuÃ©rin, a Ph.D. student researching tree physiology at Columbia, said, âTo Obama, I would say, âCome have a look.â Itâs about the crazy hidden part of people.â Matt Goldberg, the former C.E.O. of Lonely Planet, said, âItâs about change. I first went out in 2003ââhe was working in corporate development at the ",["em","Wall Street Journal"],". âI came back with renewed energy about how to innovate.â A man named Earth offered Obama revelations heâd picked up on the playa: âTalk to more strangers. Truly think that anything is possible.â He explained that Earth is his given nameâEarth Bennettâand that by day heâs a pharmaceutical-ad salesman. When it came to Obamacare, the writer Julia Allison offered a bit of advice: âIf people took self-relianceââone of the Ten Principlesââas a central tenet of health, weâd have people taking really good care of themselves. Since Iâve been to Burning Man, I havenât gotten sick.â"],["p","Nina Urban, a psychiatrist at Columbia, does brain experiments on what she called âparty drugs.â She said, âI divide the Burning Man population into five subgroups: hippies, raver kids, true artists who want to build something they could not build otherwise, and the technologists who roll in for a few days from the Bay Area. The last group is the one I belong to: the costumers, who want to express themselves by dressing up.â Her boyfriend, Jim Glaser, who goes by the name Costume Jim, is the head of Kostume Kult, a group that is a leading participant in SantaConâthe annual parade of drunk people in Santa outfits. Costume Jim shook his head and said, âIt grew beyond what we could control.â"],["p","This served as a reminder: Burning Man doesnât have all the answers when it comes to social organization. The festival is plagued by the same problems that plague American society. In recent years, regulars have complained about the influx of rich celebritiesâSean (Diddy) Combsâand tech-world fat cats: the Winklevoss twins attended, and Mark Zuckerberg choppered in for a day."],["p","An artist named Eric (Knuckles) Forman said that he was over Burning Man. âIâm someone who goes and loves it and then hates it,â he said. âAnd every time I think Iâm done with it, it pulls me back.âÂ â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/principled","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7641c92e2c9b85da11","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Barack

drove a cab, and one of his fares, surprised to see such a young guy at the wheel, remarked that taxi-driving was an âold manâs hustle.â The same might be said about owning a shop on the Lower East Side, where a legacy of independent art has segued into big profits, but Old Man Hustle celebrates raucous amateurism. The wine list is small but affordable, and hot dogs, topped with ethnic-inspired combinations like chopped onions and teriyaki sauce, are offered sporadically. Thereâs a stage in the rear, no bigger than a dunk tank, and the microphone is always on, goading visitors to perform. One recent evening, a savant with an electric guitar and perfect pitch fielded requests at a sing-along, while a tambourine circulated, followed by complimentary grappa. A young woman in a short skirt and an oversized sweater sang an inspired rendition of âBlue Velvet.â Then a Coney Island sideshow performer drove a nail into his nostril with a claw hammer. A first-timer found the scene reminiscent of Club Silencio, in David Lynchâs âMulholland Drive.â His friend, a psychoanalyst, diagnosed the room: âItâs the most random group of people Iâve ever seen.âÂ â¦"]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/old-man-hustle","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ca636cecf4019214221","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bars","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"bars"},{"id":"5c2e1cce41c92e2c9b85da96","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hot Dogs","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hot-dogs"},{"id":"5c2e1d67ee7fe02cbd16341a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lower East Side","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lower-east-side"},{"id":"5c2e1cd62396212cbb9fca0c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Taxis","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"taxis"},{"id":"5c2e1eff22d4972cd5b834c5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wine Bars","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wine-bars"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5907ef71ebe912338a37173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907ef71ebe912338a37173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bar Tab","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bar-tab"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Bar Tab","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"bar-tab"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Bars","url":"/tag/bars"},{"name":"Hot Dogs","url":"/tag/hot-dogs"},{"name":"Lower East Side","url":"/tag/lower-east-side"},{"name":"Taxis","url":"/tag/taxis"},{"name":"Wine Bars","url":"/tag/wine-bars"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Rob Fischer","type":"author","title":"","email":"","bio":null,"social":[],"url":"/contributors/rob-fischer","image":null}],"dek":"39 Essex St. (212-253-7747)","formatting":{},"hed":"Old Man Hustle","id":"5911474f6c4c222f03a88291","inlineEmbeds":{},"issueDate":"January 13, 2014","modifiedAt":"2017-06-19T07:43:21.753Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"59094dcb019dfc3494e9d015","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2560,"height":1440,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2017/05/03/59094dcb019dfc3494e9d014_140113_r24493.jpg"}},"caption":null,"altText":"Illustration by Matthew Hollister","credit":"Illustration by Matthew Hollister","filename":"140113_r24493.jpg","revision":4,"title":"140113_r24493","notes":"_wordpress_id:1576811","variants":{}}]},"promoDek":"","promoHed":"","related":{"relatedList":[],"featuredVideo":[]},"rubric":{"name":"Bar Tab","url":"/magazine/bar-tab"},"seoTitle":"Old Man Hustle","seoDescription":"Old Man Hustle, a tiny brick-walled wine bar and performance space on the Lower East Side, celebrates raucous amateurism.

data-page="page_1"></span>the Cooper Union building was erected on Astor Place, in the late eighteen-fifties, its construction boasted several technological innovations. Being built from iron beams and cement, it was resistant to fire; it also incorporated that highly novel feature, an elevator. Peter Cooper, the industrialist and philanthropist who founded the school, had hoped for another ambitious design feature: a rooftop garden for the refreshment and recreation of the working-class, tenement-dwelling students who were to be provided with a free education under the terms of the institutionâs charter.</p><p>Cooper was persuaded to forgo his paradisiacal plans for his buildingâs roof; but his hopes of establishing an institution without tuition fees endured for more than a hundred and fifty years. Then, three years ago, in the wake of the financial downturn, the collegeâs board of trustees began investigating the possibility of charging students for at least part of their education. By 2013, the decision had been made to institute fees of about twenty thousand dollars per year, characterizing that sum as half of the value of the free tuition previously granted to all. Mark Epstein, who was then the board chairman, announced, âUnder the new policy, the Cooper Union will continue to adhere to the vision of Peter Cooper, who founded the institution specifically to provide a quality education to those who might not otherwise be able to afford it.â Many critics argued that the proposal was directly counter to the vision of Peter Cooper. But, despite extensive protests of the Occupy sort and legal efforts by students and alumni, the policy went into effect last fall, when the first fee-paying undergraduates enrolled at the college.</p><p><a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-attorney-general-eric-schneiderman-is-investigating-cooper-union-1427244617" target="_blank">As first reported</a>, in March, in the <em class="">Wall Street Journal</em>, the office of Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, was investigating the institution, examining the management of its endowment for possible conflicts of interest. The endowment derives almost entirely from revenue generated by the land under the Chrysler Building, which was deeded to Cooper Union in the early twentieth century; a small percentage is invested in hedge funds. Reportedly, the institutionâs dealings with Tishman Speyer, the powerful real-estate company that manages the Chrysler Building, is being probed, as are the terms of a hundred-and-seventy-five-million-dollar loan taken out for the construction of a spectacular new building opposite Peter Cooperâs. The building, designed by Thom Mayne and clad in perforated metal, has become a symbol of sorts. It refreshingly subverts Modernist notions of transparency, according to Nicolai Ouroussoff, the architecture critic at the <em class="">Times</em>, who noted approvingly that its architect is âmore interested in the dark, hidden corners where people can loiter, get into mischief, escape from authority.â</p><p>Details of the clash between board members and Jamshed Bharucha, the Cooper Union president, have been <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/cooper-union-president-and-board-chairman-clashed-at-harvard-club-1429491722" target="_blank">luridly unspooling in the press</a>, including the revelation that the board hired a psychoanalyst turned business consultant, Dr. Kerry Sulkowicz, in an effort to remedy the curdled interpersonal dynamics. (Dr. Sulkowicz is the father of Emma Sulkowicz, the Columbia University senior who has been <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/two-beds-and-the-burdens-of-feminism">carrying a mattress on campus</a> for several months in protest against that institutionâs handling of allegations of sexual violence.) It emerged last month that the board had offered not to renew Bharuchaâs contract when it comes up for review next year, as part of a proposed deal with the Attorney Generalâs office. Meanwhile, critics inside and outside the institution have continued to accuse it of a lack of transparency even more obfuscating than Mayneâs stainless-steel faÃ§ade.</p><p>At an introductory day held earlier this month for students who will be matriculating in the fall, members of Free Cooper Union, a group of activist students, handed out copies of a â2015 Disorientation Reader,â which offered background information on the dispute. âNow is the time to imagine new futures for Cooper Union,â it read, offering some possible alternatives: âA school with no president. A president whose job is to eliminate the idea of a president. A community empowered to govern itself.â How much traction such rhetoric will sustain among a student body in which half of the members, as of next fall, will be paying a substantial sum for the privilege of being there, remains to be seen. As Litia Perta, a onetime adjunct professor at Cooper Union, has <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.brooklynrail.org/2011/12/local/why-cooper-union-matters" target="_blank">eloquently argued</a>, the promise of a free education provides its beneficiaries with more than just the technical knowledge acquired in the classroom. It also grants a student the freedom to go in whatever direction her or his intellectual inclinations lead, without regard to the ultimate economic utility of the course of study. That learning should not necessarily be linked to future earning power is an ideal increasingly under siege in institutions of higher learning. Simply by embodying and demonstrating an alternative paradigm, Cooper Union benefitted even those who were not members of its student body.</p><p>It seems perversely, even tragically, appropriate that an institution founded in New Yorkâs original Gilded Age may be foundering amid the financial pressures and preoccupations that characterize our freshly gilded Manhattan of today. When Cooper Union first opened, Peter Cooperâs stated aspirations were challenged in some quarters; some suspected him of being less the selfless idealist and more the canny pragmatist. A <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.americanheritage.com/content/honest-man?page=show" target="_blank">story is told</a> of an occasion upon which Cooper overheard the conversation of two gentlemen as they were passing by his building. One, noting the stores that operated on the ground floor, suggested that<span data-page="page_final"></span> the apparently high-minded institution was nothing but a tax dodge, enabling Cooper to avoid the fees charged to commercial establishments. Cooper instantly invited the two men into the Union and showed them around, displaying its library, free and open to the public, and its classrooms, in which night classes in design were held for men and day classes in shorthand and telegraphy were held for women. One of the pair was so impressed by what heâd seen that he later became a donor. Perhaps the Attorney Generalâs investigation will shed an equally clarifying light upon the inner workings of the institution today. Somehow, though, it seems unlikely to result in quite such an edifying conclusion.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ"><div class="Avatar__avatar___1_uRc ArticleContributors__bioAvatar___11Nu0"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/contributors/rebecca-mead"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b6e8b51cf59fc423c55/1:1/w_130,c_limit/mead-rebecca.png, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b6e8b51cf59fc423c55/1:1/w_260,c_limit/mead-rebecca.png 2x"/><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b6e8b51cf59fc423c55/1:1/w_130,c_limit/mead-rebecca.png" title=""/></picture></div></a></div><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false"><li><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">Rebecca Mead joined The New Yorker as a staff writer in 1997.

Union building was erected on Astor Place, in the late eighteen-fifties, its construction boasted several technological innovations. Being built from iron beams and cement, it was resistant to fire; it also incorporated that highly novel feature, an elevator. Peter Cooper, the industrialist and philanthropist who founded the school, had hoped for another ambitious design feature: a rooftop garden for the refreshment and recreation of the working-class, tenement-dwelling students who were to be provided with a free education under the terms of the institutionâs charter."],["p","Cooper was persuaded to forgo his paradisiacal plans for his buildingâs roof; but his hopes of establishing an institution without tuition fees endured for more than a hundred and fifty years. Then, three years ago, in the wake of the financial downturn, the collegeâs board of trustees began investigating the possibility of charging students for at least part of their education. By 2013, the decision had been made to institute fees of about twenty thousand dollars per year, characterizing that sum as half of the value of the free tuition previously granted to all. Mark Epstein, who was then the board chairman, announced, âUnder the new policy, the Cooper Union will continue to adhere to the vision of Peter Cooper, who founded the institution specifically to provide a quality education to those who might not otherwise be able to afford it.â Many critics argued that the proposal was directly counter to the vision of Peter Cooper. But, despite extensive protests of the Occupy sort and legal efforts by students and alumni, the policy went into effect last fall, when the first fee-paying undergraduates enrolled at the college."],["p",["a",{"href":"http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-attorney-general-eric-schneiderman-is-investigating-cooper-union-1427244617"},"As first reported"],", in March, in the ",["em","Wall Street Journal"],", the office of Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, was investigating the institution, examining the management of its endowment for possible conflicts of interest. The endowment derives almost entirely from revenue generated by the land under the Chrysler Building, which was deeded to Cooper Union in the early twentieth century; a small percentage is invested in hedge funds. Reportedly, the institutionâs dealings with Tishman Speyer, the powerful real-estate company that manages the Chrysler Building, is being probed, as are the terms of a hundred-and-seventy-five-million-dollar loan taken out for the construction of a spectacular new building opposite Peter Cooperâs. The building, designed by Thom Mayne and clad in perforated metal, has become a symbol of sorts. It refreshingly subverts Modernist notions of transparency, according to Nicolai Ouroussoff, the architecture critic at the ",["em","Times"],", who noted approvingly that its architect is âmore interested in the dark, hidden corners where people can loiter, get into mischief, escape from authority.â"],["p","Details of the clash between board members and Jamshed Bharucha, the Cooper Union president, have been ",["a",{"href":"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cooper-union-president-and-board-chairman-clashed-at-harvard-club-1429491722"},"luridly unspooling in the press"],", including the revelation that the board hired a psychoanalyst turned business consultant, Dr. Kerry Sulkowicz, in an effort to remedy the curdled interpersonal dynamics. (Dr. Sulkowicz is the father of Emma Sulkowicz, the Columbia University senior who has been ",["a",{"href":"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/two-beds-and-the-burdens-of-feminism"},"carrying a mattress on campus"]," for several months in protest against that institutionâs handling of allegations of sexual violence.) It emerged last month that the board had offered not to renew Bharuchaâs contract when it comes up for review next year, as part of a proposed deal with the Attorney Generalâs office. Meanwhile, critics inside and outside the institution have continued to accuse it of a lack of transparency even more obfuscating than Mayneâs stainless-steel faÃ§ade."],["p","At an introductory day held earlier this month for students who will be matriculating in the fall, members of Free Cooper Union, a group of activist students, handed out copies of a â2015 Disorientation Reader,â which offered background information on the dispute. âNow is the time to imagine new futures for Cooper Union,â it read, offering some possible alternatives: âA school with no president. A president whose job is to eliminate the idea of a president. A community empowered to govern itself.â How much traction such rhetoric will sustain among a student body in which half of the members, as of next fall, will be paying a substantial sum for the privilege of being there, remains to be seen. As Litia Perta, a onetime adjunct professor at Cooper Union, has ",["a",{"href":"http://www.brooklynrail.org/2011/12/local/why-cooper-union-matters"},"eloquently argued"],", the promise of a free education provides its beneficiaries with more than just the technical knowledge acquired in the classroom. It also grants a student the freedom to go in whatever direction her or his intellectual inclinations lead, without regard to the ultimate economic utility of the course of study. That learning should not necessarily be linked to future earning power is an ideal increasingly under siege in institutions of higher learning. Simply by embodying and demonstrating an alternative paradigm, Cooper Union benefitted even those who were not members of its student body."],["p","It seems perversely, even tragically, appropriate that an institution founded in New Yorkâs original Gilded Age may be foundering amid the financial pressures and preoccupations that characterize our freshly gilded Manhattan of today.

Cooper instantly invited the two men into the Union and showed them around, displaying its library, free and open to the public, and its classrooms, in which night classes in design were held for men and day classes in shorthand and telegraphy were held for women. One of the pair was so impressed by what heâd seen that he later became a donor. Perhaps the Attorney Generalâs investigation will shed an equally clarifying light upon the inner workings of the institution today.

/photos/5c99431a97260b6f70cd2608]||||||\n\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe most important thing to know about Dominic Fike, a twenty-three-year-old musician from Florida, is that, someday soon, heâll be very famous. If you havenât yet heard of him, you will not be able to stop hearing about him (or hearing his music) in six months or a year. At least, thatâs the party line of the music industry, which has hung an extraordinary amount of hope on a young star with about fifteen minutes of officially streamable music. Fike is a precocious, photogenic artist with edgy face tattoos and sufficient talent. More important, he embodies the hazy, genre-less future of popular music.\n\nFor a potential music star, intrigue is the most valuable currency. Nobody has generated intrigue quite like Fike has, which makes his position as precarious as it is promising. At the time of his reported  four-million-dollar deal with Columbia, which he signed last year, Fike had no music available to stream on major platforms. His previously recorded music had been scrubbed from the Internet; there was an understanding among his handlers that scarcity would lead to buzz. (One YouTuber, BrandMan, recently posted a video about Fike titled âDominic Fikeâs Mysterious Rise,â and [coverage in the press](https://theinterns.net/2018/10/22/dominic-fikes-mysterious-rise-to-superstardom/) has used similar language.) By the time Fike released his dÃ©but EP, in Octoberâa collection of languorous demos called âDonât Forget About Meââthat buzz was palpable. Within days, his music was being praised on social media by suspiciously notable figures like DJ Khaled, Khalid, and Kourtney Kardashian. The attention seemed hazardously premature, as though Fikeâs superstardom was a foregone conclusion, and incidental to whatever music he ended up producing.\n\nFike grew up in South Florida, a region that has been unusually fertile for hip-hop talent over the past several years. Raised by a single mother who was in and out of jail, he had a mischievous streak, and says he spent much of his teen-age years partying with other latchkey kidsâskaters and aspiring musiciansâin the area. Though he listened to a distinctly Californian set of pop-punk and beachy alt-rock acts (Blink-182, Jack Johnson, the Red Hot Chili Peppers), he and his friends were mostly interested in rapping. They gathered at a friendâs guest house, which they dubbed âBackhouse,â where theyâd take turns freestyling; Fike self-released some of his rap songs here and there. Eventually, his tinkering crystallized into a style that felt both familiar and novel. His more recent songs bear little resemblance to any mainstream hip-hop, although they may signal its future. His EP, âDonât Forget About Me,â is nostalgic for the early-two-thousands beach-bonfire style of Johnson, with some of the watered-down reggae of 311 and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His major single, â3 Nights,â could generously be classified as high-quality retail music. It is, above all, easy to listen to. It shares plenty of DNA with a song like âRude,â a schlocky lawn-party reggae jam from the Canadian band MAGIC!, which riled and amused music critics for a passing moment, in 2013, before slipping into oblivion.\n\nAll of which doesnât sound like much cause for celebration, let alone an unprecedented frenzy of hype and expectation. But part of what makes Fike so alluring is that he scratches the nebulous aesthetic itch of Gen Z, the first cohort of music fans to largely shed all genre allegiances. Fike is reviving a bygone era of skate and surf-bro rock, but heâs refracting it through the lens of modern hip-hop. Like much successful hip-hop today, âDonât Forget About Meâ is a blunted, nihilistic version of its influences. It features a sound that is fluent in the genre but not beholden to it; Fike slips easily between modes of singing and rap-singing. (Fike also has multiple face tattoos, perhaps the strongest aesthetic signifier among rising hip-hop stars.) Heâs the logical progression from someone like Post Malone, who makes a savvy blend of pure pop, blues-rock, and rap but is often classified as a hip-hop artist simply because of his social and aesthetic preferences. At times, Fikeâs music is almost oppressively low-key: âIâm the king of everything / Make rules up on my own,â he sings on a particularly dreary track, âKing of Everything,â making a kind of dry joke about the very act of self-mythologizing. Like many of his peers, jubilation is not in his emotional wheelhouse.\n\nFike played a number of live shows with his Backhouse collective years ago but has only a few performances to his name as a solo artist. In February, he performed at a small club in Williamsburg, which was filled with what has become, in this nascent stage of his career, his core audience: music critics and label representatives. They wanted to know what all the fuss was about, and for good reason. Fike, after all, is a symbol of the music businessâs newfound momentum. Five years or a decade ago, during the industryâs fallow period, his four-million-dollar deal would have been unthinkable. But in this era of streaming-fuelled prosperityâthe business grew twelve per cent in 2018âthat sort of contract is becoming more and more common. And Fike is a reasonable canvas on which to project fantasies about the future. He can play the guitar and rap, and he can engage a wide range of audiences without particularly satiating any of them.\n\nItâs difficult to express suspicion of Fike without sounding dismissive, curmudgeonly, or overly nostalgic for pre-Internet music fandom. Admittedly, there is something thrilling about him. He seems like a conceptual slam dunk, a triumph of branding and stylistic needle-threading. Onstage in New York, though, where he appeared for about fifteen minutes total, he seemed less like a superhero than like a scrawny kid behind a giant guitar, strumming some lightly catchy songs heâd come up with in his bedroom while dreaming about the future.

Think of Steve Aoki, the electro-house hype man, pumping up the masses at this summerâs Electroland, at Disneyland Paris. Or of Marshmello, the twenty-six-year-old d.j. who wears an enormous emoji-esque mask, and who will, this year and next, provide the soundtrack for the debauchery at the new club Kaos, in Las Vegas, for a rumored sixty million dollars. Mike LÃ©vy, a thirty-one-year-old Frenchman who records as Gesaffelstein, has taken a more ascetic tack. LÃ©vy, one of [electronic musicâs](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/electronic-music) rising stars, has an ear for dance-music history and an affinity for brutalism, as well as a committed disregard for the appetites of the Everyman. His first album, âAleph,â from 2013, was a master class in universe-building. A high-concept tone poem, the record took the frantic, four-on-the-floor rhythms of techno and splattered them with screeching industrial textures, creating a sound that was better suited for the apocalypse than for the festival tent, although it had its place on a certain kind of dance floor nonetheless.\n\nOn âAleph,â the relatively unknown Canadian-born musician ChloÃ© Raunet supplied spoken-word narration, amplifying the albumâs themes of addiction, violence, and self-immolation. âI welcomed old habits like a long lost friend, to spite you,â she said in a hoarse, deadened voice, on âDestinations,â whose menacing low throb built to a paranoid hum, like an approaching killer-bee attack. It was a far cry from the style of the standard electronic-pop album, on which d.j.s deploy a carrousel of chilly-sounding female pop voices over their big-room beats. Raunetâs voice, in concert with the relentless throttle of LÃ©vyâs rhythms, trapped listeners in an adrenalized hellscape they werenât sure they wanted to exit. Amid the booming world of electronic dance music, which has largely become a kind of maximalist but vague orgy, LÃ©vy offers counterprogramming with the specificity of his sound.\n\nAccordingly, LÃ©vy comports himself like a reclusive aesthete, avoiding social media and generally eschewing a public profile. During his live sets, which are infrequent, he tends to wear skinny black suits and a deep grimace; he focusses intently on his work, seldom gesticulating. His cigarettes dangle from his lips until they burn down to the filter. And yet, despite LÃ©vyâs taste for gloomy esoterica, he demonstrates a marked facility for the ways of pop. When [Kanye West,](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/kanye-west) on âYeezus,â took a turn toward the brash and industrial, he invited LÃ©vy into his brain trust. LÃ©vy helped on two of the albumâs centerpiecesâthe hiccupping punk-rap anthem âBlack Skinheadâ and âSend It Up,â a squealing, anxious rallying cry that sounded like a drum circle in an auto-body shop. Abel Tesfaye, who records as [the Weeknd](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/mass-seduction), found an ally in LÃ©vy, using his vigorously dark beats on an EP, âMy Dear Melancholy,â from 2018\\. The fashion-forward New York rapper [A$AP Rocky](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/02/11/rocky-road-2), too, has a fondness for LÃ©vy, using one of the producerâs trademark panicked beats for his song âIn Distress.â For these cool-hunting artists, LÃ©vyâs severe aspect was not a deterrent; it was the point.\n\nAnd so it was not surprising when, late last year, LÃ©vy signed with a major label. In January, he appeared on the announcement of this yearâs [Coachella](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-appeal-of-the-coachella-way-of-life) lineup, his name written in large print next to the chart-topping d.j. Zedd and the elastic global phenomenon Bad Bunny. It was perhaps a sign that the fractured, novelty-hungry mainstream had room for more types of outsidersâor that LÃ©vy was willing to compromise.\n\nAt first glance, LÃ©vyâs new album, âHyperion,â looks like a crossover effort. It has the kind of track list that music blogs like to describe as âstar-studded.â He enlists the vocals of the Weeknd, as well as those of [Pharrell Williams](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/06/waiting-for-pharrell) and *HAIM*{: .small}, two acts whose friendly cheer seems at odds with the style that LÃ©vy has cultivated. (Pharrell was a key figure in the late-career revival of LÃ©vyâs fellow-Frenchmen Daft Punk, singing on the inescapable lite-funk hit âGet Lucky,â from 2013.) But here these artists yield to LÃ©vy, playing bruised and moody versions of themselves. On âBlast Off,â the albumâs excellent pure-pop single, LÃ©vy harks back to the post-disco sounds of âThriller,â using Pharrell as his not altogether convincing spokesman. Pharrell lowers his voice to an obscure hum, chanting a lyric more befitting the manic optimism of early-nineties rave culture than the austere Rust Belt dance music of the late eighties and early nineties that LÃ©vy likes to reference: âWhen Iâm looking in your face, you give me faith,â he says. âI feel this faith. This must be fate.â\n\nMost of the record, particularly its drifty, despondent back half, discards the conventional rhythms of dance music, relying instead on a chromatic, arrhythmic synth-pop haze. The sound is not exactly popular, but itâs influential and ubiquitous nonethelessâindebted to the eighties but largely divorced from any particular era. Itâs the sort of music best suited to movie soundtracks, a major channel of distribution for electronic music in recent decades. Itâs no coincidence that âForever,â the best song on âHyperion,â features Electric Youth, the Canadian band heard on the soundtrack for âDrive,â Nicolas Winding Refnâs brooding, highly stylized thriller. (In 2015, LÃ©vy produced the soundtrack for âDisorder,â a French thriller about a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder.) Much of the record is filled with empty, contemplative space, which can be challenging to sit with. It has all the despondence of LÃ©vyâs earlier work, without any of the horsepowerâa result that feels like the outcome of a battle between LÃ©vyâs stubborn impulses and the expectation that he make main-stage music.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe name Gesaffelstein is a portmanteau combining [Albert Einstein](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/albert-einstein) with the Wagnerian term _Gesamtkunstwerk_, which can be loosely translated as âtotal art work.â (Aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet; Hyperion is the name of an esoteric figure in Greek mythology.) This comically highfalutin self-presentation would be familiar to Kraftwerk, the German act that, in the seventies, legitimatized electronic music, sending an enduring shock wave through popular culture. LÃ©vy is a student of Kraftwerk, and part of his power lies in his ability to create an all-encompassing concept, uniting his music with a distinct visual aesthetic; he often pairs his songs with striking, cinematic videos. Some of LÃ©vyâs work on âHyperionââlike the albumâs bright, pointillistic, eponymous openerâseems like an explicit homage to his German forebears, whose work can often be found in major art museums.\n\nThere are perhaps no musicians whom history has trampled over so forcefully as electronic producers, who are disproportionately burdened by whipsaw shifts in popular taste. Lacking the force of celebrity that typically accompanies marketable vocalists, they can easily be overlooked. Those who try to keep up with the tides of pop music usually do so by capitalizing on trends and aligning themselves with current stars. Even the seemingly too-big-to-fail E.D.M. industry risks becoming obsolete; earnings have declined of late, and the figure of the party-starting festival d.j. has come to feel cartoonish. (Kraftwerk, in fact, is one of the only acts to make it out of the gantlet of electronic music with its legacy intact.) In this era, in which artists live and die by their ability to sell concert tickets, electronic producers have been forced into two schools. One is made up of an underground network of aficionados who perform mostly in smaller clubs in Europe and Asia; the other is part of the cash machine of radio-oriented E.D.M. Rarely does an artist traverse these worlds with ease. Electronic musicâs middle class, of which LÃ©vy can be considered a member, is shrinking.\n\nOn âHyperion,â LÃ©vy steps lightly over the shaky bridge between heritage and modernism, between anonymity and notoriety. Its mix of meditative mood music and in-your-face pop is, at best, a valiant experiment; at worst, itâs a polished but listless attempt. At Coachella, this April, LÃ©vy will return to live performing for the first time in years, appearing on the same stages as Ariana Grande and Dillon Francis, a d.j. known for his crowd-pleasing take on the bleating fusion genre called moombahton. Itâs unclear how LÃ©vy might go about translating something like the ambient, ten-minute song âHumanity Gone,â his albumâs closer, to thousands of distractible festival attendees. (Even more unclear is how heâll fare in a suit, in arid hundred-degree weather.) He may retain his status as a disgruntled outsiderâwhich is to say, heâll feel like himself.Â â¦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"functional-tags":[{"id":"5c7fffef68f3a83129be1f5a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple News Opt In","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple-news-opt-in"},{"id":"5baa883e8688f82d6d666ad0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple News Paid","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple-news-paid"},{"id":"5baa8845956e672d0b2db124","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple News Preview","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple-news-preview"}],"sections":[{"id":"59112013df652b705f4ab93f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pop Music","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pop-music"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a85fdf652b705f4a755c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Carrie Battan began contributing to _The New Yorker_ in 2015, and became a staff writer in 2018.

On Sunday, [Drake](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/drake), after years of strategically avoiding the ceremony, accepted the award for Best Rap Song, for his feel-good anthem âGodâs Plan.â His appearance was a surpriseâplenty of other major artists, among them Ariana Grande and [Childish Gambino](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you), opted out of the show this year. But Drake was on a mission. He used his time on the podium to puncture the performatively convivial surface of the Grammys, effectively telling the crowd that his award was too little, too late. âThe point is, youâve already won if youâve had people who are singing your songs word for word, if youâre a hero in your home town, if there are people with regular jobs coming out in the rain and the snow, spending their hard-earned money to buy tickets to come to your shows, you donât need this right now,â he said. âI promise you, you already won.â\n\nThis was, of course, Drakeâs way of expressing his rightful indignation at being snubbed by the Grammys many times over. But he was not just speaking for himself. His speech was a treatise on the Recording Academyâs long-running failure to keep apace with shifts in the industry, and to properly honor the work of the most commercially and culturally relevant hip-hop artists. If the Grammys canât recognize an artist like Drakeâruthlessly palatable, innovative, and winningâhow can they be trusted to document the culture? The point, Drake was trying to say, is that they cannot. Turn off your televisions and point your attention elsewhere. Itâs time for the Grammys to be left behind altogether. (The broadcast quickly cut to a commercial break.)\n\nThe irony was that this protest came during one of the most forward-thinking and engaging Grammy ceremonies in recent memory. The Recording Academy is usually a punching bag for popular-music fans and artists, who have been frustrated by the showâs stodgy, rock-leaning sensibilities and the lack of diversity among its performers, nominees, and winners. After last yearâs showâwhich featured a single female award presenterâthe show was hashtagged #GrammysSoMale. When confronted about this, last January, the president of the Recording Academy, Neil Portnow, suggested that âwomen who have the creativity in their hearts and soulsâ need to âstep up.â (Portnow later said that his words had been taken out of context.) The frustration bubbled over, forcing the Recording Academy to take some concrete actions to address the criticism. It launched a diversity task force, led by Tina Tchen, Michelle Obamaâs former chief of staff. It opened up the major award categories to include eight nominees, rather than five; months before, it had expanded the Grammysâ voting body to help bridge the gap between those we see winning and those we see dominating the charts. Portnow also announced that he would step down once his contract runs out, this July. During his annual speech at the awards, he spoke about the turbulence his institution has faced. âThis past year Iâve been reminded that, if coming face to face with an issue opens your eyes wide enough, it makes you more committed than ever to help address those issues,â he said. The Grammys want you to know that they are trying.\n\nLast night, at least, those efforts proved surprisingly successful. Plenty of the showâs most compelling moments would have been unthinkable even a year ago. The flamboyant Atlanta hip-hop provocateur Young Thug appeared onstage at the start of the show, as part of a medley with the pop newcomer Camila Cabello, Ricky Martin, and the Colombian pop superstar J Balvin. Later, the Houston rap star Travis Scott, in a performance far more vigorous than his [Super Bowl halftime](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-artless-spectacle-of-maroon-5-at-the-super-bowl) appearance, last week, staged a mosh pit. The showâs host, Alicia Keys, kicked off the ceremony with remarks from an electrifying lineup of Michelle Obama, Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, and Jada Pinkett Smith. A stream of female performers appeared: [Cardi B](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/23/cardi-bs-invasion-of-privacy-is-as-studious-as-it-is-bombastic) delivered a potent, piano-driven rendition of her song âMoney,â and a cast of country-leaning pop-superstar women performed an epic medley with Dolly Parton. If this yearâs Grammys had one theme, it was female empowerment. Keys acted as part host, part doula, referring to the female performers as her sisters while exuding a sense of earthy zen.\n\nThe winners of the awards, too, have finally started to reflect the dramatic evolution of popular music. There were few of the Grammysâ trademark exasperating moments, in which cautious, old-fashioned taste defeats the obvious choice. (See: Beck winning over Kanye West, in 2015, and Adele winning over BeyoncÃ©, in 2016\\.) Childish Gambinoâs â[This Is America](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-carnage-and-chaos-of-childish-gambinos-this-is-america)â took home several awards, while Cardi B became the first woman in the showâs history to win Rap Album of the Year.\n\nIf there was any major miss, it was the near-uniform neglect of [21 Savage](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-shameful-arrest-of-21-savage), the rapper who was detained by *ICE*{:.small} last week and risks being deported for allegedly overstaying his visa. (He was born in the U.K. but has in many ways embodied the American dream.) 21 Savage was nominated for two awards, for the song âRockstar,â a collaboration with Post Malone. The song didnât win either award, but Post Malone performed it in a disjointed mashup with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The song cut out just before 21 Savageâs verse, with not a word from Post Malone about his friend and collaborator. 21 Savageâs mother was not allowed to attend the ceremony on his behalf; few dared to mention his plight onstage. (Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, the Swedish composer who accepted a Grammy on behalf of Childish Gambino, did; Savageâs close friend and champion Drake did not.) His absence was a stark reminder of just how conservative the Grammys remain, and how feeble they truly are as an engine for social change.\n\nOn the podium, several award winners seemed sincerely unprepared to accept their awards. Perhaps they had been trained, rightfully, to distrust the voting process and assume they would be overlooked. When she won Album of the Year, the country-pop star Kacey Musgraves stumbled over her words, struggling to get through a list of thank-yous. Cardi B was rendered speechless for perhaps the first time in her spirited career. âI just want to say thank you to everyone who was involved,â she told the crowd, stunned. Later, she posted a jubilant video on her Instagram that served as an addendum. âIâm sharing this Grammy with you, motherfucker!â she said, referring to the late rapper [Mac Miller](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/the-tragic-death-of-mac-miller-a-musician-who-never-stopped-evolving) and flanked by her ecstatic team, her sister, and her husband, the rapper Offset. The speech was a raucous, improvisational, Internet-first momentâprecisely the type of empowering rhetoric that the Grammys wanted to bottle. It was not a coincidence, perhaps, that it happened offstage.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d50ee7fe02cbd1633fb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cardi B","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cardi-b"},{"id":"5c2e1d9a2396212cbb9fcaa5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drake","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drake"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da17","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Music","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"music"},{"id":"5c2e1ed4aef5062c9d94ab1f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Grammy Awards","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"grammy-awards"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a85fdf652b705f4a755c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Carrie Battan began contributing to _The New Yorker_ in 2015, and became a staff writer in 2018.

Wright Mills was invited to address the International Design Conference, in Aspen. The lecture he gave, âMan in the Middle: The Designer,â criticized a number of its audience members for being willing dupes in the grand illusion that was consumer society. âWants do not originate in some vague realms of the consumerâs personality,â he said. âThey are formed by an elaborate apparatus of jingle and fashion, of persuasion and fraud.â In this sublime hoax, Mills argued, the designer was central. He made people âashamed of last yearâs modelâ; he tied âself-esteemâ with the purchasing of this yearâs model; and he âcreated a panic for status, and hence a panic of self-evaluationâ that could be sated only by the âspecified commoditiesâ that he designed. This was what came to be known as âretail therapyââbut Mills suggested that, partly thanks to designers, it had become fundamental to the American economy. The result was a perversion not just of economic life but also of culture. As he put it, âThe uses of culture are being shaped by men who would turn all objects and qualities, indeed human sensibility itself, into a flow of transient commodities, and these types have now gotten the designer to help them; they have gotten him to turn himself into the ultimate advertising man.â\n\nWhether the conference organizers regretted inviting Mills is not a matter of recordâtoward the end of his lecture, he softened his attack by suggesting that designers could adopt the intimate, use-value virtues of craftsmenâbut I was reminded of his words as I walked around âThe Value of Good Design,â a small display of goods currently on show at the Museum of Modern Art. A curious bit of auto-institutional history, as well as a plug for the museumâs wallet-shredding design store, the âGood Designâ show looks back at the museumâs attempt to establish canons of taste in postwar Americaâto play, in other words, the man in the middle between designers and consumers. As in a suburban shopping mall, the center of the exhibit is a whole car: the huggable Fiat 500, one of the most charming symbols of the Italian postwar âeconomic miracle.â (Unfortunately, there is no contest to win it.) Elsewhere, there is the liquid sheen of Eva Zeiselâs porcelain ware, George Nelsonâs exclamatory atomic-age clock, and a Japanese-influenced bamboo-framed chair from Charlotte Perriand. To view these items is to feel immediately the induction of âwantsâ diagnosed by Mills. This is *MOMA*{: .small}âs second show in a decade about its âGood Designâ program, and it makes one wonder about both the meaning of those terms and what they are meant to do.\n\nThe original âGood Designâ initiative was led by Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., previously the head of *MOMA*{: .small}âs industrial-design department, who collaborated with the Merchandise Mart of Chicago, which was then the largest wholesaler of home goods in the country. From 1950 to 1955, Kauffman, Jr., would put on display goods that were selected from the countryâs best designers. The U.S., in Kauffman, Jr.,âs view, was going to produce a bounty of consumer products one way or the other; he wanted its shoppers to choose tastefully, and to choose modern. In the current show, the âLa Chaiseâ lounge, by Ray and Charles Eames, an emblematic object, is elevated on a pedestal in the corner of a room. It looks like something between a ghost and a cloud, although trying out its rubber-foam shell betrays an unexpected solidity, and the whimsical, scalloped-out circle in the center gives it an open mouth, or an eye. Photographs commissioned to showcase the chair, which was well-received but not put into production until 1990, feature children peering through it: a nice reminder of the Eamesâ abiding interest in environments for play.\n\nIn the past, *MOMA*{: .small} also wanted to show that modern design wasnât expensive, and they ran a series in the nineteen-thirties and forties advertising âUseful Objectsâ that began at less than five dollars. A table of more anonymous products bears out Millsâs critique of desires being artificially fostered while simultaneously eliciting immense pleasure in their satisfaction. An outdoor thermometer with a bright display and an ecstatic font marks seventy degrees as âidealââa gesture toward the good life that design might provide (as well as a quiet plea to move to California). A display stand for oranges, made up of little mounted and adjoined rings, exudes joyful pointlessness: Who would need to manage their oranges this way, except to revel in the sheer pleasure of their display?\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5c868edddf25432cf0528f3a]||||||\n\n+++\n\nAlthough the exhibit does not devote much attention to it, many of these objectsâand the idea of âgood designâ itselfâemerged from the undertow of war. The inner-tube-like ring of Vinylite that makes up the seat of William H. Millerâs inflatable chair came out of wartime pressures to use new kinds of materials. Millerâs direct contribution to the war effort was to create, with the help of Franklin Delano Rooseveltâs cousin, a portable water desalination deviceâundoubtedly a product of good design, in the sense of design that could do some good, but we donât get to see it. A multiscreen display of the landmark Eames film âGlimpses of the USAâ notes that it was part of the American National Exhibition, in Moscow, in 1959, which took place in a geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller. At the exhibition, Vice-President Richard Nixon famously debated Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev inside a model home on the merits of automation in kitchen wares. Khruschev was unmoved by Nixonâs argument, as were several Soviet visitors. âI feel sorry for the Americans, judging by your exhibition,â one wrote in the exhibition guestbook. âDoes your life really consist only of kitchens?â\n\nBeyond the âkitchen debate,â there was a general question in the âgood designâ era, among people on every side of the Cold War, as to whether design actually benefited ordinary peopleâwhether there could be any âgoodâ design when its central aim seemed to be to goose people into buying more stuff. The debate in Europe and the U.S. goes back at least to William Morris, the Victorian proponent of the decorative arts and one of the founders of the English Socialist movement, who rued the shoddiness of industrial products, but also the fact that good work, which ought to have the status of art, was increasingly a luxury. Extending this critique, some designers within the modern movement tried to articulate their dissent through the things they produced. âThe Value of Good Designâ has a number of starkly beautiful objects from Dieter Rams, the German designer whose renowned work for Braun has become emblematic of non-American *gute Form*: cool, understated, low-impact. The pastel coloration, transparency, and minimal decor of his electronics had enormous influence; his products, and his various laconic mission statements on behalf of design, suggested that Cold War consumer societies could still advance a sense of moral clarity.\n\nBut the dialectic of anti-consumer design took a few more turns of the screw. Max Bill, whose minty kitchen clock hangs alongside the work of Rams, founded a ânew Bauhausâ in Ulm, intending, like Rams, to create objects that were durable, quiet, and lasting. The Ulm School of Design was massively influential, but Billâs work became the subject of an attack by the Danish artist Asger Jorn. Jorn, who was involved in founding the school,  saw it finally as another betrayal of the radical Bauhaus, which (at least initially) was about the union of the arts, crafts, and architecture, not product design. Ulm eventually fell apart, partly due to the radicalization of the students against the project that they were ostensibly involved in. They described the consumer society for which they made objects as a form of â*Kommerzterror*,â and at one point sought to rename the school Karl Marx College. It closed in 1968\\. This end to the âgood designâ narrative isnât played out in the exhibit. Instead, in the final room of the show, *MOMA*{: .small} asks you to consider Jasper Morrisonâs plastic stacking chairs as heirs to good designâa prelude to the moment when, retrieving your coat, you receive a text message saying, âDonât miss our Design Store across 53rd street!â\n\nMore than a half-century after Mills delivered his speech, design has become both more pervasive and less responsible. As Alexandra Lange [has written about in these pages](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/what-weve-learned-from-dieter-rams-and-what-weve-ignored), Jony Ive, of Apple, a self-proclaimed adept of Rams, lovingly crafts smooth, chamfered edges for his companyâs world-conquering products. The aesthetic is precise, alluringâbut the objects are designed to meet a suspiciously early obsolescence. Indeed, most of the things that we hold in our hands and stare at, day after day, are examples of âgood designââgreat design, even, in terms of their inextricability from life. But more and more their social benefit seems questionable. As objects they are meant to be replaced, and they function, as Mills warned, as talismans of our own status. What would design look like if its aim werenât profit? The answer is hidden in the margins of the *MOMA*{: .small} show: a device that makes water potableâsomething you canât buy at the design store but which might actually save your life.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1da0397f5b30646d0732","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1da0397f5b30646d0732","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Museum of Modern Art (MOMA)","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"museum-of-modern-art-moma"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Museum of Modern Art (MOMA)","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"museum-of-modern-art-moma"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef00ebe912338a37171f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907ef00ebe912338a37171f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cultural Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cultural-comment"},{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Cultural Comment","parent":[{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"cultural-comment"},{"id":"5b1855718a9b984f9ec9d9f6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5b1855718a9b984f9ec9d9f6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dept. of Design","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dept-of-design"},{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Dept. of Design","parent":[{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"dept-of-design"}],"formatting":[{"id":"5907eefa2179605b11ad1e25","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907eefa2179605b11ad1e25","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lede Image Right Aligned","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lede-image--right-aligned"},{"id":"5904907fc9e5b50e348ceb2c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lede Image Layout","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lede-image-layout"},{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"formatting"}],"name":"Lede Image Right Aligned","parent":[{"id":"5904907fc9e5b50e348ceb2c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lede Image Layout","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lede-image-layout"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"formatting"},"slug":"lede-image--right-aligned"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a7eadf652b705f4a752b","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Nikil Saval is a contributing writer to *The New Yorker,* covering cities, architecture and design.

A number of new town houses, clad in nostalgic, deferential brick, have put at their bases a yawning portal: the garage, an offensive import from the suburbs. Parking in a dense city is always a testy, teeth-grinding experience. But the street-facing garage turns it into something like a crawl through endless desert, each oasis of space a mirage that evaporates as a shutter comes into view. Some of the developments have tried to remedy this problem by creating new streets altogether, perpendicular alleyways that face the garages and are sometimes segregated behind a gate. These succeed only in diminishing the street life of the city.\n\nNo one truly needs a domestic garage to park a car; space is available, if not readily, on city streets. So why do garages exist? The reason may have nothing to do with parking. In their recent book, â[Garage](https://www.amazon.com/Garage-MIT-Press-Olivia-Erlanger/dp/026203834X),â Olivia Erlanger, an artist, and Luis Ortega Govela, an architect, coin a term, âgarageification,â which describes a strange excrescence, initially unrelated to the central functions of the home, acquiring a life of its own and beginning to blend previously separate realms. Garages were, of course, designed to house cars. But they soon became much more: storage spaces, offices, man caves. Entire companies were concocted in a garage, and several styles of music were named after it. The authors of âGarageâ locate themselves in the tradition of the German critic Walter Benjamin, who speculated for more than a thousand pages on Paris shopping arcades as emblems of the nineteenth century. For Erlanger and Ortega Govela, who speculate with more brevity, the garage is a latter-day arcade, a symbol of modernityâor maybe postmodernity.\n\nThe extravagance and curiosity of the early American garage was symbolized, the landscape historian J. B. Jackson noted, in the borrowing of what was obviously a French word for an American phenomenon. Modelled after stables and coach houses, garages were initially detached, for sanitation reasons, from the main home, and could be constructed in the fancy styles of the day; a 1906 *House Beautiful* issue laid out Colonial, Tudor, and Craftsman garages. Often, a second story housed the chauffeur (another French borrowing). But many house designs took pains to hide the garage at the end of a long driveway, or behind a wall. Around the time of the First World War, American cities began to have more prosaic garages, lined up along service alleys, often ransacking the space back yards once occupied.\n\nThe true revolution took place when the garage became an essential part of the house, attached and connected by a door. This made it all but another room. Erlanger and Ortega Govela, looking for the origin of the contemporary garage, find it in an unexpected place: Frank Lloyd Wrightâs Robie House, one of the architectâs original Prairie-style homes, which was completed in 1910 and is still standing, on the South Side of Chicago. Frederick Robie was an entrepreneur, the son of a bicycle manufacturer; his wife, Lora, had come across Wrightâs work in *House Beautiful* and insisted that the two meet, with the hopes that Wright might design their new home. They shared an enthusiasm for new technology: Wright was an early adopter of the automobileâwhen he went to meet Robie, he drove his custom-built yellow Stoddard-Dayton, a low-slung motorized canoe with tall wheels and cartoonishly eyelike headlampsâwhile Robie wanted his father to turn to car manufacturing. For Robieâs house, Wright did away with the habitual front porch and stable, and instead placed, right up front, what may be the worldâs first attached three-car garage. The house announces its integration of the automobile. Erlanger and Ortega Govela note that Wright also eliminated much of the closet space from the house, foreshadowing the eventual move of most storage into the garage, âthe American consumerâs preferred landfill.â For Erlanger and Ortega Govela, Wrightâs garage was ahead of its time, an autonomous object, freighted with ideological momentum, that paved the way for the reshaping of cities around cars and the expansion of the suburbs. This theory counters more common forms of historical explanationâfederal subsidies in the form of highways and suburban housing, for exampleâbut captures something of the monstrous, devouring nature of the American garage.\n\nJust as basements became game rooms, garages, too, became multipurpose. After the Second World War, public transit declined, tracts began to sprawl, and households felt the need to acquire more cars, but home-delivery services also decreased, which meant that houses had to have a washer and dryer and freezer, and an easy way to ferry increasingly larger loads of groceries. Human beings, not designers, changed the meaning of the garage. âOnce home and work are garageified there is an erosion between the domestic and productive spheres, where the dichotomy, language, and aesthetic of home and work borrow from one another,â Erlanger and Ortega Govela write, with academic portentousness. The garage was transformed into a place for storing old bicycles, family albums, and oneâs bulkier board games. It was also foundational to the mythos of Silicon Valley, a retreat for nerds like William Hewlett and David Packard to develop the audio oscillators that gave amplitude to Walt Disneyâs âFantasia.â (The HP Garage is now a private museum, in Palo Alto.) Garages, which once stored the vehicle that took you between work and home, became workspaces that one had *at* home, if not quite *in* the home.\n\nâGarageâ aggressively meanders, in the lurching, free-associative style of cultural studies, from the Robie House to the myth of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, both of them alums of Hewlett-Packard, concocting the first Apple computer in a garage. (Wozniak disputes this story, sourcing most of the original work to his apartment and Jobsâs bedroom.) Garage rock, and Gwen Stefani and No Doubt rehearsing in a garage, are also name-checked, as is the garage as gym, where the last rites of American masculinity are conducted in sweaty privacy. âThe garage without a car lost its prescribed use and became a *deprogrammed* room, a raw residential space that could be easily appropriated for a new set of codes and behaviors that werenât particularly domestic,â Erlanger and Ortega Govela write. In a move at once strange and predictable, they conceive of the Internet as essentially a giant garage. âThe garage was a technology that displaced the home and its subjects,â they write. âNow domesticity is being reformatted once again through technologies that detach the home from the house.â Suggestive as the comparison is, they miss the opportunity to comment on the Internetâs general atmosphere of garage-ness, with its dank memes and moldy conspiracies.\n\nFor Erlanger and Ortega Govela, the garage is an emblem of suburban privatization. But the future of the space may well be in cities, where the number of cars has far exceeded population growth. As the transportation consultant Bruce Schaller [noted](https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2019/01/uber-lyft-make-traffic-worse-more-people-own-cars-transit/579481/) in a recent article, the growth in urban households that are âcar-freeâ is being outpaced by those that are âcar-lightâ (owning one car) or âcar-richâ (owning two or more). Many of these households are in cities where public-transportation options exist alongside the heavy use of âride-shareâ services like Uber and Lyft, which seem to have contributed to the rising number of cars. âFrom mid-2000 to 2012, transit ridership increased while car ownership grew slowly, if at all,â Schaller writes. âBut now car ownership is expanding faster than population. Add in ride-hailing services, and the glut of motor vehicles makes it more difficult to give buses, bikes, and now e-scooters the road space they need to be speedy, safe, and comfortable.â Rather than becoming less dependent on cars, cities have become filled with them. And, just as privatized forms of transportation have ballooned, so might private forms of parking. A civilization that has grown up with garages will not, it seems, dispense with them easily.

The opening moments of Gary Hustwitâs âRams,â about Dieter Rams, is more likely to have you revising your gift list than tossing it out. As the camera pauses on the details of the eighty-six-year-old design legendâs [single-story home](https://www.vitsoe.com/us/voice/home-of-good-design), built in 1971 in Kronberg, Germany, you may find yourself wondering if you, too, need to buy a wall-mounted stereo (the Audio 2/3, designed by Rams for Braun, in 1962-1963) or a boxy leather swivel chair (the 620 armchair, designed by Rams for Vitsoe, in 1962), or to take up the art of bonsai, which Rams practices in his compact, Japanese-inspired garden.\n\nAfter this montage, the sound of birds chirping is replaced by the sound of typing, and we see Rams seated in front of the rare object in his home thatâs not of his own design: the red [Valentine typewriter](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/4576), designed by Ettore Sottsass and Perry King for Olivetti, in 1968. (Rams doesnât own a computer.) If you *listen* to Ramsâspeaking his native German, with subtitlesârather than just look at the elements of his edited world, you will appreciate how his aesthetic and his ethic align. âLess, but better,â the title of [his 1995 book](https://www.amazon.com/Dieter-Rams-Better-English-German/dp/3899555252), is, Rams says, ânot a constraint, it is an advantage which allows us more space for our real life.â\n\nIt is a lesson that Ramsâs many fans in the design world would be wise to heed. Rams is still living with products that he designed or purchased in the nineteen-sixties, whereas we are forced to upgrade our buttonless rectangles every few years. He is also responsible for the dominant technological aesthetic of our age: smoothness. And now is a particularly good time to contemplate his legacy: â[Rams](https://www.hustwit.com/rams/)â will be released on Wednesday and the exhibition â[Dieter Rams: Principled Design](https://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/883.html)â is at the Philadelphia Museum of Art through April, 2019.\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5bfc71bda080342cdf810c52]||||||\n\n+++\n\nOn the wall that welcomes visitors to the show, the exhibition designer Jamie Montgomery has blown up a circular grille from Ramsâs RT 20 tabletop radio (1961) to state, as the âPrincipled Designâ curator Colin Fanning put it, âDetails matter.â Rams says in Hustwitâs movie that he will never retire; heâs still working with Vitsoe on potential new products and reissues. But, if he had to do it all over, he might think about design at a different scale. At a 2016 talk in Munich, shown at the start of the film, the designer Fritz Frenkler asked Rams what path he would choose if he were starting his career today, and Rams points to landscape architecture, because âshaping our environment is the most important thing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This starts with the landscape, not with the design of a machine.â\n\nWhen an audience member at the panel asked him about Tesla, he said,âWe donât need anything faster.â (Rams drives a Porsche.) âWe need to rethink the entire transportation system.â Not cars, but traffic.\n\nRams was born in 1932. In 1955, after training as an architect, he went to work for Braun, the consumer-electronics company, which was then run by a pair of brothers, Erwin and Artur Braun. The brothers realized that they had a tremendous opportunity in the postwar world: to unite progressive design with new advances in engineering and materials. They partnered with the new [Ulm School of Design](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2018/04/16/less-but-better/) and hired many of its graduates, seeking a functional look for the elements of contemporary life: stereo systems, radios, slide projectorsâproducts that were often white as milk and crisp as pocket squares. Rams was the head of design at Braun from 1961 to 1995. Along the way, he was also instrumental in the success of the furniture company Vitsoe, which launched Ramsâs 606 Universal Shelving System, in 1960, and never stopped producing it. \n\nHustwitâs Rams movie and Fanningâs Rams show evoke the aesthetic of the designerâs products. But fetishization isnât the point that audiences should take away. âIn reality the design is meant to disappear; it is meant to be the structure for everyday life,â Fanning says, echoing the fifth principle in Ramsâs oft-invoked Ten Principles of Good Design: âGood design is unobtrusive.â \n\nI would have loved to see some #shelfies in the film or the exhibit, demonstrating how much stuff, and of what marvelous variety, one might organize on a wall of Vitsoe 606 modules. How do they hold up? Why do people love them? Can they be assembled, as Rams hoped, without a manual? I wanted to see his products in the wild, his designs dealing with mess. Hustwit, in his directorâs statement, says he wanted to make his film uncluttered, without endless encomiums from other designers, but the result feels visually hermetic, repressed, in a way that Rams himself is not, especially when discussing failures of design.\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5bfc71bd7874432cd584691b]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe filmâs peak comes when Rams is let loose in the Vitra Design Museumâs [Schaudepot](https://www.design-museum.de/en/collection/vitra-schaudepot.html), a giant house-shaped structure that houses some twenty thousand objects. Rams, gesturing with his Nanna Ditzel-designed cane, takes us on a tour, rapping approvingly on a Hans Wegner chair, nodding at Charles and Ray Eamesâs E.S.U. shelving, shrugging at the Marshmallow sofa of George Nelson & Associates. (Nelson was a friend, Rams says, but, âgenerally it is too playful for me.â) When told that Marc Newsonâs Lockheed Lounge is the most expensive piece of design ever sold at auction ([one sold for two million pounds, in 2015](https://www.dezeen.com/2015/04/29/marc-newson-lockheed-lounge-new-auction-record-design-object-phillips/)), he shakes his head sadly. âIt leads to misunderstandings. Suddenly we hear, âDesign just means expensive.â&nbsp;â Mateo Kries, the director of the Vitra Design Museum, seems delighted by Ramsâs critical firecrackers. âHeâs also from that generation where designers dared to say, âThis, in my opinion, is bad design.â Today you would more often hear, âThis is interesting.â&nbsp;â When you are eighty-six, why mince words? \n\nI remembered loving Hustwitâs first design documentary on another ubiquitous yet unseen monument of modernism, âHelvetica,â so I went back and re-watched it. Between visits to Helvetica-loving designers of multiple generations, Hustwit films Helvetica on posters, Helvetica in stores, Helvetica on planes, Helvetica in the New York City subway. Suddenly, the background music became the symphony.\n\nThe closest we get to user experience in âRamsâ is an interview with Naoto Fukasawa, one of the three contemporary designers whom Rams admires. We see Fukasawa in his own monochrome home, touching, for the first time, the T3 pocket transistor radio designed by Rams for Braun, in 1958. The moment you see his fingers on the circular frequency dial set opposite a square speaker, you make the mental leap to the iPod that [Jony Ive](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come) and the Apple industrial-design team produced, in 2001. The click wheel was here, in an earlier, chunkier pocket music device. Ive has always acknowledged his debt to Rams (he contributed a foreword to Sophie Lovellâs book â[Dieter Rams: As Little Design as Possible](https://www.phaidon.com/store/design/as-little-design-as-possible-9780714849188)â) but, as the Philadelphia exhibition text suggests, Ive, embedded within Appleâs upgrade cycle, may have missed the point: âthe rapid obsolescence and environmental impact of these devices sits uneasily against Ramsâs advocacy of long-lasting, durable design.â \n\nThe minute design twitches of each yearâs Apple launch are a far cry from the revolutionary change that the click wheel ushered in. Newfangled ports, rose-gold backs, the elimination of the home buttonâthese donât change our relationships to our phones, except to annoy. Seeing Fukasawaâs hands on the T3, I am reminded again that Apple is no longer making small phones for those of us who are perfectly comfortable with our small hands. The technological future Rams imagined in 1958 was tactile and user-friendly. Dongles would horrify him.\n\nI recently read John Carreyrouâs book, â[Bad Blood](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X),â about the exposure of the Theranos fraud, and realized that Ramsâs influence, via Apple, had been passed on to a new generation as an aesthetic rather than as an ethic. Theranosâs Elizabeth Holmes hired designers from the Apple team, and insisted for years that her blood-testing system fit inside a tabletop monochrome boxâas if a toaster and a laboratory could and should look the same. \n\nRamsâs collaborator on the ET55 calculator (1980), [Dietrich Lubs](https://www.dezeen.com/2017/09/18/braun-philosophy-about-reducing-bling-bling-watch-clock-designer-dietrich-lubs-interview/), who is interviewed in the film, says that the Braun designers âwere trying to eliminate the need for user manuals.â The new-products division at Braun, founded in the mid-sixties, focussed on new categories of objects for personal grooming and the desktop, which required even more attention to shape, color, and tactility. In a world where the On button is endangered, thereâs something wonderfully clear about Rams and Lubsâs calculatorâs green On and red Off buttons, rounded to meet the fingertip. In a world where even home coffeemakers bristle with nozzles and switches, thereâs something wonderfully soothing about the Braun kitchen appliances, most of which have a single toggle switch. A few years back, frustrated by the chaos of my countertop, I ordered a vintage KF 20 coffee machine (designed by Florian Seiffert, in 1972) from eBay, and put it to work. It had a smaller footprint and simpler lines than any electric machine on the market today.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/5bfc71bd7c5f4c2cea75a0df]||||||\n\n+++\n\nMark Adams, the managing director of Vitsoe, collects such stories from customers (and uses a KF 20 himself). At the Philadelphia museum opening, he told me that heâs had customers put their 606s in their willsââMake sure you get the shelves after Iâm goneââand has been asked by lawyers to value units in divorce proceedings. âThough of course,â he is quick to mention, as a modular system âit can easily be split.â It is this kind of story I wish there were more of in âRamsââmoments when inanimate objects inspire passionate emotion and artifacts of the recent past become heirlooms. Hereâs a happier Rams story, also courtesy Adams: two lonely souls went looking for love after broken marriages. When they eventually went home together, they found they both had off-white 606s on their walls. Their subsequent cohabitation was written in the shelves.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c872710c62d10815426","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Design","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"design"},{"id":"5c2e1ca42396212cbb9fc9d0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Modernism","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"modernism"},{"id":"5c2e1ca436cecf4019214219","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"technology"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef00ebe912338a37171f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cultural Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cultural-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a03a02179605b11ad9978","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/alexandra-lange","email":"","name":"Alexandra Lange","socialMedia":[],"title":"Alexandra Lange is the architecture critic for Curbed and the author of â[The Design of Childhood: How the Material World Shapes Independent Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Childhood-Material-Shapes-Independent/dp/1632866358).â"}]},"dek":"","hed":"What Weâve Learned from Dieter Rams, and What Weâve Ignored","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2018-11-28T17:16:54.007Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5bfc71bde261232d2616f115","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:2":{"width":696,"height":696,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":1406,"y":168,"height":696,"width":696}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2560,"height":1440,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":132,"height":1440,"width":2560}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":2271,"height":1703,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":288,"y":2,"height":1703,"width":2271}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1706,"height":1706,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":841,"y":0,"height":1706,"width":1706}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2018/11/26/5bfc71bde261232d2616f114_Lange-Dieter-Rams_01.jpg","width":2560,"height":1706,"duration":null}},"caption":"Dieter Rams, circa nineteen-seventies.

At the same time, a petition with five million signatures was circulated, asking the government to revoke Article 50 of the European Unionâs Lisbon Treaty, which allows member states to withdraw from the E.U. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, an arch-Brexiteer and the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, was sponsoring an almost three-hundred-mile march across England, demanding the strictest possible withdrawal under the slogan âLeave means leave.â The march finally arrived in London on Friday, March 29nd, which was expected to be Brexit Day. Instead, on that Friday, Prime Minister [Theresa May](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/theresa-may)âs negotiated exit was rejected, for the third time, by Parliament. The mounting political chaos of that whole Brexit week left Britain with an utterly unpredictable political future and the looming possibility of economic chaos. \n\nI was in England that week, watching demonstrators in the street: angry, boisterous, distressed, disconsolate, some waving the starred flag of the E.U., some draped in the Union Jack. I appreciated the depth of the crisis, but I was there for a different reason. In the world of opera, that same week in London saw a set of sensational performances at the Royal Opera House, in Covent Garden: Giuseppe Verdiâs challenging masterpiece âLa Forza del Destino,â bringing together the two most acclaimed superstars of the contemporary opera world, the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko and the German tenor Jonas Kaufmann. These performances were instantly sold out, with tickets being scalped for thousands of pounds and operagoers gathering from all over the world during what also just happened to be the crisis of Brexit week. \n\nIn addition to the Russian and German superstars, the baritone, Ludovic TÃ©zier, is French; the basso, Ferruccio Furlanetto, is Italian; the director, Christof Loy, is German; and the conductor, Antonio (Tony) Pappano, is Anglo-Italian.  The audience included people speaking every European language. Opera, as a high-brow art form, has always been thoroughly European, in its performers, venues, public, and artistic inspiration. This was true in the early eighteenth century, when the German composer George Frideric Handel wrote Italian operas in London. It was true in the eighteen-sixties, when Verdi wrote âLa Forza del Destino,â based on a Spanish drama, for a premiÃ¨re in St. Petersburg, starring a French soprano. âForza,â at the Royal Opera House, received rapturous acclamation during a week of fierce political demonstrations, which points to a bitter irony of the current crisis: that Europe, united at the level of Ã©lite culture, is hopelessly divided and embattled in the sphere of mass politics. Indeed, the fierce anti-Europeanism of economically uncertain Britons, who were swayed by populist demagogues to support the Brexit referendum, might even be partly directed against precisely the sort of prosperous, cosmopolitan European operagoers who converged on Covent Garden this week in a spirit of artistic communion.\n\nSet in the eighteenth century, âForzaâ revolves around three principal figures who spend the opera pursuing one another across southern Europe, lost in a continent at war, chasing one another for reasons of both passion and deadly hatred, before theyâre finally and fatally brought together, in the last act, by âla forza del destino,â the force of destiny. The tenor, Don Alvaro, is an Incan prince who can never be accepted as a European nobleman worthy of the love of the soprano, Leonora di Vargas, especially after he accidentally murders her father in the course of a failed elopement. Her brother, Don Carlo, the baritone, pursues them both with the purpose of avenging his fatherâs death, and, while Leonora takes refuge in a church, among Franciscans, Don Carlo and Don Alvaro end up in Italy, as soldiers in the army, and begin a passionate friendship, not knowing that they are sworn enemies.\n\nBoth Netrebko and Kaufmann brought some of their national cultures to their roles in this Italian opera. Netrebko created a Dostoyevskian Leonora, whose intense piety and craving for atonement were laced with voluptuous, sensual vocal coloring. Her Leonora pleaded for peace (in the aria âPace, paceâ) even while remaining an irresistible magnet for violent passions. Netrebkoâs performance was a reminder that Verdi composed this opera for Dostoyevskyâs St. Petersburg, in the eighteen-sixties, the decade of the great Petersburg novel â[Crime and Punishment](https://www.amazon.com/Crime-Punishment-Fyodor-Dostoyevsky/dp/0486415872),â a title that would also have worked for âLa Forza del Destino.â Kaufmann brought to Don Alvaro the lonely longing of the outcast Volsung Siegmund, from Wagnerâs âDie WalkÃ¼re,â recognizable here in the guise of Verdiâs Incan wanderer, far from Peru, denounced as a savage in Europe, searching far and wide for the woman who loves him but will always be forbidden to him. Lonely soul that he is, Don Alvaro expresses his passionate longing through duetsâwith Leonora, of course, but also with Don Carlo, his only friend and also his deadly enemy. Indeed, the magnificent Verdian duets between the tenor and baritone suggest that Don Alvaro is scarcely less passionate about Don Carlo than about Carloâs sister. \n\nThe loneliness of Don Alvaro reminds us that he is an operatic wanderer, an immigrant, and immigration is an obsessive preoccupation that has hovered over the Brexit referendum and crisis from the beginning. In Britain, as in America, it has been very difficult for political Ã©lites to come to terms with the virulently xenophobic feelings of many ordinary people in difficult economic times. Antonio Pappano, the music director of the Royal Opera House, is himself the son of Italian immigrants to Britain, and, working with Kaufmann, created a particularly moving portrait of an outcast immigrant in search of acceptance. In Italy, the government is dominated by the Lega, a fiercely xenophobic party whose leader, Matteo Salvini, becomes ever more popular as he denounces Europe and immigration; at the same time, in the spirit of cultural nationalism, the Lega embraces Verdi as a national icon. \n\nYet Verdi was always chorally sympathetic to outsiders, from exiled Hebrews, in âNabucco,â to itinerant Gypsies, in âIl Trovatore.â There is a disturbing, inflammatory Gypsy figure in âLa Forza del Destino,â Preziosilla, who incites the choral crowd to sing, with bellicose enthusiasm, for the ongoing war. Though we know that Don Alvaro and Don Carlo are fighting as military comrades, one of the puzzlements of the opera is how to understand the gloriously intense and totally serious passions of the soloistsâlove, honor, revengeâin relation to the almost frivolously carnivalesque jingoism of the chorus. Yet this problem of dramatic incongruity appears strangely relevant to the current moment; the intensely self-involved preoccupations of the Ã©lite operatic characters render them blind to the casual ferocity of the hard-drinking, war-loving chorus. When the chorus sings âViva la pazzia!â (Long live insanity!), during a drunken celebration of the war, the Franciscan Fra Melitone, performed by the wonderful Italian baritone Alessandro Corbelli, denounces the crowd as sinners, as the very reason that there will never be peace in the world. \n\nThis dramatic moment was perhaps uncomfortably relevant to those of us in the opera house, in London, caught up in the magnificent emotions imagined by Verdi and brought to the stage with supreme vocal charisma by Netrebko and Kaufmann. We allowed ourselves to be, for the duration of the performance, oblivious to the political insanity raging outside of the opera house, reflecting a hatred of immigrants, a hatred of Europe, and, perhaps, a hatred of Ã©lite European culture itself as summed up, in its very essence, by the opera. \n\nâEverything is in confusion,â Fra Melitone sings. That was also true for the world outside of the opera house during Brexit week. As many have commented, English political life is hurtling âdown the rabbit hole,â and itâs perhaps worth noting that âLa Forza del Destino,â in 1862, was an unlikely cultural sibling of that quintessentially British masterpiece â[Aliceâs Adventures in Wonderland](https://www.amazon.com/Alices-Adventures-Wonderland-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486275434),â which Lewis Carroll began writing in that same year and was published soon after, in 1865\\. Brexit is the maddest of mad tea parties, and, if, somewhere, the Cheshire Cat is grinning at the confusion, we are unlikely to enjoy the humor anytime soon. Brexit will not end, like the opera, with curtain calls and applause for the superstars.

Not Dominick Argento, Americaâs leading composer of lyric opera, who [died last week](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/obituaries/2019/02/22/dominick-argento-composer-who-was-modern-master-opera/usJ4wOV8SOOUHQRrKJ8A4J/story.html), at ninety-one, at his home in Minneapolis, a city that embraced and supported his music and career for more than half a century. Because I was one of his last students in composition at the University of Minnesota (he completed his long career there, in 1997), I developed a certain angle on the man and his enduring music.\n\nThe term âlyricâ fuels the approbation âlyrical,â meaning music that is attractive, melodic, and grateful on the ear. In other words, pretty. Thereâs a lot of pretty music around these days, but beautifulâbeauty that radiates from the musicâs very bonesâis something much more rare. Argentoâs best music has this. It springs not only from his interlocking mastery of every element of classical compositionâharmony, counterpoint, orchestration, formâbut from his acute sensitivity to the setting of words and a deep understanding of how human emotion is translated into rhythm and tone. That understanding came partly from the fact that his wife, Carolyn Bailey, was an operatic soprano of considerable talent who served as her husbandâs critic, adviser, and muse. But it also came from Argentoâs connection to the great lyric tradition, a line that goes back to the beginnings of opera, in seventeenth-century Venice. \n\nHe was linked to this tradition in a fundamental way that Americaâs two leading operatic paragons, John Adams and Philip Glass, are not. To be fair, their music is more sui generis; in such minimalist masterpieces as âNixon in Chinaâ and âSatyagraha,â molds were broken and new, specifically American traditions were formed. Argentoâs music, however, strives not for originality but for sympathy. In a work like âThe Aspern Papersââhis supreme opera, a daring adaptation of the Henry James novella for which he made his own librettoâArgento records the quick and subtle fluctuations of his charactersâ emotions while maintaining an unbreakable underlying flow of energy and melodic line. (When I teach Monteverdiâs mini-opera âCombattimento di Tancredi e Clorindaâ to my students, in Nashville, I hear Dominickâs music, buried deep.) âNixonâ may be an even greater opera than âAspern,â but Adamsâs Dick Nixon would be a hectoring cardboard cutout without Alice Goodmanâs rich, pliant, and multi-referential text. His music and her words move in tandem, joined for mutual advantage. But in Argentoâs resurrection of Jamesâs Jeffrey Aspernânow a composer, not a writerâthe fusion is intimate, seamless, and complete.\n\nâAspernâ got a glorious, star-studded world-premiÃ¨re production at the Dallas Opera, in 1988. (The PBS âGreat Performancesâ telecast has long been available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZEBm1SoQnQ). Itâs a fine eveningâs entertainment, with a bottle of Barolo nearby.) The operaâs first seven minutes refine a technique that Argento had foreshadowed in his two renowned monodramas for voice and piano, â[From the Diary of Virginia Woolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=VmUgvQJXfbs)â (written for Janet Baker, in 1974) and âThe AndrÃ©e Expeditionâ (1982).  Listen to how the music unfolds: passages that slyly verge on atonality are linked like gossamer chains to hinge moments of pure tonal euphony, each expressing a clear dramatic point. I like to think of it as âcanal formâ: you may stroll along the stone shoulders of Venetian waterways for many an absentminded moment, but you can wander only so far before reaching one of those consoling yellow signs, like â*ALLA FERROVIA*{:.small}â or â*PER RIALTO*{:.small},â that direct you back to the place the city fathers intended. (After Florence, Venice was Argentoâs favorite European city.)\n\nThese two contrasting impulsesâthe yearning for fantasy and the necessity of controlâform the fulcrum of Argentoâs art, and help explain why the composer and his community found one other so appealing. In 1971, Argento, teaming up with some of the talented colleagues with which, under the umbrella of the Walker Art Center, he had founded the Center Opera of Minnesota (which eventually became the Minnesota Opera), created âPostcard from Morocco,â a surreal chamber opera that was as valid a contribution to the American avant-garde as were the more fractiously provocative speech-operas of Robert Ashley. (Some of that avant-garde spirit leeched into âIn Praise of Music,â from 1977, Argentoâs finest work for orchestra.) The piece made his national reputation, but audiences, unlike critics, were not uniformly approving of it, and Argento never went that âfar outâ again. As Mary Ann Feldman, the annotator, lecturer, and all-around eminence blanche of the Minnesota Orchestra for several decades, put it in 1999, âEdoââde Waart, the orchestraâs music director from 1986 to 1995ââcame here thinking that because Minneapolis is the home of the Walker Art Center and a lot of experimental theatre, audiences would be receptive to bold contemporary programming. Well, theyâre not.â (In a poetic twist, Feldman died just two days before Argento did, Lee Radziwill to his [Karl Lagerfeld](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/karl-lagerfeld-the-designer-who-dressed-to-survive).) \n\nArgento, a warm and brilliant but tough-minded man from a working-class background, understood this, I think, and âVirginia Woolfââwhich won the Pulitzer Prize that âPostcardâ had laid the groundwork forâmarks, for all its durable satisfactions, a cunning tactical retreat. Argentoâs melodic gift, while fluent and abundant, was not quite as distinctive as those of Samuel Barber and Ned Rorem, the two American neo-Romantics with whom he is most easily compared. But his dramatic instincts were far more sure. Under his watchful care, characters in extreme situationsâthe isolated, suicidal Woolf, the doomed polar explorers of âThe AndrÃ©e Expedition,â Aspernâs crazed and aged lover, Juliana Bordereauâbecome domesticated and relatable, and, getting to know them, we feel a little less extreme ourselves. Argentoâs works are elegant and deftly fashioned vessels for their souls.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c93397f5b30646d0617","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Classical

decade ago, the residents of the English village of Broughton, in Buckinghamshire, formed a human chain to block an intruder. A car with a camera mounted on its roof was about to immortalize Broughtonâs country lanes for Google Street View, which has photographed more than ten million miles of streets around the world. The car, having halted in front of the protesters, beat a retreat when one of them called the police. The story made the rounds of the international media, often treated as an instance of English eccentricity, snootiness, or small-town paranoia. It surfaced again the following year, when the German Federal Commission for Data Protection revealed that Street View vehicles were not only photographing peopleâs homes but also collecting vast amounts of data from unencrypted Wi-Fi routersâincluding e-mails, chat sessions, browser histories, and passwords. Peter Schaar, Germanyâs data-protection commissioner, said, âI am shocked at the way these routes were used without third parties being aware of them.â \n\nShoshana Zuboff, a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, mentions the citizens of Broughton more than once in her book â[The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697)ââa reckoning with the stranglehold that Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other Big Tech companies exert over our lives and minds. In retrospect, whatâs striking about the âSpy-Fiâ scandal, as it was called, is how isolated it was. Although it generated shocked headlines, no general uprising ensued. Google apologized, saying that the data collection was inadvertent, that a rogue engineer had devised the technology, and that nothing was done with the data. Street View eventually broached the barricades in Broughton. You can take a remote tour of the village today.\n\nâThe Age of Surveillance Capitalismâ joins a small library of books chronicling the ill effects of Internet economics and culture: Jaron Lanierâs â[You Are Not a Gadget](https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-Gadget-Manifesto/dp/0307389979),â Nicholas Carrâs â[The Shallows](https://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393339750),â Astra Taylorâs â[The Peopleâs Platform](https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-Platform-Taking-Culture-Digital/dp/0805093567),â Sherry Turkleâs â[Alone Together](https://www.amazon.com/Alone-Together-Expect-Technology-Other/dp/0465031463),â Evgeny Morozovâs â[The Net Delusion](https://www.amazon.com/Net-Delusion-Dark-Internet-Freedom/dp/1610391063),â and dozens of others. Zuboffâs work is likely to have a longer life than most, not only because she deploys an indispensable termâsurveillance capitalism is defined as âa new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and salesââbut because her arguments are backed by staggeringly thorough documentation. This is no thin polemical screed, although the tone is often impassioned. Weighing in at nearly seven hundred pages, the book is a step-by-step account of the building of the digital iron cage.\n\nTwo major questions loom over the story that Zuboff unfolds. The firstâHow did Big Tech pull it off?âis answered in excruciating and infuriating detail. She traces a relentless progression from data collection to behavior prediction and finally to behavior control. The secondâWhy did we let them do it?âis more elusive, although Zuboff ventures some good guesses. She quotes Hannah Arendt and George Orwell; she talks about the instinct to bow before power, particularly before a supremely confident power. The seductive ease of life under surveillance capitalism has so far stilled the countervailing instinct to defy the bully, to protect the sliver of the self. \n\nNeoliberal economics enabled the rise of the tech giants, as Zuboff makes clear at the outset. From the late nineteen-seventies onward, regulators were crippled and the corporate sector emboldened. No strong system of oversight was in place as Big Tech began its invasion of privacy. Google is the focus of the early part of the narrative. The company had devised a superior search engine but lacked a stable business model. After the tech crash of 2000, Google, under pressure from investors, looked for ways to increase revenue. Almost by accident, it discovered the benefits of âbehavioral surplusââthe detritus of data that users leave behind when they visit the site. User profiles allowed Googleâs clients to target their ads precisely. This was the origin of the intelligence-gathering capability that has made the Internet such a pervasively spooky placeâits way of knowing whether your query about âGiants ticketsâ means baseball in San Francisco or football in New York.\n\nClose scrutiny of a patent that Google filed at the end of 2003ââGenerating User Information for Use in Targeted Advertisingââallows Zuboff to establish that user profiles were âdeducedâ or âextractedâ from personal data that users may have wished to keep hidden. Deduction is itself a euphemism. Google wasnât Sherlock Holmes, inferring peopleâs professions from indentations on their hands; it simply vacuumed up information, overriding an ethic of privacy that had become enshrined in American law and culture. That mentality is all but universal in the world of Big Tech. Zuboff calls it the principle of âradical indifference,â according to which the masters of the digital universe act without regard for the social consequences of their actions. Eric Schmidt, the former C.E.O. of Google, announced in his book âNew Digital Age,â co-written with Jared Cohen, that âthe online world is not truly bound by terrestrial laws.â \n\nThe success of Googleâs surveillance regime depended on the sheer numbers of people using it. Machine intelligence, Zuboff explains, âreaches its full potential for quality only as it approximates totality.â For this reason, the tendency toward all-devouring monopolies in the tech world is the inevitable outcome of the underlying algorithmic logic. Tech companies can really succeed only when they establish a monopoly over whatever zone of the economy they occupy: books, media, music streaming, movie streaming. One of the saddest aspects of life under Big Tech is our habit of equating entire sectors of human activity with particular corporations. Shopping becomes Amazon. Movies become Netflix. Music becomes Spotify. Friendship becomes Facebook. That urge to brand the basic functions of daily existence justifies the bookâs citations of Arendt and the [Frankfurt School](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/15/naysayers) on the psychology of totalitarianism. \n\nTo be sure, Big Tech encountered resistance each step of the way. Its response has repeatedly followed what Zuboff calls the âdispossession cycleâ: a sequence of maneuvers by which a company takes what it wants and grinds down obstructions in its path. First comes âincursionâ: the act of seizing undefended territory without regard for existing laws and norms, whether itâs personal data, cars for hire, rooms for rent, or the contents of libraries. Not only the company but also its consumers must set aside moral qualms. Zuboffâs decision to begin her account with Google in 2000 means that she neglects the earlier history of radical indifference on the Internetânotably, Napsterâs normalization of copyright violation, in 1999\\. A lawsuit halted Napster, in 2001, but it set an example. Sean Parker, its co-founder, went on to become Facebookâs first president.\n\nIn the face of organized opposition, the company practices âhabituationâ: wearing down challengers through years of litigation, media misdirection, and political manipulation, until the land grab becomes established fact. In the face of general public dismay, the company deploys âadaptationâ: a performance of contrition, apologizing for regrettable mishaps and promising improvements. âWe failed badly here,â Google said after the Street View controversy. âWe are mortified by what happened.â Facebook has [perfected the same song and dance](https://www.wired.com/story/why-zuckerberg-15-year-apology-tour-hasnt-fixed-facebook/). Mark Zuckerberg, the companyâs co-founder and C.E.O., had it down when he was a Harvard undergraduate, apologizing to womenâs groups for his Facemash experiment. âI definitely see how my intentions could be seen in the wrong light,â he said. Finally comes âredirection,â in which the problematic initiative not only fails to stop but expands in scope. As Zuboff points out, the very idea of privacy is antithetical to the viability of a corporation like Google or Facebook. \n\nWhenever Zuboff seems in danger of pushing her argument too far, evoking a dystopia overseen by messianic megalomaniacs, the principals of her narrative bolster her case by spouting dialogue that sounds as if it had been crafted by a particularly desperate Hollywood writerâs room. Tech leaders envision creating a âhuman-machine symbioteâ and building a âworld-spanning living organism.â A Silicon Valley data scientist tells Zuboff, âThe goal of everything we do is to change peopleâs actual behavior at scale.â Hal Varian, Googleâs chief economist, imagines what might happen if you fall behind in your car-leasing payments: âNowadays itâs a lot easier just to instruct the vehicular monitoring system not to allow the car to be started and to signal the location where it can be picked up.â Eric Schmidt said, in 2010, âWe know where you are. We know where youâve been. We can more or less know what youâre thinking about.â The âweâ connotes a class of superior beings who know what is best for the rest of humanity.\n\nZuboff ends her book with a fairly rousing call to rise against what she calls a âcoup from above.â Create friction, she says. Demand oversight of the kind that the European Union has put in place, most recently with a [$1\\.7 billion fine of Google](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/google-fine-advertising.html). Campaign for antitrust action, as Senator [Elizabeth Warren has proposed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html). Refuse the fatalism that makes people shrug their shoulders and say there is nothing to be done about any of it. History shows a way forward:\n\n> The decades of economic injustice and immense concentrations of wealth\n> that we call the Gilded Age succeeded in teaching people how they did\n> not want to live. That knowledge empowered them to bring the Gilded\n> Age to an end, wielding the armaments of progressive legislation and\n> the New Deal. Even now, when we recall the lordly âbaronsâ of the late\n> nineteenth century, we call them ârobbers.â Surely the Age of\n> Surveillance Capitalism will meet the same fate as it teaches us how\n> *we* do not want to live.\n\nIndeed, most of us donât want to live like this, heads bent over a handheld device, twitching from one social-media outlet to another. Insidiously, though, the technologies that mediate our existence provide an illusory sense of mastery, as we tap a screen and summon brightly colored sweaters to our door. âThe precise moment at which our needs are met,â Zuboff writes, âis also the precise moment at which our lives are plundered for behavioral data.â We find ourselves in an elegantly designed, frictionless trap.\n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c84ee7fe02cbd163345","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c84ee7fe02cbd163345","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Google","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"google"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Google","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"google"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"technology"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Technology","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"technology"},{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"books"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef00ebe912338a37171f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907ef00ebe912338a37171f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cultural Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cultural-comment"},{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Cultural Comment","parent":[{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"cultural-comment"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a044b2179605b11ad9992","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Alex Ross has been the music critic at *The New Yorker* since 1996\\.

Hide the WD-40\\. Lock up your nine-volt batteries. Build a booby trap out of giant magnets; dig a moat as deep as a grave. âEver since a study by the University of Oxford predicted that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence over the next fifteen to twenty years, I havenât been able to stop thinking about the future of work,â AndrÃ©s Oppenheimer writes, in â[The Robots Are Coming: The Future of Jobs in the Age of Automation](https://www.amazon.com/Robots-Are-Coming-Future-Automation/dp/0525565000/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Robots+Are+Coming%3A+The+Future+of+Jobs+in+the+Age+of+Automation&qid=1551108903&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Vintage). No one is safe. Chapter 4: âTheyâre Coming for Bankers!â Chapter 5: âTheyâre Coming for Lawyers!â Theyâre attacking hospitals: âTheyâre Coming for Doctors!â Theyâre headed to Hollywood: âTheyâre Coming for Entertainers!â I gather they have not yet come for the manufacturers of exclamation points.\n\nThe old robots were blue-collar workers, burly and clunky, the machines that rusted the Rust Belt. But, according to the economist Richard Baldwin, in â[The Globotics Upheaval: Globalization, Robotics, and the Future of Work](https://www.amazon.com/Globotics-Upheaval-Globalization-Robotics-Future/dp/0190901764/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Globotics+Upheaval%3A+Globalization%2C+Robotics%2C+and+the+Future+of+Work&qid=1551108918&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Oxford), the new ones are âwhite-collar robots,â knowledge workers and quinoa-and-oat-milk globalists, the machines that will bankrupt Brooklyn. Mainly, theyâre algorithms. Except when theyâre immigrants. Baldwin calls that kind âremote intelligence,â or R.I.: theyâre not exactly robots but, somehow, they fall into the same category. Theyâre people from other countries who can steal your job without ever really crossing the border: they just hop over, by way of the Internet and apps like Upwork, undocumented, invisible, ethereal. Between artificial intelligence and remote intelligence, Baldwin warns, âthis international talent tidal wave is coming straight for the good, stable jobs that have been the foundation of middle-class prosperity in the US and Europe, and other high-wage economies.â Change your Wi-Fi password. Clear your browser history. Ask H.R. about early retirement. The globots are coming.\n\nHow can you know if youâre about to get replaced by an invading algorithm or an augmented immigrant? âIf your job can be easily explained, it can be automated,â Anders Sandberg, of Oxfordâs Future of Humanity Institute, tells Oppenheimer. âIf it canât, it wonât.â (Rotten luck for people whose job description is âPredict the future.â) Baldwin offers three-part advice: (1) avoid competing with A.I. and R.I.; (2) build skills in things that only humans can do, in person; and (3) ârealize that humanity is an edge not a handicap.â What all this means is hard to say, especially if youâve never before considered being human to be a handicap. As for the future of humanity, Oppenheimer offers another cockamamie rule of three: âSociety will be divided into three general groups. The first will be members of the elites, who will be able to adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape and who will earn the most money, followed by a second group made up primarily of those who provide personalized services to the elite, including personal trainers, Zumba class instructors, meditation gurus, piano teachers, and personal chefs, and finally a third group of those who will be mostly unemployed and may be receiving a universal basic income as compensation for being the victims of technological unemployment.â\n\nReaders of Douglas Adams will recognize this sort of hooey from â[The Hitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.amazon.com/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345391802/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Hitchhiker%E2%80%99s+Guide+to+the+Galaxy&qid=1551108935&s=books&sr=1-1).â Long ago, in a galaxy not at all far away, the people of the planet Golgafrincham were divided into three groups: A, âall the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achieversâ; B, âhairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultantsâ (the group that everyone else considers to be âa bunch of useless idiotsâ); and, C, âall the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things.â The B people, told they must lead an expedition to colonize another planet, rocket away in a starship, having been led to believe that their planet is doomed. âApparently it was going to crash into the sun or something,â the B shipâs captain tells Arthur Dent, vaguely wondering why the other ships never followed. âOr maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was.â Dent inquires, âAnd they made sure they sent you lot off first, did they?â\n\nThis time, notwithstanding [Elon Musk](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/elon-musk)âs ambition to colonize Mars, no oneâs trying to persuade the B people to board a spaceship, because the B peopleâthe hairdressers and the Zumba-class instructors, the meditation gurus and the personal trainersâare supposed to stick around to cater to the A people. No, this time itâs the C people, the people who make and do thingsâthings that can now be made and done faster and cheaper by robotsâwho are being flushed down the cosmic toilet. The historian and sometime futurist Yuval Noah Harari has a name for the C people: he calls them the âuseless class.â Some futurists suggest that, in our Asimov-y future, these sort of people might wind up spending their empty days playing video games. Otherwise, theyâll wage a revolution, an eventuality that the self-proclaimed âcognitive eliteââthe A people, who believe themselves to be cleverer than the cleverest robotsâintend to wait out in fortified lairs. (Peter Thiel owns nearly five hundred acres of land in New Zealand, complete with its own water supply.) More popular is the proposal to pay the C people for doing nothing, in order to avert the revolution. âItâs going to be necessary,â Musk said during a summit in Dubai two years ago, joining a small herd of other billionaires, including [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Mark%20Zuckerberg), of Facebook, and Stewart Butterfield, of Slack, who endorse universal basic income. Itâs either that or build a wall.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFear of a robot invasion is the obverse of fear of an immigrant invasion, a partisan coin: heads, youâre worried about robots; tails, youâre worried about immigrants. Thereâs just the one coin. Both fears have to do with jobs, whose loss produces suffering, want, and despair, and whose future scarcity represents a terrifying prospect. Misery likes a scapegoat: heads, blame machines; tails, foreigners. But is the present alarm warranted? Panic is not evidence of danger; itâs evidence of panic. Stoking fear of invading robots and of invading immigrants has been going on for a long time, and the predictions of disaster have, generally, been bananas. Oh, but this time itâs different, the robotomizers insist.\n\nThis thesis has been rolling around like a marble in the bowl of a lot of peopleâs brains for a while now, and many of those marbles were handed out by Martin Ford, in his 2015 book, âRise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future.â In the book, and in an essay in â[Confronting Dystopia: The New Technological Revolution and the Future of Work](https://www.amazon.com/Confronting-Dystopia-Technological-Revolution-Future-ebook/dp/B0773XKNK8/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Confronting+Dystopia%3A+The+New+Technological+Revolution+and+the+Future+of+Work&qid=1551108992&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Cornell), Ford acknowledges that all other earlier robot-invasion panics were unfounded. In the nineteenth century, people who worked on farms lost their jobs when agricultural processes were mechanized, but they eventually earned more money working in factories. In the twentieth century, automation of industrial production led to warnings about âunprecedented economic and social disorder.â Instead, displaced factory workers moved into service jobs. Machines eliminate jobs; rising productivity creates new jobs.\n\nâGiven this long record of false alarms, contemporary economists are generally dismissive of arguments that technological progress might lead to unemployment as well as falling wages and soaring income inequality,â Ford admits. After all, âhistory shows that the economy has consistently adjusted to advancing technology by creating new employment opportunities and that these new jobs often require more skills and pay higher wages.â\n\nThat was then. The reason that things will be different this time, Ford argues, has to do with the changing pace of change. The transformation from an agricultural to an industrial economy was linear; the current acceleration is exponential. The first followed Newtonâs law; the second follows Mooreâs. The employment apocalypse, when it comes, will happen so fast that workers wonât have time to adjust by shifting to new employment sectors, and, even if they did have time to adjust, there would be no new employment sectors to go to, because robots will be able to do just about everything.\n\nIt is quite possible that this thesis is correct; it is not possible to know that it is correct. Ford, an advocate of universal basic income, is neither a historian nor an economist. He is a futurist, a modern-day shaman, with an M.B.A. Everybody thinks about the future; futurists do it for a living. Policymakers make plans; futurists read omens. The robots-are-coming omen-reading borrows as much from the conventions of science fiction as from those of historical analysis. It uses ârobotâ as a shorthand for everything from steam-powered looms to electricity-driven industrial assemblers and artificial intelligence, and thus has the twin effects of compressing time and conflating one thing with another. It indulges in the supposition that work is something the wealthy hand out to the poor, from feudalism to capitalism, instead of something people do, for reasons that include a search for order, meaning, and purpose. It leaves out of its accounting the largest source of labor in the United States before the Civil War, people held in bondage, and fails to consider how the rise of wage labor left womenâs work uncompensated. And it ignores the brutal truth that, in American history, panic about technological change is almost always tangled up with panic about immigration. Nineteenth-century populists, those farmers left behind by the industrial revolution, wanted railroad companies to be taxed, but they also wanted to bar African-Americans and Asian immigrants from full citizenship. They raged against the machine; they fought for the color line.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFuturists foretell inevitable outcomes by conjuring up inevitable pasts. People who are in the business of selling predictions need to present the past as predictableâthe ground truth, the test case. Machines are more predictable than people, and in histories written by futurists the machines just keep coming; depicting their march as unstoppable certifies the futuristsâ predictions. But machines donât just keep coming. They are funded, invented, built, sold, bought, and used by people who could just as easily not fund, invent, build, sell, buy, and use them. Machines donât drive history; people do. History is not a smart car.\n\nIn â[Temp: How American Work, American Business, and the American Dream Became Temporary](https://www.amazon.com/Temp-American-Business-Became-Temporary/dp/0735224072/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Temp%3A+How+American+Work%2C+American+Business%2C+and+the+American+Dream+Became+Temporary&qid=1551109012&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Viking), the historian Louis Hyman argues that in the course of the past century management consultants, taking the wheel, reinvented work by making employers more like machines, turning work into the kind of thing that robots could do long before there were any robots able to do it. His story begins in the nineteen-twenties, with the rise of management consulting, and takes a turn in the fifties, with the first major wave of automation, a word coined in 1948\\. âMachines should be used instead of people whenever possible,â a staffer for the National Office Managers Association advised in 1952\\. To compete, workers had to become as flexible as machines: able to work on a task basis; ineligible for unions; free at night; willing to work any shift; requiring no health care or other benefits, not so much as a day off at Christmas; easy to hire; and easier to fire.\n\nâThe rise of computers and the rise of temps went hand in hand,â Hyman writes. By 1958, Elmer Winter had founded Manpower, Inc., and companies all over the country had come to rely on the services of management consultants to trim their employment costs. Hyman argues, âBeginning in the midst of the postwar boom in the 1950s, American jobs were slowly remade from top to bottom: consultants supplanted executives at the top, temps replaced office workers in the middle, and day laborers pushed out union workers at the bottom. On every step of the ladder, work would become more insecure as it became more flexible.â\n\nGradually, Hyman says, âthe key features of the postwar corporationâstable workforce, retained earnings, and minimized riskâbecame liabilities rather than assets.â Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, Harvard Business Schoolâs Michael Porter introduced the logic underlying outsourcing. By the nineteen-eighties, corporations had to get âlean.â (I worked for Porter in those days, as a Manpower temp.) By the nineteen-nineties, they needed to âdownsize.â If businesses exist not to make things and employ people but instead to maximize profits for investors, labor can be done by temps, by poorly paid workers in other countries, or by robots, whichever is cheapest.\n\nThe robots, though, were mainly for show. In the nineteen-eighties, Apple called its headquarters the Robot Factory. âTo understand the electronics industry is simple: every time someone says ârobot,â simply picture a woman of color,â Hyman advises. One in five electronics companies used no automation at all, and the rest used very little. Seagateâs disk drives were assembled by women in Singapore. Hewlett-Packard hired so many temporary workers that it started its own temp agency. The most important technology in the electronics industry, as Hyman points out, was the fingernail.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c6f02d1cc63602cef2e4152]||||||\n+++\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties, the sociologist Patricia Fernandez-Kelly conducted a study of the electronics and garment industries in Southern California. More than seventy per cent of the labor force was women of color, and more than seventy per cent of those women were Hispanic. In San Diego, Fernandez-Kelly interviewed a woman she called Fermina Calero (a pseudonym, to protect her from deportation). Calero was born in Mexico. In 1980, when she was twenty-one, she began working in Tijuana, soldering filaments of metal for sixty-five cents an hour. In 1983, Calero crossed into the United States, illegally, to work at Kaypro, the maker of the Kaypro II, a personal computer that briefly rivalled the Apple II. In the nineteen-sixties and seventies, Andrew Kay, the companyâs founder, had hired management consultants to help him reimagine his labor force. In the eighties, when people speaking English responded to the companyâs newspaper Help Wanted ads, they were told that there were no openings; when people speaking Spanish called, they were invited to apply. By the time Calero started working for Kaypro, its workforce consisted of seven hundred people, nearly all undocumented Mexican immigrants. The companyâs general manager said, âThey are reliable; they work hard; they donât make trouble.â At Kaypro, Calero earned nearly five dollars an hour. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service raided the factory, she hid in a supply closet. She was not a robot.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn 1984, the year that Calero hid in a closet at Kaypro, computer scientists at the annual meeting of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence began warning about the coming of an âA.I. winterâ: artificial intelligence had been overhyped by a credulous press and overfunded by incautious investors, and, given these wild and wide-eyed expectations, it had underdelivered. The hype was about to die down, and the funding to dry up. The A.I. winter lasted for years.\n\nSkeptics of the current robots-are-coming argument predict the arrival of another A.I. winter. âWe have not moved a byte forward in understanding human intelligence,â Zia Chishti wrote in the _Financial Times_ last fall. âWe have much faster computers, thanks to Mooreâs law, but the underlying algorithms are mostly identical to those that powered machines 40 years ago.â That goes back to the time of the Kaypro.\n\nA lot has changed in those forty years, not least in the availability of enormous sets of data that artificial intelligences can use to study and learn. Still, the economist RobertÂ J. Gordon is unconvinced that the robots are coming. In his 2016 book, â[The Rise and Fall of American Growth](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691175802/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Rise+and+Fall+of+American+Growth&qid=1551109043&s=books&sr=1-1),â he argued that a century of economic expansion that began in 1870âdriven by human-condition changing developments like electricity, a public water supply, and the interstate-highway systemâended in 1970, and that, since then, inventions have been merely incremental. The telephone was patented in 1876\\. It changed peopleâs lives, and contributed to a huge rise in productivity. The cell phone, Gordon argues, just isnât that different from a telephone. In a 2016 essay, â[Why Robots Will Not Decimate Human Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-robots-decimate-human-jobs-bob-gordon),â Gordon points out that the uses to which smartphones get put are ânot a part of the market economy that creates jobs and pays wages.â Robots have altered manufacturing, he concedes, but he doesnât think that theyâve altered the economy, or that theyâre about to. âI play a game called âfind the robot,âÂ â he writes. âIn my daily strolls in and out of supermarkets, restaurants, doctor and dentist offices, my nearby hospital, offices in my own university, and the vast amount of employment involving elementary and secondary teachers, personal trainers, and old age caretakers, I have yet to find a robot.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nStill, even if the hype about robots is mostly unwarranted, the worry about jobs is real. If the latest jobs numbers look good, the longer-term trends look bad, especially for Americans without a high-school diploma, or less, a population whose real wages have been falling for decades. In a downward compression of the labor market, these jobs have been taken not so much by robots as by college graduates: as much as forty per cent of college graduates are currently working at jobs that do not require a college degree, Ellen Ruppel Shell reports, in â[The Job: Work and Its Future in a Time of Radical Change](https://www.amazon.com/Job-Work-Future-Radical-Change/dp/0451497252/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Job%3A+Work+and+Its+Future+in+a+Time+of+Radical+Change&qid=1551109109&s=books&sr=1-1-catcorr)â (Currency). Four out of every five children born in the United States in 1950 went on to earn more than their parents. For children born in 1980, that ratio had fallen to one in two. Lately, itâs down to one in three. Estimates range from the cautious to the entirely hysterical, but one reasonable study predicts that, by 2050, one in four working-age American men will be unemployed, having been replaced by some form of automation. Most imminently threatened are the millions of people who work as drivers of cars and trucks, scheduled to be replaced by fleets of self-driving vehicles beginning as early as next year.\n\nEconomic inequality produces political instability and partisan death matches. Everyone worries about jobs, but people who worry about robots and people who worry about immigrants propose very different solutions. Either way, much writing in this field is, essentially, fantasy. In âThe Globotics Upheaval,â Baldwin predicts that the march of the robots will have four stages: transformation, upheaval, backlash, and resolution. The resolution will involve what he calls âshelterism.â Once white-collar workers realize that their jobs are on the line, too, theyâll find ways to protect themselves by âshelteringâ certain activities, things that only humans can do. He explains, âThis will mean that our work lives will be filled with far more caring, sharing, understanding, creating, empathizing, innovating, and managing people who are actually in the same room. This is a logical inevitabilityâeverything else will be done by globots.â The catch is that, historically, caring, sharing, understanding, and empathizing with people who are in the same room as you has been the work of women, and is therefore either unpaid, and not recognized as work, or paid very badly. Childcare, elementary-school teaching, nursing, geriatric care, and social work will not suddenly become high-paying, high-prestige professions simply because everything else is done by robots. If that were going to happen, it would already be happening, because we already know that these jobs require beings who are human. Instead, something darker is going on, mirrored in the feminizing of robots, from the male robots of the nineteen-sixties and seventiesâHal, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Mr. Robinsonâs robot on âLost in Spaceââto the fembots and sexbots of âHerâ and âEx Machina,â and, not least, the sexy and slavish Alexa. Female workers arenât being paid more for being human; instead, robots are selling better when theyâre female.\n\nThe economist Oren Cass, the author of â[The Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America](https://www.amazon.com/Once-Future-Worker-Renewal-America/dp/1641770147/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Once+and+Future+Worker%3A+A+Vision+for+the+Renewal+of+Work+in+America&qid=1551109128&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Encounter), much of which originally appeared in _National Review_, is fed up with the robot hysteria. âTechnological innovation and automation have always been integral to our economic progress, and in a well-functioning labor market, they should produce gains for all types of workers,â he insists. He has no patience with advocates of universal basic income, either. âWe have reached a point where the rich think paying everyone else to go away represents compassionate thinking,â he writes.\n\nLike Hyman, Cass blames mid-twentieth-century economic thinkers for the current malaise, though he blames different thinkers. In the middle decades of the twentieth century, he argues, economic policymakers abandoned workers and the health of the labor market in favor of a commitment to over-all economic growth, with redistribution as an adjustment and consumerism as its objective. That required quantifying prosperity, hence the G.D.P., a measure that Cass, along with other writers, finds to be disastrous, not least because it values consumers above producers. Cass sees universal basic income as the end-stage scenario of every other redistribution program, whose justification is that the poor will be fine without work as long as they can buy things. Here he mocks the advocates of the current economic arrangement, who are prone to note that the poor are not actually starving, âand so many people have iPhones!â\n\nReporters are suckers for the hype, Cass maintains, pointing out that after a 2017 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that, in the next hundred years, robots might eliminate as many manufacturing jobs as were lost in 2001 (presumably, a tolerable loss), the _Times_ ran a story with the headline â*Evidence That Robots Are Winning the Race for American Jobs*{: .small},â while the Washington _Post_ titled its story â*Weâre So Unprepared for the Robot Apocalypse*{: .small}.â Cass offers a careful criticism of the robots-are-stealing-our-jobs theory. He cites four of its errors. It overestimates twenty-first-century innovations and underestimates the innovations of earlier centuries. It miscalculates the pace of change. It assumes that automation will not create new sectors. (3-D printing might replace a lot of manufacturing workers, but it could also create a lot of new small businesses.) And it fails to appreciate the complexity of many of the jobs it thinks robots can do. The 2013 Oxford study that kept AndrÃ©s Oppenheimer up at night Cass finds to be mostly silly. Its authors, Carl Frey and Michael Osborne, rated seven hundred and two occupations from least âcomputerizableâ to most. Highly vulnerable are school-bus drivers, and, while a self-driving school bus does not seem technically too far off, Cass points out, few parents can imagine putting their kids on a bus without a grownup to make sure they donât bash one another the whole way to school.\n\nCassâs own policy proposals center, very reasonably, on the importance of work and family, but he fails to demonstrate how his proposalsâlowering environmental regulations and establishing academic tracking in high schoolsâwill achieve his objectives. And though âThe Once and Future Workerâ offers a rousing call for an honest reckoning with American economic policy, it also indulges in its own sleight of hand. âThe story goes that âautomationâ or the âknowledge economy,â not bad public policy, is to blame,â Cass writes. âHistorically, economists and policy makers have led the effort to explain that technological innovation is good for workers throughout the economy, even as its âcreative destructionâ causes dislocation for some. So why, suddenly, are they so eager to throw robots and programmers under the bus?â One answer might be that, given the current state of American political polarization, itâs either throw the robots under the bus or throw the immigrants. Cass, not surprisingly, advocates restricting immigration.\n\n-=-=-=\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) ran for President on a promise to create twenty-five million new jobs during the next decade. âMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before,â he said in September, 2016\\. Many economists mocked his plan, which included protecting American jobs by imposing tariffs on imports. _The Economist_ [announced](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/07/30/drawbridges-up) a new political fault line, not between left and right but between open and closed: âWelcome immigrants or keep them out? Open up to foreign trade or protect domestic industries? Embrace cultural change, or resist it?â [Barack Obama](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Barack%20Obama) was an opener. Openers tend to talk about robots. âThe next wave of economic dislocation wonât come from overseas,â Obama said in his farewell address, in January, 2017, days before Trumpâs Inauguration. âIt will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good, middle-class jobs obsolete.â\n\nTrump is a closer. Closers tend to talk about immigrants. Trump has tweeted the word âjobsâ nearly six hundred times, but not once has he tweeted the words ârobot,â ârobots,â or âautomation.â âWeâre going to fight for every last American job,â he promised from the floor of a Boeing plant in South Carolina, weeks after taking office. âI donât want companies leaving our country,â the new President said. âThere will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the products, and think that they are going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border.â That June, Boeing laid off nearly two hundred employees from the South Carolina plant, as part of a forty-per-cent reduction in its production of 777s. In 2017, the company laid off nearly six thousand workers.\n\nTrumpâs Administration mocks fears of a robot invasion. Closers usually do. âIâm not worried at all,â Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said two years ago. Nevertheless, some think tankers suggested that Trumpâs election was âsecretly about automation.â And [a study](https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-abstract/34/3/418/5047377) published last summer in the _Oxford Review of Economic Policy_âwhose lead author, Carl Frey, is the same guy who made the list of the seven hundred and two most computerizable jobsâargues that the robot caravan got Trump elected. Measuring the density of robots and comparing them with election returns, Frey and his colleagues found that âelectoral districts that became more exposed to automation during the years running up to the election were more likely to vote for Trump.â Indulging in a counterfactual, they suggest that a less steeply rising increase in exposure to robots would have tipped both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin toward voting for [Hillary Clinton](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/hillary-clinton). According to this line of thinking, Twitter bots and fake Facebook news didnât elect Donald Trump, but robots really might have. Or maybe it was all the talk about the wall.\n\nHeads, the robots are coming! Accept the inevitability of near-universal unemployment! Tails, the Mexicans are coming! Close the borders! So far, the only other choice, aside from helplessly watching the rise of extremism, is to mint a new coin. Heat a forge. Smelt a blank. Engrave two dies. Put your blank in between them.

Among the principal victims, in their experience, are young, first-time mothers, who are sometimes so intimidated that theyâre unable to eat. Isolating their tormentors in a separate group isnât a solution, Hunt told me: âThey just knock the crap out of each other.â\n\nThe bullies and victims we were discussing are cows. Lawlor milks about three hundred Holsteins on a farm in County Meath, Ireland, an hour northwest of Dublin. The farm has been in his family for four generations; his calf barn, which is long and narrow and made of primeval-looking gray stone, was a horse stable in his grandfatherâs time. He, Hunt, and I were standing in a more recent structure a few feet away, a hangar-size cowshed with a corrugated-metal roof. Directly in front of us, a cow that weighed maybe seventeen hundred pounds was using her anvil-shaped head to push a smaller cow away from a pile of bright-green grass, which had been cut that morning and heaped on the floor. For Lawlor, this was an act with economic consequences. A mature lactating Holstein will eat well over a hundred pounds of grass and other feed in a day, and produce about nine gallons of milk. Immature cows yield less to begin with, and their output falls further if they have trouble reaching their food.\n\nIt was partly in the hope of resolving this issue that Lawlor had engaged Huntâs company, Cainthus, an artificial-intelligence startup based in Dublin. Hunt, the companyâs president, describes its specialty as âfacial recognition for cowsâ; it uses surveillance cameras, computer vision, and predictive imaging to track animals and analyze their behavior. Not long before my visit, a crew had installed cameras on slender aluminum beams several feet above Lawlorâs feed areas and water troughs. (The installers had learned from experience to mount the cameras higher than cows can reach with their tongues.) Price competition has put pressure on farmers in many countries to enlarge their herds and increase their output, even as their children are deciding theyâd rather work for Google. Lawlorâs next big farm-equipment purchase, he said, is likely to be a robot.\n\nCainthusâs chief financial officer is David Huntâs fraternal twin, Ross. Theyâre thirty-six years old. They grew up in a tiny farming community in Connemara, near the countryâs west coast, and for a long time they were the only people they knew whose family owned a personal computer. After college, they held jobs in business and finance. When they were in their late twenties, they went to work for their fatherâs grain company (first Ross, then David) and, with their fatherâs encouragement, quickly took it over. They replaced its ancient trading software with a cloud-based system that they designed, and they proved that speculating in grain futures, which the companyâs traders had always believed to be a source of profit, was a consistent money loser. In two and a half years, the companyâs annual revenue roughly doubled. Then they got bored and left (first David, then Ross). They attended a Silicon Valley incubator started by Peter Diamandis and Ray Kurzweil, and founded Cainthus in 2016, with a third partner, Robin Johnston, who had grown up around dairy farms in Canada and later helped to develop computer-vision systems. The companyâs name comes from the word for the corner of an eye, âcanthusâ; the added âiâ creates a mild internal pun on the abbreviation of âartificial intelligence.â Ross said, âIf you want to Google well, invent your name.â\n\nâAgriculture is the least digitized industry in the world right now,â David told me. He and his brother believe that artificial intelligence can reduce the environmental impact of food production, by making it more efficient, and can also make it more humane. Cainthusâs first outside investor was Aidan Connolly, the director of innovation at Alltech, an American agricultural-technology company, who told me that he believes Cainthus âwill change the world.â One way it will do that, he said, is by enabling farmers with large herds to know as much about the behavior of individual cows as farmers with small herds do. In January, the global food conglomerate Cargill became a significant minority shareholder in Cainthus, and also a development partner. During the week I was in Ireland, Cainthus was installing five dairy-farm systems in addition to Lawlorâs: three in Canada and two in Italy.\n\nThe Huntsâ long-term ambitions donât necessarily end at agriculture. âAnytime I talk about doing something with bovines, Iâm painfully aware of how transferrable that is,â David said. Working with animals gives Cainthus a research advantage over facial-recognition companies focussing on people, he said, because cows donât hide behind hats, sunglasses, or clothes, and they donât object if you spy on them, and you can interfere at will with their behavior. (âDonât mess with the mammal whose fight-or-flight response involves lawyers,â he said.) âA number of years from now, we will have a difficult decision to make,â he continued. âAll the core competencies weâve built up on cowsâat what point do we transition them to humans?â The companyâs goals involve not merely identifying individuals but closely analyzing their behavior. Potential applications, in his view, include helping professional athletes train more effectively and diagnosing illnesses before their sufferers notice symptoms, but itâs easy to imagine less benign uses. âIf you put it in the wrong hands, facial-recognition technology is a dangerous tool,â he said. âIf you donât feel incredibly threatened the first time you hear about it, you donât understand what it is.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOne afternoon twenty years ago, I was walking on the Upper East Side and barely paying attention to where I was going. Suddenly, I realized that a person whoâd just passed me on the sidewalk had seemed kind of familiar. I stopped, thought for a moment, and hollered, âWilson!â He turned around. It was a guy Iâd gone to high school with. Heâd never been one of my close friends, I hadnât seen him in more than twenty years, heâd lost most of his hair and grown a beard, I had no reason to think heâd be in New York, and Iâd only glimpsed him as he walked past. Yet somehow Iâd known who he was.\n\nPutting names to faces, like formulating conspiracy theories, relies on pattern recognition. Some people are remarkably bad at it, and have trouble recognizing their spouses, their children, and even themselves in photographs. And some people are remarkably good at it. When, in September, Scotland Yard [charged two suspects](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/world/europe/salisbury-novichok-poisoning.html) in the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, its investigative team included so-called âsuper recognizers,â who have a preternatural talent for noticing and remembering facial features and other distinguishing characteristics. Most people fall between those extremes: weâre occasional Wilson-spotters who nevertheless donât believe our wives when they tell us that the actor who played the con artist in â[American Hustle](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/grand-scam)â is the same actor who played the F.B.I. agent in â[Public Enemies](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/07/06/tommy-guns-and-toys).â\n\nIn the late sixties and early seventies, computer scientists began trying to use a digital form of pattern recognition to identify faces in photographs. The first challenge was programming a computer simply to determine whether a given image contained a face. Harder still, years later, was identifying people in images that werenât composed like mug shots; in one technique, scientists had to create digital three-dimensional models of the human head so that they could ânormalizeâ photographs that hadnât been taken face on. A major advance occurred two decades ago, with the introduction of the first graphics-processing units (G.P.U.s) for desktop computers. The original market was gamers, but the devices were so fast at handling certain kinds of repetitive calculations that artificial-intelligence researchers rapidly made use of them as well.\n\nAlmost all current facial-recognition systems employ what are known as artificial neural networks. They arenât programmed, in the old-fashioned sense. If youâre using one to recognize faces, you donât write lines of code related to things like hair color and nose length; instead, you âtrainâ the neural network, by repeatedly giving it large numbers of labelled examples and counterexamplesââcowâ; ânot cowââwhich it compares, beginning at the pixel level. This process is guided by humans, who tweak various parameters when the neural networks make mistakes, but to an unnerving degree the algorithms, not their creators, determine which similarities and differences are significant and which are not. For that reason, neural networks are sometimes referred to as âblack boxes.â\n\nRecently, I visited the Computer Vision Lab at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. I found a parking space across from the Computer Science Department, but before I could leave my car I had to download an app and enroll in something called ParkMobile. I made so many mistakes while entering my credit-card number that I kept wishing Google would simply check my face through the windshield and withdraw the stupid three dollars and sixty-three cents from my checking account. Finally, I sorted things out, and found the office of Erik Learned-Miller, one of the labâs two directors. Heâs in his early fifties, and has worked on computer vision for two decades; he has so much faith in humanity that he shares his passwords with students and doesnât lock his bicycle or his car. We sat in the buildingâs lounge, and he told me that several transformative developments in his field had occurred during the past dozen years. One was the sudden availability of enormous databases of useful images. He said, âSuppose itâs the nineteen-eighties and somebody comes to you from the future and says, âHereâs a neural-network design that will work great for face recognition. You just need a million pairs of faces, for training.â And you would say, âThatâs great, but I canât get a million pairs of faces.â Well, today you can just scrape them off the Internet.â\n\nAnother breakthrough was the creation of an economical method of appending the correct identity to each image in a large database. This was made possible, he said, by services like [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/video-turking-for-respect), through which people known as Turkers sign up to perform tiny, repetitive tasks that humans still do better than computers, for as little as a penny a task. (Cainthus uses a somewhat more upscale service: a dedicated team of cow identifiers at CloudFactory, an outsourcing company in Nepal.) Learned-Miller took advantage of these new capabilities in 2007, when he and several collaborators created a database that they called Labeled Faces in the Wild; it became a benchmarking tool for facial-recognition researchers all over the world, including those at [Facebook](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy), [Google](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge), and the Chinese conglomerate Tencent. An even bigger breakthrough, he said, involved roughly simultaneous improvements in G.P.U.s, computers, and neural networks. All these elements came together in 2012, and later made possible such innovations as [Appleâs Face ID](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/the-nightmare-faces-of-apple-engineering-and-cindy-shermans-instagram), [Teslaâs Autopilot](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/will-the-tesla-model-3-be-the-first-truly-self-driving-car), and so-called â[deep learning](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-deep-learning-a-revolution-in-artificial-intelligence).â\n\nA few days after my trip to UMass, I visited I.B.M.âs ThomasÂ J. Watson Research Center, in Yorktown Heights, New York. JohnÂ R. Smith, the centerâs manager of artificial-intelligence technology, told me that, in 2016, heâd been part of a team at I.B.M. that helped to create a [computer-vision system](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md) for detecting malignant melanoma, a potentially lethal form of skin cancer. Dermatologists usually look for symptoms described by an alphabetical mnemonic: Asymmetrical shape, uneven Border, variety of Color, largish Diameter, and Evolution over time. I.B.M. ignored all that, Smith said, and instead created a database of labelled images of malignant and nonmalignant lesions, then gave that database to deep-learning researchers, who used it to train melanoma-recognition algorithms. âThe reason we do it that way is that we get better performance when we donât inject suboptimal human features,â he said. When the algorithms were tested against the diagnoses of expert dermatologists, the algorithms consistently made fewer mistakes.\n\nSmith also showed me video compilations created by one of I.B.M.âs âmultimodalâ recognition systems, which is able to automatically generate highlight reels from raw sports footage by analyzing things like crowd cheers, announcer excitement, fist pumps, high fives, and the location of the three-point-shot line. The companyâs researchers used a version of the system on tennis matches at the 2017 U.S. Open; it worked flawlessly, Smith said, except with one player, who appeared to the computer to be pumping her fist when she was actually just wiping her face with a towel. âSo we had to go in and retrain the system,â he said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nCainthusâs headquarters is a rented workspace at Dogpatch Labs, a âcurated startup hubâ in a former tobacco, tea, and spirits warehouse on Dublinâs Custom House Quay. The building is situated near the western end of the cityâs Silicon Docks area, which extends for more than a mile along both banks of the River Liffey and houses the European offices of many technology companies. Cainthus occupies a cheerful glass-and-exposed-brick box on the ground floor. When I visited, the office contained two dozen white desks (Rossâs sitting, Davidâs standing), as well as computers, freshly unboxed Dell PowerEdge rack servers, piles of tangled cables, and a small round bed for Rossâs dog. I sat at Rossâs desk and put on a pair of virtual-reality goggles. With them on, I could explore a cowshed like the one Iâd visited at Stephen Lawlorâs farm. These goggles were just for demonstrationsâthe cows I was looking at were recordedâbut a future version will show real-time imagery overlaid with data linked to individual animals, enabling farmers to minutely monitor the health, eating and drinking habits, and inter-cow behavior of their herds, all without having to interfere with their lives.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c0aca356fe65d7e16f1b3fa]||||||\n+++\n\nStanding at a desk at the far end of the room was Jane Cummings, who is Cainthusâs head of product science. She grew up in Brooklyn, earned a Ph.D. in high-energy physics from Yale, and spent five years smashing subatomic particles at *CERN*{: .small}âs Large Hadron Collider, in Switzerland. She is now a student of cow behavior. She and her team were about to meet with Martin Kavanagh, a former large-animal veterinarian, who grew up on a small farm in County Tipperary and now works as a consultant. (His firm is Cow Solutions.) Kavanagh told me, âCows are slow-moving prey animals, and as a result they are incredibly stoicâbecause if they show pain theyâre going to be killed first.â Cows regard humans as threatsâwith good reasonâand they are adept at concealing injuries and illnesses. âBy the time we see cows in pain as we perceive it, they may have endured a lot already,â Kavanagh continued. âSo, if we have a system that looks at them when they arenât afraid, we may see the pain sooner.â David Hunt said, âOne of the joys of facial recognition is that we can see cowsâ natural behavior, instead of âUh-oh, girls, calm down, donât make eye contact with the predator.âÂ â Once the companyâs algorithms have been fully trained, a farmer wonât have to be present even to know that a cow is about to calveâsomething that happens on Lawlorâs farm an average of once a day.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn 2016, Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, gave a *TED*{: .small}x talk in Boston. Buolamwini is black. In her presentation, she played a video showing that a common facial-recognition algorithm didnât even recognize her face as a faceâuntil she covered it with a featureless white plastic mask. (The same thing happened to her in college, when she had to âborrowâ a white roommate to complete an artificial-intelligence assignment.) Computer-vision algorithms, she explained, inevitably recapitulate the conscious and unconscious biases of the people who create and train them, a defect that she calls the âcoded gaze.â I spoke with her recently. âThereâs an assumption of machine neutrality,â she said. âAnd thereâs actually a hope that the technology we create will be less biased than we are. But we donât equip these systems to overcome our prejudices.â Gender Shades, a project she directed at M.I.T., showed that dark-skinned females are far more likely than light-skinned males to be misidentified by commercial facial-analysis systems. She has founded the Algorithmic Justice League, which employs multiple approaches to identifying and eliminating biases in artificial intelligence, and, with a grant from the Ford Foundation, she created âA.I., Ainât I a Woman?,â a poetic multimedia presentation.\n\nIn 2012, the New York Police Department implemented what it calls the Domain Awareness System, which it developed in partnership with Microsoft (and from which it earns a royalty when other cities adopt it). The system uses thousands of public-facing surveillance cameras, including many owned by private businesses. One afternoon in September, I sat on a bench in front of One Police Plaza, the N.Y.P.D.âs headquarters, with Clare Garvie, who is a senior associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology, at Georgetown Law School, in Washington. From where we were sitting, I could see two cops in a brick security booth. Like most bored people nowadays, they were staring at their phones, but their inattention didnât matter, because the plaza was being watched by a dozen or so building-mounted cameras, most of which looked like larger versions of the ones that Cainthus uses on cows: dark domes that resembled light fixtures. I asked Garvie what the police were doing with whatever the cameras were recording, and she said there was no way to know.\n\nâThe N.Y.P.D. has resisted our efforts to get any information about their technology,â she said. It was only after the center sued the department that it began to receive documents that it had initially requested more than two years earlier. By contrast, San Diego publishes reports on the facial-recognition system used by its police and holds public meetings about it. Last year, the Seattle City Council passed a comprehensive ordinance requiring disclosure of the cityâs surveillance technologies; this year, it voted to physically dismantle a network of video cameras and cell-phone trackers, installed in 2013, that was like a smaller version of the Domain Awareness System. But most big cities donât reveal much about what theyâre up to, and no federal law requires them to do so. Chicago and Los Angeles are as secretive as New York, and have put off attempts by Garvieâs group, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other organizations to learn more.\n\nGarvie is thirty-one. She majored in political science and human rights at Barnard, earned a law degree at Georgetown, and stayed on, after graduation, as a law fellow. In 2016, she was the lead author of âThe Perpetual Line-âUp: Unregulated Police Face Recognition in America,â a [study](https://www.perpetuallineup.org/) whose title refers to the fact that many states allow police departments to search their databases of mug shots and driverâs-license photos. Garvie doesnât doubt that facial recognition has legitimate uses in law enforcement, just as wiretaps and personal searches do. But misuse is inevitable. âRight now, quite literally, thereâs no such thing as face-recognition abuse, in one sense, because there are really no laws governing its use by police,â she said. If your face appears in an accessible database, as it probably does, youâre effectively a suspect every time itâs searched. And you donât have to be a cop to have access to the millions of photos on social-media sitesâmany of which are labelled automatically. (This is less of a threat to happen in Canada and Europe, where comprehensive privacy laws have prevented social-media sites from even offering automated photo-tagging.) Garvie and her colleagues have written a fourteen-page model bill intended to regulate the use of facial-recognition technology in law enforcement. Among many other things, it would require the custodians of arrest-photo databases to regularly purge images of people who are not later convicted of whatever act it was that prompted their arrest. Their first version of the bill was published in 2016; no legislature has adopted it.\n\nPeople who have grown up with smartphones and social media may think that the very concept of personal privacy has become quaintly irrelevant, but there are reasons for even habitual oversharers to be alarmed. Faces, unlike fingerprints or iris patterns, can easily be recorded without the knowledge of the people they belong to, and that means that facial recognition can be used for remote surveillance. âWe would be horrified if law-enforcement agents were to walk through a protest demanding that everybody show their identification,â Garvie said. âYet thatâs what face recognition enables.â Computer-vision systems potentially allow cops and employers to track behaviors and activities that are none of their business, such as where you hang out after work, which fund-raisers you attend, and what that slight tremor in your hand (recorded by the camera in the elevator that you ride to your office every morning) portends about the size of your future medical claims. In October, [Tim Cook](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/tim-cook), the C.E.O. of Apple, while speaking at a privacy conference in Brussels, said, âOur own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency.â\n\nIn May, forty-one nonprofit organizations, including the A.C.L.U. and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, sent an open letter to [Jeff Bezos](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-bezos), Amazonâs C.E.O., requesting that the company stop selling its facial-recognition system, called Rekognition, to governments and government agencies. Two months after the letter was sent, the A.C.L.U. conducted a test, in which Rekognition erroneously matched twenty-eight members of Congress with individuals in a database of twenty-five thousand publicly available mug shots. The matches included a disproportionate number of members of the Congressional Black Caucusâa clear example of the coded gaze. Amazon objected that the A.C.L.U. had set its âconfidence thresholds,â which represent the probability that a given match is correct, at a level lower than the company recommends for law-enforcement searches. But, even so, there is no law that prevents police departments from doing the same thing. A recent investigation by the British civil-liberties group Big Brother Watch found that the automated facial-recognition system used by the Metropolitan Police Service, in Greater London, had a false-positive rate of ninety-eight per cent, and that the police retained images of thousands of innocent citizens, for future searches.\n\nA man who helped to develop the N.Y.P.D.âs facial-recognition system has said that when he was with the police department he enhanced surveillance photos by, for example, using Photoshop to replace suspectsâ closed eyes with other peopleâs open eyes, creating what he once called âa second opportunity to return a match.â Garvie told me, âEyes are incredibly important to a face identification, and here they were using someone elseâs. Itâs like taking half of a latent fingerprint and drawing in the rest.â\n\nBoth Garvie and Buolamwini believe that some uses, such as the incorporation of real-time facial identification into police body cameras, should be banned entirely. Body cams have generally been viewed as a valuable check on violence by copsâand as a backup for cops whoâve been wrongly accusedâbut the dangers are huge, they said. Garvie told me, âIn most face-recognition systems that exist today, there is a human analyst somewhere who is given time to look at the photos and determine whether they represent a similar individual. But with body cams the technology itself becomes the final arbiter. An alert goes into a headset or a mobile device, and an officer with a gun has a moment to decide whether or not there is a threat to public safety.â Last year, Axonâthe leading manufacturer of body cams, formerly known as Taser Internationalâbought Dextro and Misfit, two startups in computer vision and artificial intelligence. In April, the Algorithmic Justice League and the Center on Privacy and Technology were among the signers of an open letter to Axonâs artificial-intelligence ethics board, urging, among other things, that the company not include real-time facial recognition in its body cams. Buolamwini told me, âDecisions to end lives are too precarious to be left to artificial intelligence. And, given what we know about the current state of the technology, itâs absolutely irresponsible.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nUsing computer vision to identify an individual cow in a farmerâs herd is much easier and more reliable than using it to identify an unknown human in a surveillance photograph. One reason is that, in the case of the cow, the farmer knows for certain that a perfect match exists in the farmâs database. There is also more than one way to visually identify a cow. Cainthus identifies animals by distinctive markings, tufts, and swirls in the pelt on their faces and bodies, and itâs able to confirm its matches whenever its cameras pick up the numbered identification tag thatâs attached to every animalâs ear. (Humans have distinctive pelts, too, sort of, but we largely conceal them under clothes.) No single element is visible at all times, but each one helps to confirm the others, enabling the system to double-check its identifications and to track animals even when their faces and bodies are partially obscured. Cainthus hopes someday to identify animals also by their gait, a trait thatâs as individual as a face.\n\nChina has nearly two hundred million public-surveillance cameras, far more than any other country. In 2015, it announced plans to build an integrated human-monitoring system, with the goal, according to the [Washington _Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2018/01/07/feature/in-china-facial-recognition-is-sharp-end-of-a-drive-for-total-surveillance/?utm_term=.d71c6c2e973a), of making the cameras âomnipresent, fully networked, always working and fully controllableâ by 2020\\. The reliable real-time identification of more than a billion people by their faces alone is not possible yet, but the Chinese system doesnât depend on faces alone. Erik Learned-Miller, of UMass, told me, âLetâs assume youâre a Chinese citizen and your home address is registered with the government. So when they see a person in Xiâan who looks like you, and they know you live in Xiâan, theyâll probably guess itâs you. And if theyâre also tracking your cell phone and they know that twenty minutes ago you were in a restaurant nearbyânow itâs almost certainly you.â Cell-phone signals and digital financial transactions, which in China are highly centralized, are the human-surveillance equivalent of bovine ear tags: theyâre supplemental identifiers that increase the reliability of facial matches. âThe Chinese are integrating massively,â Learned-Miller continued. âThey can say, âHey, we recognized this guy in a Starbucks this morning, and now heâs in a McDonaldâsâhe is getting too American, letâs bring him in.âÂ â\n\nBy the time Chinaâs surveillance system is fully implemented, it will include mandatory âsocial creditâ ratings, which score individualsâ general worthiness based on factors such as what they buy (too much alcohol?), what they do with their free time (too many video games?), and whom they hang out with online (too many low-rated social parasites?). A voluntary version of the rating system is already in place. People with high scores are given opportunities that others donât receive, including access to jobs, loans, and travel. And virtual ear tags are proliferating. The N.Y.P.D. reads and records the license plates of many vehicles that enter and leave the city. Google knows everywhere Iâve been with my phone. China has begun employing its own gait-recognition technology, which its developer has said canât be fooled by âlimping, walking with splayed feet, or hunching over.â\n\nAmericans may believe that we would never tolerate the installation of millions of surveillance cameras, but the Hunts told me that we wouldnât necessarily know it was happening. Ross Hunt said, âI want autonomous driving to be a thing, but if you have autonomous-car ubiquity you have the Internet of Eyes everywhere, because on an autonomous car there are cameras all the way around.â Self-driving vehicles use their cameras to identify and avoid obstacles, but any camera that sees its surroundings also sees every person it passes. Many electric vehicles record location and driving data continuously and periodically upload that information to their manufacturers; China now requires all such vehicles operating in the country to transmit the same information to government monitors. Ross went on, âThatâs today. So, if they already have your telemetry, how long will it be until they also have the imagery? Itâs just a bandwidth issue.â\n\nFacial-recognition technology is advancing faster than the people who worry about it have been able to think of ways to manage it. Indeed, in any number of fields the gap between what scientists are up to and what nonscientists understand about it is almost certainly greater now than it has been at any time since the [Manhattan Project](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/manhattan-project). Learned-Miller told me that he now frequently confers with Buolamwini, whom he met at a conference, and that because of her he has become more involved in issues of transparency and fairness. But heâs still advancing the state of the art. A few weeks before my visit, he received a big grant from the Department of Defenseâhistorically one of the biggest funders of facial-recognition researchâfor a project involving âvisual common sense,â which has to do with teaching computers to be more humanlike in their problem-solving.\n\nHe had also just presented a paper at the European Conference on Computer Vision, in Munich, about a simple method that he and several other scientists, including three of his students, had devised, by which neural networks can catch and correct their own errors. On the monitor on his desk, he showed me a PowerPoint slide that included three consecutive frames from the movie â[Hannah and Her Sisters](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/17/west-side-story-3).â In each frame, an automatic face-detection tool had correctly drawn a box around the face of Barbara Hershey. But in the middle frame it had incorrectly also drawn a box around the right hand of Maureen OâSullivan, who was talking to Hershey with her back to the camera. (Learned-Miller said that, when a computer misidentifies something as a face, surprisingly often the thing that fools it is a hand.) The paper explained that a detection algorithm can eliminate such errors by comparing consecutive video frames and rejecting putative faces that appear suddenly, as if from nowhere, and immediately disappear. The rejected faces then become training counterexamples, and increase the detectorâs ability to avoid similar false positives in the future. âThis is what gets me excited, because itâs automatically improving the algorithm with no human intervention,â he said. âBut itâs also creepy: âHi, Dave. My name is *HAL*{: .small}. How are you doing? I got smarter overnight.âÂ âÂ â¦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59112e62f8fa3e67faf0d229","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a845dd6207318b5db954","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Owen has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1991.

As Owens explains in his new photo book, â[Bill Owens: Altamont 1969](https://www.amazon.com/Bill-Owens-Altamont-Sasha-Frere-Jones/dp/8862086237),â the A.P. wanted to hire him for a day âto cover a rock and roll concert in the Altamont hills.â The Altamont Speedway concert had been reported as the West Coastâs response to Woodstock. It was also part of a return to public view for the Rolling Stones, who had started touring again, after nearly two years off the road. Their efforts began in July, with a free show in Londonâs Hyde Park. The concert was a success, an entirely peaceful event financed and filmed by Granada Television. Security had been provided by a ragtag group of people wearing leather, who the Stones mistakenly believed were part of the Hells Angels. Emboldened, the Stones hired the man who organized the Hyde Park concert, Sam Cutler, to work on an American tour in the fall of 1969\\.\n\nThe band wanted to keep filming its concerts, and, on the recommendation of the cinematographer Haskell Wexler, hired the filmmakers Albert and David Maysles, who had just released âSalesman,â a documentary about Bible salesmen. The Maysles filmed a Stones concert at Madison Square Garden, in November; happy with the outcome, the Stones decided to invest in a full-length film, for a fifty per cent share of the profits. In â[Altamont: The Rolling Stones, the Hells Angels, and the Inside Story of Rockâs Darkest Day](https://www.amazon.com/Altamont-Rolling-Stones-Angels-Darkest/dp/0062444263),â published in 2016, the music journalist Joel Selvin notes that the Stones wanted a âbig finishâ for the film. They learned that Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead were planning a free concert in San Franciscoâs Golden Gate Park and decided theyâd join the bill. The mayor of San Francisco at the time, Joe Aliotoâwho was, according to Selvin, âvery anti-hippieââworked to squash the plans. Sears Point Raceway, in Sonoma, was suggested as an alternative, but that site was owned by a company called Filmways, which had just lost money over a tour date that the Stones cancelled. As payback, the company wanted distribution rights for any film that came out of a Sears Point Raceway concert. The Stones rejected this deal and chose the Altamont Speedway, between the cities of Livermore and Tracy, with security to be provided by the Hells Angels. Construction at the Speedway began on Thursday, December 4th. The show was on Saturday.\n\n\n+++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5c94002e2f0a2c2d279ce0aa]||||||\n\n+++\n\n+++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5c94002e4c50545726e452d6]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\nThe short planning time and lack of official announcements meant that journalists who wanted to cover the event werenât sure where to go, or when. There was no commuter path to the speedway, so people walked along the highway. Bill Owens arrived early and found a lighting tower to shoot from, above the fray. (Lights were scheduled to be attached to those towers but never arrived.) In his photos, you see a vast spill of people without borders or shepherds. Nothing had been done to turn the site into a venue, so most concertgoers could barely see the stage. The only protection for the bands was a piece of sisal twine stretched in front of the crowd; it had disappeared by the time Jefferson Airplane began playing, in the late afternoon. December brought a California winterâmilder than an East Coast winter, but still winterâand the audience didnât have the verve or color of the Woodstock crowd. Nudity was outweighed by corduroy.\n\n\n\n+++feature-medium\n+++group-2\n\n[#image: /photos/5c94023cfc17962d215ffa00]||||||\n\n[#image: /photos/5c94023ddec8304049bc43c2]||||||\n\n+++\n+++\n\n\nThe critic Greil Marcus, then in his mid-twenties, got there early in the morning. âI went right to the front and sat down with the person Iâd come with,â he told me. âIt felt perfectly safe, except for acid casualties, and then the Angels, but people were unfriendly, territorial, selfishâjust a weird reversal of Woodstock, where Iâd been just a few months before. And completely different from the crowd at the Oakland Arena, where the Stones played at the beginning of their tour.â Fights began to break out. As Saul Austerlitz reports in his account, â[Just a Shot Away: Peace, Love, and Tragedy with the Rolling Stones at Altamont](https://www.amazon.com/Just-Shot-Away-Tragedy-Altamont/dp/1250083192/),â published last year, âFour or five plainclothes Alameda County sheriffs stood around backstage, their weapons in their holsters. After intervening in one of the early fights between the Hells Angels and fans, they took note of how thoroughly outnumbered they were, and thereafter ceded the field to the Angels.â\n\n+++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5c9402dbda8d423b16ba6fa1]||||||\n\n+++\n\n+++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5c9402db02c93412cad6d6ce]||||||\n\n\n+++\n\n\nThe Angels had been invited by Cutler and Rock Scully, the manager of the Grateful Dead, who had connections to the Angels in San Francisco. But, when the Dead reached the speedway, bad acid and wine had been flowing for hours, and the injuries were stacking up. The band decided not to play. In the years since, this absence has spared it from much of the blame for what unfolded.\n\n\n+++feature-large\n\n[#image: /photos/5c9bbdf92cb04a70c86db38a]||||||\n\n\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nDozens of people at the concert were beaten by the Angels, with fists and pool cues and whatever else was at hand. Marty Balin, of Jefferson Airplane, was knocked unconscious. Stephen Stills was stabbed repeatedly in the leg, with a sharpened bicycle spoke, by an unknown Angel. Four people died. One young man drowned in an irrigation ditch. Two men were killed in a hit-and-run after the show. A black eighteen-year-old named Meredith Hunter was stabbed multiple times by Alan Passaro, one of the Hells Angels providing security, and died before the Stones had finished playing.\n\n+++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5c9bbd10caf1186a4bcd79bf]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\nA few weeks after the concert, *Rolling Stone* published an exhaustive report titled â[The Rolling Stones Disaster at Altamont: Let It Bleed](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-rolling-stones-disaster-at-altamont-let-it-bleed-71299/).â The piece opens with an account from a witness who later testified at Passaroâs trial. An unidentified Angel, the witness said, âreached over and grabbed the guy beside meââHunter, that isââby the ear and hair, and yanked on it, thinking it was funny, you know, kind of laughing. And so, this guy shook loose; he yanked away from him.â Another Angel âhit him in the mouth,â the witness went on, and Hunter tried to run, âand four other Hellâs Angels jumped on him.â According to the witness, after Passaro stabbed Hunter in the back, Hunter âpulled out a gun and held it up in the air you know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like that was kind of his last resort.â Passaro stabbed him in the neck, and someone, likely Passaro, stabbed him in and around the kidney. Other Angels kicked Hunter, stood on his head, and hit him with a garbage-can lid. Before Hunter died, audience members lifted his body onto the stage and the  Angels pushed it off. In a [photograph](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3750676/The-dark-truth-Jagger-Altamont.html) of the moment taken by Beth Bagby, Mick Jagger, looking dismayed, raises a hand to his face.\n\nSeveral months after the *Rolling Stone* story appeared, the Stones, through a lawyer, sent the Hunter family ten thousand dollars, which Hunterâs sister Dixie Ward described to me as âa very nominal sum.â To this day, the Stones have never spoken to Hunterâs family.\n\nâGimme Shelter,â the movie that the Maysles brothers made about the Stones, was released one year after Altamont; the second half of the movie is dedicated to the concert. Hunterâs murder ends up providing a sort of climax, but his name is never said out loud in the course of the film. Whatâs more, although the *Rolling Stone* report on Altamont made it clear that Hunter was running from the Angels, âGimme Shelterâ implies that Hunter was the real threat. Toward the end of the movie, the footage of Altamont stops abruptly, and the film cuts to Jagger and David Maysles sitting in an editing suite. Maysles replays the footage that was just shown and slows it down to isolate and point out Hunterâs gun, set against the white crocheted dress of Hunterâs girlfriend, Patti Bredehoft. We are treated to a closeup of Jagger, looking sad. The film cuts back to footage of Altamont, where we see Hunter lying on a stretcher, dead. An unidentified bystander says that Hunter âpulled out a gun.â âThe Hells Angels took away the gun. One of them has it now; he showed it to me,â he says. Four months before the movie opened the Cannes Film Festival, Passaro was acquitted of Hunterâs murder.\n\nâAltamontâit could only happen to the Stones,â Keith Richards said to the *Rolling Stone* reporter Robert Greenfield, in 1971\\. Years later, in his memoir, â[Life](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Keith-Richards/dp/031603441X),â Richards emphasized the Grateful Deadâs role in planning the concert and blamed âthe boneheaded, hard-nosed San Francisco councilâ for nixing the plan to play at Golden Gate Park. âIn the film you can see Meredith Hunter waving a pistol and you can see the stabbing,â Richards writes. âHe had a pale lime green suit on and a hat. He was foaming at the mouth too; he was as nuts as the rest.â Hunter was not foaming at the mouth, unless Richards got a view nobody else reported. But Richards was echoing the story told by âGimme Shelter,â which is that Altamont happened not to Hunter or his family but to the Stones. Altamont is where Hunter lost his life. âGimme Shelterâ is where he lost his story.\n\nWard has never seen the film. âI couldnât watch it,â she told me. âAnd my children wouldnât watch. Itâs horrible, because I see him running in my sleep.â\n\n+++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5c9bbd692cb04a70c86db388]||||||\n\n+++\n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nEven before night fell, Bill Owens photographed the Angels battering a concertgoer with pool cues and swarming the stage during Jefferson Airplaneâs set. Like the Grateful Dead, Owens decided that he should leave. The Stones didnât, though, and, if they hadnât performed, Hunter wouldnât have had a show onstage to approach, and Passaro wouldnât have had a boss to protect. Of course, things might have also got worse if the headliner had bailed. But the show went on, Hunter was killed, and, in the decade that followed, both the Dead and the Stones became bigger and more successful.\n\nA great deal has been written about Altamont in the years since, but so much of the language around it has the exonerating blush of the passive: the sixties were ending; the Angels were the Angels; it could only happen to the Stones. There may have been larger forces at work, but the attempt to see Altamont as the end of the sixties obscures the extent to which what happened that night had happened, in different ways, many times before, and has happened many times since. âA young black man murdered in the midst of a white crowd by white thugs as white men played their version of black musicâit was too much to kiss off as a mere unpleasantness,â Greil Marcus wrote, in 1977. Hunter does not appear in Owensâs photos and he is only a body in âGimme Shelter.â It is worth returning to that day and trying to see Meredith Hunter again.\n\n*Bill Owensâs photographs of

(Tickets are thirty-five fifty; V.I.P. treatment is seventy-six fifty.) But for the true Stones fan âExhibitionismâ also gives satisfaction, and a good deal of it comes from the immersive environments created by the showâs curator, Ileen Gallagher.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days before the show opened, Gallagher, wearing a leather motorcycle jacket, was wandering through the event space looking for somewhere to sit.\n\n\n\nâI know just the place!â she declared. Seventeen thousand square feet have been given over to âExhibitionism,â which began at the Saatchi Gallery, in London, and will remain in New York until March. The idea was to create real-seeming historical rooms in which artifacts from the Rolling Stonesâ archives could be âsituated,â and to employ state-of-the-art sound, video, and set design to heighten the experience. The result is something between Madame Tussauds and Tracey Eminâs bed.\n\n\n\nHere is Olympic Studios, where âSympathy for the Devilâ was createdâGallagher based the room on the film that Jean-Luc Godard made of the sessions. Here is the backstage area, where guitars are racked in the order in which they will be needed that night, and a stage managerâs tense voice is saying, over the intercom, âHouse lights down in five, four, threeÂ .Â .Â .â Geeky? Perhaps. Sneakily thrilling? Fasho.\n\n\n\nGallagher turned a corner and arrived at her re-creation of 102 Edith Grove, the one-bedroom flat in Chelsea where Keith, Mick, and Brian all lived together, with sleepovers from Charlie, for thirteen months beginning in the late summer of 1962.\n\n\n\nGallagher, who was born and grew up in Stuyvesant Town, has been a Stones fan since the early seventies. Finding the spot she was looking for, she perched on a couch in the Stonesâ old sitting room. A 1958 Muddy Waters album sat on the table in front of her; there were beer bottles, and an ashtray brimming with butts.\n\n\n\nShe explained that she had honed her skills in the museumification of rock history as the director of exhibitions at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in Cleveland, during the nineties. âThe Rock Hall of Fame was the first to treat rock in a visual-culture way,â she said. âAnd MTV made that possible, because you saw the clothes, and it became about _stuff_.â\n\n\n\nThe problem with re-creating 102 Edith Grove was that there were no good photos of the interior. Gallagher relied mainly on her separate interviews with Mick, Charlie, and Keith, in which she recorded their memories of the place. (Visitors can hear these as they walk around the flat.) Mick recalled that âit smelled really bad and it was, like, people would be sick everywhere and theyâd be, like, leaving dirty plates and dirty food.â Charlie noted, of Brian and Keith, âThey were the laziest buggers in the world. They would never pick anything up, so the sink was always fullÂ .Â .Â . penicillin was growing.â That was because, as Keith explained to Gallagher, âwe were too busy, you know, avidly learning how to be blues players and that was all we had time for.â Also living in the flat was James Phelge, a beatnik, who was the foulest of the lot. âWeâd get back from a gig and Phelge would be standing at the top of the stairs saying, âWelcome home,â pissing on you,â Keith told Gallagher. From this fecund bog sprang one of the greatest songwriting partnerships of all time.\n\n\n\nSo Gallagher made a mess. âBut a period mess,â she noted, curatorially. âThe bottles and crisps are all period.â The heaps of cigarette butts are not; they were smoked by the workmen who built the exhibition in London, and were told to save them. The only item in the flat that is semi-authentic is a wooden guitar, a Valenciaâa replica of one that Keith lost. (Several exhibitions could be mounted from things that Keith has lost.)\n\n\n\nâWhen the band saw Edith Grove, they were thrilled,â Gallagher said proudly. Richards, who has lived for some years on an estate in Weston, Connecticut, previewed the space in London. âIâm home!â he cried upon entering the pigsty. One note from Jagger, who now lives in a mansion not far from Edith Grove: âGet rid of some of those cigarette butts. It wasnât that bad.â\n\n\n\nGallagher kept her eye on the workmen, who were putting the finishing touches on the squalor. âI just have to make sure they donât clean up the wrong stuff,â she said.Â â¦","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/12/recreating-rolling-stones-history","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c842bc86f2c9a2449b4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5c2e1c8741e4c73c088d7779","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Curators","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"curators"},{"id":"5c2e1c872710c62d10815425","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Exhibits","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"exhibits"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2bfcc72cd92d0532","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pop Music","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pop-music"},{"id":"5c2e1cd241c92e2c9b85da9e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rock and Roll","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rock-and-roll"},{"id":"5c2e1ea32bfcc72cd92d0723","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rolling Stones","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rolling-stones"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f0bbebe912338a3717a8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"One Manâs Trash Dept.","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"one-mans-trash-dept"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a89cdf652b705f4a7580","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Seabrook has been a contributor toÂ *The New Yorker* since 1989 and became a staff writer in 1993.

She had been feeling at loose endsâunmarried at the decrepit old age of thirty, and nursing dashed hopes of becoming a writer. Less than a year later, she found herself stationed in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where she met and fell madly in love with [Paul Child](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/portrait-of-a-marriage-julia-child-captured-in-paul-childs-shimmering-photographs), a cartographer and aesthete ten years her senior. They were eventually both transferred to Kunming, China, and then returned to America after the war. They got married, in 1946, and landed, after some time, in France, where Paul worked in the U.S. embassy, and Julia was left to find a way to fill her days. She ended up at Le Cordon Bleu, in a morning class taught entirely in French and attended entirely by American soldiers on the G.I. Bill. The rest is the stuff of gastronomic legend: the love affair with French cuisine, and then the meandering and often tumultuous path to publishing â[Mastering the Art of French Cooking](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Art-French-Cooking-1/dp/0394721780)ââthe two-volume compendium, co-authored with Simone Beck and Louisette Berthold, that would make Julia Child the most famous French chef in the world, despite the fact that she was not a bit French, nor even (as she insisted her entire life) a proper chef.\n\nThe public Julia Childâ[Julia Child the culinary titan](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/12/23/good-cooking)âlooms so large that she often eclipses the person who existed outside the kitchen. Her private sides emerge, in part, in her biographies, especially those written by her nephew, Alex Prudâhomme, as well as in her own voluminous correspondence, much of which is archived at Harvardâs Schlesinger Library. In a new volume, â[Julia Child: The Last Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Julia-Child-Interview-Other-Conversations/dp/1612197337),â a collection of conversations with journalists from throughout her life, the Child on display is quick and insouciant, as one expects her to be, pronouncing on methods for turning mushrooms and the pleasure of making oneâs own vinaigrette. But in nearly four decades her voice evolves, revealing a steadily growing mastery in matters beyond the kitchen: the craft of making public television, for example, and theories of education and academia. A part of Julia that stands out in the volume (for which I wrote the introduction), one that I hadnât previously appreciated, is her passionate political engagement.\n\nChild  grew up in Pasadena, Californiaâin one of the bookâs interviews, a 1989 conversation with the journalist Polly Frost, for *Interview*, she describes herself as âan innocent hayseed from a middle-class, utterly nonintellectual background.â In fact, the McWilliams family was quite well off: Childâs father owned and managed a great deal of land; her mother was the heiress to a modest paper fortune. As Frost points out, Pasadena was not a place known for its liberal values. âI was raised with very conservative beliefs, but that was a long time ago,â Child said. âIn between Iâve lived in a lot of places, which makes a big difference. After a while you decide that you can have your own opinions.â\n\nChildâs political awakening came during the McCarthy era, when she and Paul looked on in horror and rage as their friends and colleagues were subjected to the degradations of anti-Communist paranoia. In a 1991 interview with the journalist Jewell Fenzi, part of an oral-history project chronicling the lives of the spouses of Foreign Service agents, Child recalled when McCarthyâs deputies Roy Cohn and G. David Schine arrived in Europe, in 1953, for an eighteen-day tour intended to root out sedition. âWe had quite a number of people who were just ruined by them,â Child said. In a letter to her longtime friend Avis DeVoto, she spoke with characteristic gallows humor:\n\n> Am terribly worried about McCarthyism, even more so than ever. How\n> could the State Dept. back down on that order about the left-wing\n> material? What pusillanimousity! How cowardly. What can I do as an\n> individual. It is frightening. I am ready to bare my breasts (small\n> cup size though they be), stick out my neck, wonât turn my back on\n> anybody, will sacrifice cat, cookbook, husband and finally\n> self...please advise. Iâm serious.\n\nThe following year, just before Senator McCarthy began his infamous hearings, televised live to a rapt and terrified audience of millions, Child received a letter from Aloise Buckley Heath, a fellow Smith College alumna and the sister of William F. Buckley, Jr., the prominent conservative author and proponent of McCarthyism. Heath had written to Child, and to other Smith graduates, urging them to withhold donations to the institution until the college had sacked five professors suspected of being Communists. An enraged Child replied, âIn the blood-heat of pursuing the enemy, many people are forgetting what we are fighting for. We are fighting for our hard-won liberty and our freedom; for our Constitution and the due processes of our laws; and for the right to differ in ideas, religion and politics. I am convinced that in your zeal to fight against our enemies, you, too, have forgotten what you are fighting for.â \n\nAfter the wild success of âMastering the Art of French Cooking,â Child cultivated an apolitical mien. Her television persona was that of a friend and teacher, not a dinner-party conversationalist. âThe French Chef,â her first television show, ran from 1963 to 1973; while Child was urging her audience to engage with a classical, almost dreamlike version of French culture, actual France was in the midst of a tumultuous, often violent cultural recalibration, under DeGaulleâs fractious leadership. In America, her exhortations for the intellectual and artistic pleasures of cooking were broadcast simultaneously with the rise of womenâs lib, a dissonance with which the show never directly engaged. (Her advocacy for seasonal vegetables, good dairy, and whole ingredients during the post-war golden age of canned and processed food was political only incidentally.) \n\nBut, over the years, as Child became more comfortable with her fame, she spoke more openly about her political beliefs, especially her support for Planned Parenthood and her disgust at the Republican Party. (While notably progressive for someone in her position, she was also very much constrained to the standards of the era for a wealthy, white woman: her perspectives on race and homosexuality, in particular, carry a patronizing air of demi-tolerance that is hard to stomach today.) In 1982, she authored a pledge letter for Planned Parenthood, sent to donors nationwide, which read, âFew politicians will take the risk of publicly supporting either contraception or abortionâand who is âfor abortionâ anyway? We are concerned with freedom of choice.â That same year, she travelled to Memphis, Tennessee, to lead a series of cooking classes to raise money for Planned Parenthood, and was faced each day by a small group of anti-abortion activists protesting her participation. She recalled the incident in the 1989 *Interview* conversation:\n\n> Every time they appeared theyâd have little babies in their arms with\n> signs saying, IF YOU HAD YOUR WAY I WOULDNâT HAVE BEEN BORN. There\n> were only ten in all, but every time they appeared theyâd be\n> photographed by television. Just because they were there, it was news;\n> we who are pro womenâs rights must do a great deal to get our views\n> across.\n\nAt the time of that interview, George H. W. Bush had just assumed the Presidency, replacing Ronald Reagan and extending many of his policies. The Administration seemed uninterested in âdoing anything about the environment,â Child said, in the same interview with Polly Frost, adding, âThese people are anti-abortion, but theyâre not doing anything for the future.â She went on, âIf we go on as we are, polluting everything, we may very well end up like Venus, a great ball of fire. And I donât think we have very much time.â Two years later, an eighty-one-year-old Child told Fenzi, the journalist compiling the oral-history project, âthe American Institute of Wine and Food, thatâs mostly what I do now. That, and I am very much interested in Planned Parenthood, and Smith College, and the Democratic Party.â\n\nI attended Smith College some seventy years after Child. She was one of the institutionâs most luminous graduates, certainly our most famous, and, when I was a student, she, already in her late eighties, would still make the trip from her home in Cambridge to visit her alma mater. I never met her, though I saw her once during my sophomore year, from a distance, making her way across the grassy campus. Reading the fiery letter she wrote to Aloise Buckley Heath, I wonder what Child would think about the darkness of America today, in some ways a reiteration of the bleak miasma of McCarthyism, and in other ways unique. In the closing paragraph of her letter, Child wrote that she not only refused to accede to Heathâs demand that alumnae withhold donations from Smith but that she would be sending an additional check. âI am confident that our Trustees and our President know what they are doing,â she wrote. âThey are only too well aware of the dangers of totalitarianism, as it is always the great institutions of learning that are attacked first in any police state. For the colleges harbor the âdangerousâ people, the people who know how to think, whose minds are free.â\n\n*This piece was adapted from the introduction to â[Julia Child: The Last Interview

One table was too small, another too far from the windows. Chinese waiters flew about in response to his urgent commands. Mrs. Kan, the proprietor, hastening to the scene, exchanged ceremonious greetings with Paul and Julia Child and was introduced to Rosemary Manell and Elizabeth Bishop, who would be assisting Julia throughout the next week in a series of cooking demonstrations for the benefit of the Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco. Mrs. Kan was deeply honored by the presence in her restaurant of Julia Child, whose television show, âThe French Chef,â is well known in San Francisco, but also deeply distressed, for she had not expected the visit. At length, the Child party was seated at a large table near the center of a big, elegant second-floor room that overlooks the cityâs Chinese quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nâJulia would like it if you ordered for all of us,â Mrs. Manell said to Mrs. Kan. Julia nodded, beaming. She had lost her voice two days before, in Seattle, where she had given a series of four cooking demonstrations for the benefit of St. Markâs Cathedral. At a cocktail party following one of the demonstrations, she had swallowed an hors dâoeuvre that contained a very hot pepper, and a doctor she consulted seemed to think this might have been the cause of it. She was not supposed to use her voice, and she was communicating with facial expressions, gestures, and notes written with a felt-tip pen on a white pad. Whenever she scribbled a note to Mrs. Kan, Mrs. Kan took the pad and pen and wrote out her reply. Mrs. Bishop explained that this wasnât really necessary, since Julia could hear perfectly well, but Mrs. Kan seemed to think it impolite to reply orally to a written message.\n\n\n\nMrs. Kanâs selections began with barbecued spareribs, served as an hors dâoeuvre, and progressed to fried squid. âFresh frying fat makes all the difference,â Julia wrote when she had tasted it. Mrs. Kan wrote back, âAn expert such as you knows!â The squid was followed by diced-winter-melon soup, pale green and delicately flavored (âDoes it look like cat vomit?â Julia inquired in a note not shown to Mrs. Kan), and then by lemon chicken, Kanâs special noodles flavored with chicken and coriander, asparagus with beef, and bean cake with barbecued pork. Two other diners sent complimentary greetings to the Childsâ table, and their waiter told them that everyone wanted to know what Julia was having (nobody in America calls her anything but Julia). As the meal continued, Julia scribbled faster and faster, and asked the others to read her notes aloud, so there could be the appearance of conversation. âIsnât this far better than that hot Szechwan stuff?â she wrote. âPaul and I lived 1Â½ years in China and never had it. I wonder if it really exists there.â The Childs lived in China during the Second World WarâKunming, in fact, was the scene of their courtship, while they were both working for the Office of Strategic Servicesâand they have retained ever since a keen interest in Chinese cooking. Julia Child does not do any Chinese cooking herself, because she feels that one lifetime is hardly sufficient to encompass the cuisines of France, her specialty, but she loves to go to Chinese restaurants. âI would be perfectly happy w. only Chinese food,â she wrote. âEither French or Chinese. Could live w. only Chinese.â\n\n\n\nMrs. Kan wanted the Childs to see the kitchen. She also wanted to take their picture, and she refused to let them pay for the meal. Paul Child made certain that the photo would not be used as an endorsement for KanâsââWe never do thatââand he said that they always paid for meals in restaurants. âWe must be very careful, no payola,â Julia wrote on her pad. âRemember Watergate!â Mrs. Kan smiled firmly. Everyone got up and went into the kitchen, where Julia inspected mysterious vessels and vats, and put her arm around the chef. The chef, who stood a good eighteen inches short of Juliaâs six feet one and a half, seemed absolutely delighted.\n\n\n\nGoing back to the hotel in a taxi, Paul was upset that he had not been permitted to pay for the meal. âShe was so determined,â he said. âI didnât want to do _battle_ over it.â\n\n\n\nâWeâll send her a book,â Julia wrote. And a little later, in a note to Mrs. Bishop, âWe must all help to cheer up Paul. He gets depressed when anything wrong w. wife.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe Childs and their associates were at about the midpoint of a demonstration tour that had begun in Seattle and would conclude in Honolulu. There were to be eight cooking demonstrations in San Francisco, at the Kabuki Theatre, in the new Japan Center on Geary Street. They had flown in from Seattle on a Thursday, four days in advance of the first demonstration, and they needed all of the time they had to get ready. In their comfortable suite at the Clift Hotel, the Childs, Mrs. Manell, and Mrs. Bishop spent hours going over lists, schedules, and recipes in thick loose-leaf notebooks. Other lists had preceded themâlists of cooking equipment and food staples and hardware and supplies of all kinds, which the Womenâs Board of Presbyterian Hospital of Pacific Medical Center, co-sponsor of the event along with Liberty House, the San Francisco branch of the Honolulu department store, had agreed to provide. The Womenâs Board had done its job with great zealâhad provided, in fact, more than fifteen hundred separate items, from a stove and a refrigerator down to rolls of paper towels and packages of scouring pads. (Many of the utensils were going to be raffled off to ticket buyers after the demonstrations.) There were always a number of things, like fresh vegetables, that could only be bought at the last minute, however, and Mrs. Manell and Mrs. Bishop were responsible for getting those. The dishes to be cooked onstage at the Kabuki were all fairly spectacular. Having more or less invented what could be called the theatre of television, Julia was not going to let her audiences down, and the stage, she knew, required larger effects than the home screen. She would give San Francisco her Caneton en Aspic Ã  la Parisienne and Charlotte Malakoff, Beef Wellington and Quiche aux Asperges, Le Loup en CroÃ»te and CrÃªpes Ã  la Pagode en Flammes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Saturday, two days before the first demonstration, Juliaâs voice had returned. Her younger sister Dorothy (Mrs. Ivan Cousins), who lives in Sausalito, had sent her to a throat specialist well known for treating opera singers and other performers, and he had painted and sprayed Juliaâs aggrieved larynx so skillfully that she was able to go through with a scheduled press conference at the Kabuki Theatre that morning. Julia and Paul sat for an hour at a small table in the theatre lobby, which Liberty House had turned into a festive-looking culinary boutique for the demonstrations, and replied in their quite different conversational stylesâcheery, gracious, down-to earth in Juliaâs case, precise and urbane in Paulâsâto the not invariably stimulating questions of a dozen or so food and feature editors. Julia recommended that newcomers to cooking approach it âwith courage and daring.â\n\n\n\nPaul said they should not be afraid of hard work. Julia said cooking wasnât really hard once you mastered the essential techniques. Paul said that mastering the techniques required much hard work. Julia came out against the term âgourmet,â which she said had lost all meaning through overuse (âWe just say âgood cookingâÂ â), and she also had harsh words for the frozen stringbean. A bearded reporter who said that he was from the Gay Liberation Press announced that he and his friends were coming to all the demonstrations. (âI think itâs very good theyâre coming out of the closet,â Julia said later.) Since nobody asked her about cholesterol, Julia brought up the subject herself. It was a very bad idea, she said, to think that you could cut out all foods that were high in cholesterol, as those were often the healthiest foods. Everyone needed a balanced diet. âWeâve done research on this,â she said, âand weâve found that some doctors believe a completely cholesterol-free diet can lead to premature aging and sexual frailty.â\n\n\n\nAlthough the press conference was a great success, the publicity for the cooking demonstrations had been, up to this point, somewhat disappointing. Only one major story had appeared in a San Francisco paper (the _Chronicle_), and that one had printed the wrong telephone number to call for tickets and reservations. Tickets for each demonstration were priced at fifteen dollars, and advance sales had been slowâpartly, it was thought, because San Franciscans were nervous about the so-called zebra murders, and were afraid to go out in the evening. With Juliaâs arrival, though, the trickle of publicity became a flood, and ticket sales picked up. [#unhandled_cartoon] \n\n\n\nâThis is such an American custom, the way these affairs are run by volunteer women,â Paul Child said that afternoon. âItâs practically unheard of in Europe.â Barbara Grant, the president of the Womenâs Board, and Hannah Foster, the vice-president, and their colleagues had started eight months before to prepare for the 1974 benefit. It had been Mrs. Fosterâs idea to invite Julia Childâin previous years the Womenâs Boardâs fund-raising had centered on an annual dÃ©butante ball. Mrs. Foster, Mrs. Grant, and several others on the benefit committee put in long hours throughout the Childsâ stay in San Francisco, running errands for the cooking team, washing dishes and pots from the stage kitchen, briefing volunteer ushers, selling tickets, and not infrequently pressing their husbands into service as well. Only one or two of the people connected with the Womenâs Board seemed to be what Julia refers to as âlady typesââthe type that comes into a kitchen, sees several stacks of unwashed utensils, and asks, âIs there anything I can do?â\n\n\n\nAfter inspecting the rather elaborate cooking setup that had been provided for them on the Kabuki stageâa made-to-order kitchen flanked by large hanging screens to pick up television images of what Julia would be doing from three video cameras mounted directly above the work spacesâthe Childs were a little worried that the benefit committee might have spent too lavishly. âIn Seattle,â Paul said, âwe performed in the auditorium of the cathedral, on a set put together mostly from found objects. Somebody had contributed a stove, another person a refrigerator, and there were chests of drawers for work spaces and a couple of child-sized tables under the counters for shelves. It was really very clever and workable, and it didnât cost much.â The financing of these demonstrations does not directly concern the Childs, who derive no money from them personally. They donate all their fees to WGBH-TV, in Boston, the public-television station where âThe French Chefâ originated, in 1962. The tour expenses are paid by the sponsor group (WGBH picks up any extra, and the Childs look upon the rather considerable effort and time involved mainly as a means of generating favorable publicity for Juliaâs booksâthe monumental âMastering the Art of French Cooking,â Volumes I and II, and a book of recipes from their television shows, called âThe French Chef Cookbook.â Nevertheless, both the Childs wanted the hospital to make money from the San Francisco demonstrations, and they were somewhat alarmed to hear that the benefit committee had already spent something like thirty thousand dollars on expenses. Liberty House had donated most of the cooking equipment, and Safeway Stores had provided quantities of free staples, but there had been heavy outlays for the construction of the model kitchen on the stage of the Kabuki Theatre. An eight-hundred-and-fifty-seat house fitted out with tables for the audience to dine at while watching a performance, the theatre had been designed for the presentation of traditional Kabuki drama, but evidently there had not been enough Kabuki-lovers in town to support it, so management was planning to use the space for stage shows of various kinds. At one point, the management had added to the benefit committeeâs difficulties by trying, unsuccessfully, to cancel its one-week lease on the theatre.\n\n\n\nThe Childs refused almost all invitations to dinner or to cocktails in the days before the first demonstration. âWe want to put on a good show,â Julia explained, âand we just canât spare the time.â Lunches for the Childs and their two assistants were cooked by Rosemary Manell in the demonstration kitchen, and they ate them at a table in the wings. (Later, when they were giving demonstrations each afternoon and evening, they had dinner there as well.) They spent the weekend at the theatre, stocking and setting up for the first show and doing the necessary pre-cooking. A great deal of pre-cooking is done for Juliaâs television series; a dish may have to be shown in three or four different stages of preparation, and since the twenty-eight minutes of allotted air time does not allow for the completion of these stages, versions of the dish at each stage must be ready to show. In a three-hour live demonstration, much of the actual cooking does take place onstage, but puff pastry and yeast doughs must be made ahead so they can rise, backups are needed in case of onstage disasters, and cold ducks (for Caneton en Aspic) must be cooked in advance. Rosemary Manell and Elizabeth Bishop, who had both been on previous demonstration tours, knew the names that Julia and Paul assign to every item of equipment and every work space (to save time in explaining or describing), and they were even allowed access to the Sacred Bag, a phenomenally heavy black canvas satchel containing certain cooking items that Julia cannot do without (her favorite bone flour scoop, her large pastry-cutting wheel, her special knives, and so on), plus emergency items such as extension cords, of which there are never enough on hand. The Sacred Bag has been around since the beginning of the television series.\n\n\n\nThe Childs had known Rosemary Manell since 1949, when they were all together in France. Paul Child and Abram Manell, Rosemaryâs husband, were both with the Foreign Service then, and the two couples, who shared an interest in good food which in Juliaâs case was becoming something more than an interest, used to dine together regularly in the Childsâ apartment, on the Rue de lâUniversitÃ©, or the Manellsâ, on the Ãle St.-Louis. Rosie, as the Childs and their friends (but no one else) call her, now lives in Belvedere, just across the bay from San Francisco. She is a talented painter and potter, an expert tailor, a first-class cook; she wears Scandinavian-blond hair in a thick braid down her back, and is nearly as tall as Julia.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Bishop, a Bostonian with close-cropped dark hair and a sense of humor that has often relieved tension at difficult moments, was one of the volunteers who came to work for âThe French Chefâ at WGBH. When the show started, Paul did all the behind-scenes washing upâand a good deal of the chopping, grating, mincing, and pre-cooking as well. He had only recently resigned from the Foreign Service, after nearly twenty years, but because he has always adapted easily to changed circumstances, and suffers from no apparent insecurities of the male ego, he took, from the outset, an active and supportive part in Juliaâs new career. âIâm here,â Paul used to say. âIâll do anything.â But as the program developed, it soon became evident that more backstage help was needed, and, with no difficulty whatsoever, a crew of half a dozen volunteers was formed. Several of the women were married and had small children at home; they hired babysitters or housekeepers to come and do the dishes there while they went to the WGBH studio in Cambridge and spent the day doing the dishes for Julia. Actually, they did much of the pre-cooking and testing for the show. Julia sometimes introduces them on the air. âMeet my associate cooks,â she says. âMary OâBrien, Liz Bishop, Bess Hopkins, Edith Seltzer, Rita Rains, Bess Coughlin, and Gladys Christopherson. Itâs always more fun cooking with friends, donât you think?â Mrs. Bishop lives in Cohasset, Massachusetts, with her husband and their three children, and when âThe French Chefâ was in production she often did not get home until one or two oâclock in the morning. Now that the Childs are taking a year off from television and the show is being seen only in reruns, she is delighted to be able to travel with them on their demonstration tours. âCooking is the least of it,â she told a friend in San Francisco. âYou know, in a funny way I feel closer to Julia than I do to anyone. Of course Iâm _closer_ to Jack and the children, but there are things I could say to her that I couldnât say to anyone else.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nJulia Child was born Julia Carolyn McWilliams in Pasadena, California, in 1912. The oldest of three children in a moderately well-to-do familyâher father, John McWilliams, managed some family farming land in Arkansas and southern Californiaâshe was entered in Smith College the day she was born. âMy mother was in the Class of 1900 there,â she said recently, âand there was just never any doubt that I would go. In those days, people were very enthusiastic about their college.â As a member of Smithâs Class of 1934, Julia was planning to be a Great Woman Novelist. âThey laughed when I sat down at the typewriter,â she told an interviewer in San Francisco. âAnd they were right, too, because nothing much ever came of the plan. I wrote for the Smith College _Tatler,_ and after I graduated I went home for a while, and then I went to New York and tried to get a job with _The New Yorker_, but they turned me down. The woman-novelist idea was very vague and unformed. I just thought it would develop at some time or other.â After three years in New York, working in the advertising department of W. & J. Sloane and living with two Smith classmates in an apartment under the Queensboro Bridge, she went back home and spent another two years in Pasadena. âI had a very good time doing virtually nothing,â she said. âThere was always lots of fun and laughter.â Then the war came, and on the advice of her friend Janie McBaine (who subsequently married Marquis Childs) she went to Washington and got what she describes as âa dreadful typing jobâ with a government information agency whose nickname was Mellettâs Madhouse. After six months, she left and joined the Office of Strategic Services. At one point, there was a call for volunteers for overseas duty, and Julia McWilliams, reasoning that she would probably be going to Europe after the war in any case, put in for Far Eastern duty. With an oddly assorted group that included the anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Cora Du Bois and a congeries of explosives experts, forgers who had done time in federal prisons, and some missionaries who had been born in the Far East, she travelled by troop train across the United States and then by boat to Australia and on to Bombay, arriving the same day that two ammunition ships caught fire and blew up a large part of the Bombay docks. From Bombay, some of them went by train across the Indian subcontinent to Madras, and from there to Ceylon. It was at the O.S.S. headquarters in Ceylon that she met Paul Child.\n\n [#unhandled_cartoon] \n\n\n\nChild, who got to Ceylon a few months after Julia, was in charge of Visual Presentation for the O.S.S. there. That meant, for the most part, setting up and maintaining a war room for the general staff, with maps and charts to show the areas, topographies, troop concentrations, and other factors on which military planning depended. (He had recently come from New Delhi, where he had set up a war room for Lord Louis Mountbatten and General Wedemeyer.) Julia was placed in charge of the Registry, a document center for messages to and from O.S.S. agents in the field. She noticed the Visual Presentation officer because he seemed, on the whole, to be more civilized than anyone else there. Paul was ten years older than Julia, and he had seen a lot of the world. He had been a lumberman in Maine and a waiter in Hollywood, and he was a self-taught artist. During the twenties, he had knocked about Europe, spending several years in Paris, where he got to know Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and other expatriates; that supposedly golden decade had been a rather penurious one for Child, who had made a marginal living by selling his own woodcuts and making copies of the antique furniture in the Cluny Museum. After that, he had become a schoolteacher, first in France and later at the Shady Hill School, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and at the Avon Old Farms School, near Hartford, Connecticut, where he taught art and French. He was, in addition, an accomplished engraver and photographer, a black belt in judo, a master of several languages, and a man who could converse interestingly and amusingly on almost any subject. Although a more or less confirmed bachelor by this time, Child also noticed Julia McWilliams. âShe seemed like a pretty great woman to me,â he recalled recently. âShe was completely competent, unflappableâjust the way she is nowâand running a very complicated operation with great skill.â\n\n\n\nAt this stage of the war, late in 1943, the Americans and the British were planning an operation to cut off the Japanese garrison in Singapore by making a surprise landing behind enemy lines on the Malay Peninsula. This plan was abandoned when it became evident that the required naval support was not availableâeverything was going into the approaching invasion of Normandy. Child was sent to help set up other war rooms on the Chinese mainland, at Chungking, and then at Kunming. Julia McWilliams was also assigned to Kunming, and the friendship begun in Ceylon developed into something more serious. Kunming, which had never been in Japanese hands, was full of refugees from all parts of China. There was enough food available; and Paul and Julia were able to sample and become enthusiastic about many different Chinese cuisines. They were in Kunming when the Japanese surrendered. Soon afterward, Paul made his way home by way of Peking. Juliaâs detachment was scheduled to go to Shanghai, but, with the war over, the unitâs morale was not what it had been. âI felt weâd lost the purity of our purpose,â Julia said recently. âYou can see Iâm a Victorian woman at heart. Anyway, I decided to go home. They flew me over the hump to Calcutta and loaded me onto a troopship, from which I disembarked, weeks later, smelling, as somebody said, like a cattle boat.â\n\n\n\nA reunion took place several months later in Washington. âWe had decided that we should look each other over in civilian clothes, and that we should meet each otherâs families,â Julia recalls. That done, they were married in the fall of 1946. Julia was thirty-four, Paul forty-four. For the first year and a half, they lived in Washington. The Office of Strategic Services had been discontinued, but O.S.S. people who had been in Visual Presentation were automatically absorbed into the State Department, and Paul was now doing graphic work for the government. Early in 1948, by a happy official stroke, he was assigned to the United States Information Service office in Paris.\n\n\n\nFrance was not at all the way Julia had imagined it. âIâd never met any French people before,â she said not long ago, âand I thought theyâd be, you know, snippy, the way they always seemed in _Harper_â_s Bazaar_ or _Vogue_. I was just amazed to get off the boat at Le Havre and see all those great big beefy people. We drove to Rouen and had lunch there at the Couronne, and I was euphoric. I was practically in hysterics from the time we landed. Of course, I didnât realize how difficult it was going to be for me to learn the language. It was two years, really, before I could get along in it, and four years before I was fluent. But from the beginning I just fell in love with everything I saw. It took me a long time to get over my infatuationânow they canât fool me so easily.â\n\n\n\nThe Childs found a comfortable third-floor apartment on the Rue de lâUniversitÃ©, behind the Chambre des DÃ©putes. Paul could walk across the Pont de la Concorde to his office, on the Faubourg du St.-HonorÃ©. At first, Julia spent most of her time at Berlitz, struggling with the language. Both the Childs readily concede that at this point her cooking left a good deal to be desired. Paul knew and appreciated good food, but Julia, like many American women of her background, had never really learned to cook at home, and until she married Paul she had never been interested in learning. In the fall of 1949, though, she was sufficiently interested to enroll in a special early-morning course at the Cordon Bleu cooking school, where she found herself the only woman studentâthe twelve others were ex-G.I.s, learning cooking on the G.I. Bill of Rights. âI would leave home at seven in the morning, cook all morning with the G.I.s, and then rush home to make lunch for Paul,â Julia remembers. âIâd give him the bÃ©arnaise or the hollandaise sauce Iâd just learned, or something equally rich. In about a week we both got terribly bilious.â\n\n\n\nThe Cordon Bleu, founded in the nineteenth century, once served as a cooking school for orphans, to help them make their way in life. By the nineteen-thirties, it had become a place where well-to-do housewives (many of them Americans) sent their servants to learn the techniques of the classic cuisine. In modern times, it has not been a professional schoolâto become a professional chef in France one has to serve as an apprentice for years in a restaurant or hotel kitchen, and that training is often supplemented by attendance at a government-sponsored technical institution. But the Cordon Bleu hired professional chefs as teachers, and when Julia enrolled, in 1949, the teaching was excellent. Two of the three chefs whom Julia had as teachers were in their seventies: Max Bugnard, who had owned his own restaurant in Brussels before the war, and Claude Thillmont, for many years the pastry chef at the CafÃ© de Paris. The third was a younger manâPierre Mangelatte, who was the chef at an excellent small restaurant in Montmartre, the Restaurant des Artistes.\n\n\n\nâBugnard was a marvellous meat cook, a marvellous sauce-maker, wonderful with stocks and vegetables, although not so much with desserts,â Julia recalls. âAs a young man, he had known Escoffier. Chef Thillmont had worked in the twenties with Mme. Saint-Ange on her great cookbook, âLe Livre de Cuisine de Mme. Saint-Ange,â now unfortunately out of print. Those two men knew just about everything there was to know. And in the afternoons we would have demonstration classes by Mangelatte, who was a brilliant technician.â Julia had just enough French by this time to keep up with the instruction. Her interest in the subject, she found, was limitless. âUntil I got into cooking,â she once said, âI was never _really_ interested in anything.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nMarie-Antoine CarÃªme (1784-1833), celebrated gastronome, personal chef (successively) to Talleyrand, Czar Alexander I, George IV, and Baron Rothschild, author of five classic books on food, is generally considered the founder of _la grande cuisine._ On the Sunday evening before the cooking demonstrations began at the Kabuki Theatre, the Chefs Association of the Pacific Coast presented its CarÃªme Medal to Julia Child, at a dinner given in her honor in a private dining room at the Jack Tar Hotel. The dinner began, surprisingly, with matzo-ball soup, continued with a seafood coquille, paused for sherbet, forged onward with Beef Wellington, a potato basket, and cucumber salad, and concluded with a chocolate bombe and petits fours. In draping the CarÃªme Medal around Juliaâs neck, the president of the association spoke of her as âthe person who brought classic cooking into American homesâ and âthe one chef in the country who has the recognition that we are all striving for.â A few of the chefs at the long table seemed to harbor reservations about the awardâs going, for the first time, to a womanâJoe Rivas, the principal chef for the Pam Pam chain of restaurants in San Francisco, said firmly that women would never make it as chefs in major restaurants, because they were not strong enough physicallyâbut virtually every one of them, including Rivas, wanted to meet Julia and shake her hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a good deal of talk at the dinner about the shortage of qualified chefs in this country and the absence of professional cooking schools. The Pacific Coast chefs, most of whom seemed to be European-born and in their late fifties or sixties, bemoaned the fact that so few younger men were coming up to take their places. Julia said that unfortunately the same thing was now true in France. Fewer and fewer people wanted to put in the long hours that a first-class restaurant, or even a humble village bakery, demanded. Convenience foods were taking over in restaurants as well as in private households. There were some great young chefs at work, to be sureâJulia mentioned in particular Roger VergÃ©, whose Hostellerie Moulin de Mougins, near Cannes, had just received its third star in the _Guide Michelin._ But, as Paul Child pointed out, men like VergÃ© and Paul Bocuse and the Troisgros brothers did not write down what they had learned or invented, and their discoveries would probably die with them. âNowadays, everybody likes to run down Escoffier,â Julia said, âbut nobodyâs doing what he did to preserve the great traditions.â\n\n\n\n_âShe_â_s_ doing it,â Paul said, pointing at his wife.\n\n\n\nâOh, but Iâm doing it for the home. Somebody should be doing it for the profession, the way Escoffier did.â\n\n\n\nâNobody has that kind of dedication,â Paul said. [#unhandled_cartoon] \n\n\n\nWhat Paul had in mind was the dedication that went into âMastering the Art of French Cooking,â on which Julia and two collaborators worked without interruption for ten years. The bookâs phenomenal successâthe first volume alone has sold more than a million and a quarter copies in America to dateâsuggests that perhaps the traditional _haute cuisine_ of France may be moving not only from the restaurant to the private home (where it began) but from the Old World to the New. Only a few long-established, all-purpose cookbooks, such as Irma Rombauerâs âJoy of Cooking,â have sold more copies in hardcover. There are many young couples in America who start out conjugal life with what they refer to simply as âJulia Childâ and continue to use it more or less exclusively ever after. A woman who lives on the Alaskan tundra has written to say that she is cooking her way through âJulia Child.â The wife of a forest ranger in New Mexico, who lives sixty miles from the nearest town, is doing the same. Much of the bookâs success, of course, is directly related to the even more phenomenal success of Julia Child as a television personality, but it seems reasonable to assume that anyone who puts down twelve-fifty for the book is not just going to leave it out on the cocktail table. A lot of dedicated French cooking does seem to be going on.\n\n\n\nJulia had no intention at first of getting involved in the book, which she heard about soon after a friend in Paris had introduced her to Simone (Simca) Beck. Mme. Beck had started to work, with another friend of hers, named Louisette Bertholle, on a book about French cooking for Americans. âSimca was very much like me,â Julia has said. âA middle-class person who was extremely interested in cooking. She had gone to the Cordon Bleu in the old, prewar days, when Henri Pellaprat was teaching there. I knew nobody then who was really _deeply_ interested in cooking. I had nobody to talk to about it, and so when I met Simca we just fell into each otherâs arms. She and Louisette introduced me into the Cercle des Gourmettes, which is a French ladiesâ gastronomical societyâfounded, I think, in 1927. The Cercle met every two weeks, and there was a chef to give instruction. By the time I joined it, most of the members were in their seventies, and they would never arrive until about noon, in time for the apÃ©ritif and lunch. Simca and Louisette and I would arrive at nine-thirty, so we got what amounted to private lessons from the chef. It was my introduction to really sophisticated French food and livingâfoie gras in season, and lobster dishes, and very elaborate ways of doing things. Anyway, I knew that Simca and Louisette were working on a big book, and that they needed an American collaboratorâtheyâd had one, a man, who didnât work out for some reasonâbut I had no interest in it then. The book was their affair.\n\n\n\nâWhat happened next was that some friends of ours from California came to Paris and, knowing about my interest in cooking, said, âWhy donât you teach us?â Simca, who is always enthusiastic, said, âWhy not?â And so the very next day we started our school, which we called the Ãcole des Trois Gourmandes. Our apartment was the perfect place for it, because we had a big, airy kitchen on the upper floor (it was a two-floor apartment) with a dumbwaiter that brought things down to the dining room. We engaged two of my Cordon Bleu chefs, Bugnard and Thillmont, to come in once or twice a week. There were never more than six in the classâmostly Americans, but one or two French. We would cook all morning, then sit down and eat it, with Paul at the head of the table to pour the wine. If you brought a guest, you had to pay five hundred francs. We three found that we were absolutely fascinated with teaching.â\n\n\n\nSometime in 1951, Julia was persuaded to become the American collaborator on the cookbook. She had her own ideas about the project, however, one of them being that it should be a âreal teaching bookâ rather than a mere collection of recipes. With the shining exception of Mme. Saint-Angeâs classic, most of the available books for serious students of French cooking were little more than a chefâs shorthand notes for the various dishes; unless the reader knew beforehand how to make a white Sauce or poach a trout, or how to add egg yolks to a hot sauce without making it curdle, the book was not much help. Julia thought that every step and every technique should be thoroughly explained, and that the reasoning behind the various techniques should also be made clear. The essence of French cooking, she has often said, is knowing the properties of each ingredient and cooking it in such a way that its best points are fully brought out. If the purpose of their book was to overcome the American fear of âelaborateâ French cuisine, one of the methods would be to leave nothing outâto describe, for example, what a dish should look like and feel like at each stage in its preparation, and also to discuss some of the things that could go wrong during the process, along with corrective measures. This meant long recipesâpages and pages long in many cases. (The longest is the twenty-two-page recipe for French bread in Volume II of âMastering the Art of French Cooking,â an adaptation of the professional bakerâs art to the home kitchen that Julia and Paul, who collaborated on the research, regard as probably their most important contribution so far.) It also meant a prodigious amount of research (two years on French bread alone), testing, and often impassioned argument among the three authors.\n\n\n\nFrom 1952 on, much of the argument was by mail. After four years in Paris, Paul Child was transferred to Marseilles, and then, two years later, to the Embassy in Bonn, where he was exhibits officer, and where the Childs acquired a reputation for oddness because they did not spend much time in the Embassyâs housing compound or swim in the swimming pool there (they preferred a pool on the other side of the Rhine), and because Paul did not spend weekends polishing his car. Paul concedes that he never really became reconciled to the bureaucratic aspects of government service. He and Julia had been unable to have children, and their primary interests were aesthetic and culinary. Julia was always well liked by the other Embassy wivesâshe was too delightful not to beâand her social talents were a notable asset to Paul in his career. âI canât tell you how important it is for a Foreign Service officer to have a partner like Julia,â Paul said one day in San Francisco. At the same time, she was putting a great deal of time and energy into research on the bookâexperimenting and testing, amassing a private library and clipping file on the subject, exchanging information and ideas with her collaborators. One epic argument with Simone Beck, over the proper ingredients of the _vrai cassoulet,_ consumed sixty single-spaced typewritten pages before it was finally resolved.\n\n\n\nIn the spring of 1951, Julia wrote a sample chapter and an outline of the book, had several copies made, and sent them to various friends in the United States. One of the recipients was Avis DeVoto, Bernard DeVotoâs wife. Some time before, in his monthly column in _Harperâs,_ DeVoto had written a diatribe against the stainless-steel paring knife, which, he complained, would not take an edge or perform any useful kitchen function. Julia saw the column in Paris, wrote him a letter expressing vigorous agreement, and enclosed a French paring knife with a good, sharpenable carbon-steel blade. Avis DeVoto had written a friendly reply, and a correspondence had sprung up. âWe both liked to write letters,â Mrs. DeVoto said recently, âand there was a lot to write about. The McCarthy thing was heating up in Washington. Julia and Paul were bewildered and rather frightened by it. Sometimes weâd write each other three or four times a week.â According to Mrs. DeVoto, Julia was a pretty bad writer at that point. The sample chapter of the cookbook struck her as âmuddy, verbose, and awkward,â and the spelling was atrocious. âBut I knew the minute I saw it that this book on French cooking was really going to work,â she said. âIâm not a bad cook, and I could see this was a whole new approach.â She took it around to Houghton Mifflin, the publisher of several of her husbandâs books. Although the response there was somewhat mixed, Houghton Mifflin gave the authors a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar advance and told them to have the book finished in a yearâs time.\n\n\n\nSix years later, having decided that their research demanded a multi-volume cookbook, the authors delivered an eight-hundred-page typescript that dealt, solely and exhaustively, with recipes for poultry and sauces. âThat was my fault,â Julia said last spring. âIâve always done the writing, and the whole thing was much too detailed and academic. It was my conception that everyone would be interested in knowing, for example, that if you didnât happen to have a suffocated duck on hand you could get the same effect by using pigâs blood.â Not surprisingly, Houghton Mifflin turned it down. The Childs were in Washington at the time; Paul had been recalled from Bonn in 1956. Simone Beck had come over to visit them, and the Childs met her at the bus station with the bad news. âThe despair in the waiting room could have been cut with a knife,â according to Julia. âBut then Simca, with her unfailing optimism, said we would just have to do it over again.â The Childs left soon afterward for Paulâs new post, in Oslo, and Julia spent the next year rewriting the book. [#unhandled_cartoon] \n\n\n\nAlthough the second version covered more culinary ground and seemed to Avis DeVoto greatly improved in content and prose style (âI never thought anyone could really learn to write,â she said, âbut Julia didâshe taught herself, with help from Paul and one or two other peopleâ), Houghton Mifflin again found it unpublishable. Mrs. DeVoto submitted it next to William Koshland, at Alfred Knopf. She knew that Koshland liked to cook, and she urged him and Judith Jones, another Knopf editor interested in good food, to take it home and try out some of the recipes. Judith Jones was immediately convinced. âI was sure it was revolutionary,â she said recently. âIt was like having a teacher right there beside you in the kitchen, and everything really worked.â Koshland liked it, too, and kept trying recipes out of it at home, but other editors at Knopf were uncertain. Time passed. From Oslo came increasingly anguished letters from Julia, inquiring whether ten yearsâ work was down the drain. Eventually, the _fins becs_ at Knopf prevailed over the doubters. The first volume of âMastering the Art of French Cookingâ came out in the fall of 1961, to virtually unanimous praise. Craig Claiborne called it âprobably the most comprehensive, laudable, and monumental work on the subject,â written âwithout compromise or condescension.â The late Michael Field said that it âsurpasses every other American book on French cooking in print today.â The New York food establishment, which is not known for its generosity of spirit, took the book and the authors to its collective bosom, and Dione Lucas even gave a dinner for the Childs at The Egg Basket, her restaurant on East Fifty-seventh Street. Houghton Mifflin has been regretting its decision ever since.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAt ten oâclock on Monday morning, Julia stood at the counter of the onstage kitchen at the Kabuki Theatre, pounding out chilled pastry dough with giant blows of a rolling pin and occasionally popping a small piece of it into her mouth. (âI love uncooked dough, donât you?â) Rosie Manell was cutting green beans and red pimientos into tiny strips, with which Julia would decorate the duck aspic according to a pattern drawn in colored inks by Paul. Liz Bishop was glazing a duck, and Paul was rewriting the scripts for a group of fundraising appeals that Julia had agreed to tape later in the week for KQED, the local public-television station. In contrast with the anxious manner of some of the ladies on the benefit committee, who appeared from time to time to discuss the length of intermissions or the proper way to handle questions from the audience, the cooking team seemed calm and relaxed. On a television talk show two hours earlier, an interviewer had asked Julia whether it was necessary for her to be âquite so sloppyâ in the kitchen. It was a familiar question, often asked by television viewers who do not cook or who belong to what James Beard calls âthe sanitation school of cookery.â As Paul Child occasionally explains, when you are trying to cook a rather complicated dish in twenty-eight minutes on camera, you do not take time to wash the pots and scour the work spaces. Onstage at the Kabuki, at any rate, a great deal of work was getting done with a minimum of fuss.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who work with Julia Child are nearly always impressed by her sense of organization. âShe may look sort of slapdash on the screen, but sheâs the most organized person Iâve ever met,â according to Bess Hopkins, who now works in the office at WGBH. In the cluttered room that Julia uses as an office at home in Cambridge, her library of books on food and cooking and her extensive files of material on the subject are arranged and cross-referenced with the care and thoroughness of a major research institute, which, indeed, is what they amount to. A great deal of scholarship underlies that breezy self-assurance on camera; she can afford to appear casual, because she knows precisely what she is doing\n\n\n\nSome of her most ardent fans like to remember the slips and disasters of the early âFrench Chefâ shows: the potato pancake dropped on the counter and scooped back into the skillet with the serene advice that ânobodyâs lookingâ; the spilled liquids and solids; the famous Roast Suckling Pig that defied all Juliaâs efforts, with several knives, to carve it up. What her co-workers remember is Juliaâs incredible skill at averting disasters or turning them somehow to her advantage. âThe French Chefâ programs have all been videotaped in continuous half-hour shooting sessionsâa decision made at the beginning, because it avoided expensive editingâand only half a dozen times in more than two hundred programs taped so far has it been necessary to stop and reshoot. When a dessert began to lose its shape after unmolding on camera, Julia simply nudged it together with two spoons and urged her flock not to lose heart in similar situations. (âNever apologizeânobody knows what youâre aiming at, so just bring it to the table.â) When Ruth Lockwood, Juliaâs present producer and the person primarily responsible (with the Childs) for âThe French Chefâsâ style and format, forgot once to take the butter out of the refrigerator to soften before a taping, Julia improvised without a tremor: âWhereâs the butter? Oh, I forgot to take it out of the fridge! Well, hereâs what you do when that happens.â And that evening she called Ruth at home, because she knew how Ruth, who never forgot anything, would be feeling. Mrs. Lockwood says that in the twelve years she has worked with Julia they have never had a real dispute about anything. One of the few times anyone has seen Julia lose her temper, in fact, was one day when there was a fire on the set. A towel flared up, a pot holder caught fire, and the cameraman stopped shooting. Julia was furious. She wanted to show the viewers just what to do at home when this happened.\n\n\n\nPaul and Julia enjoy reminiscing about the early days of the show. They had come back from Norway in 1960âit had been Paulâs decision retire from the Foreign Service before he reached the compulsory retirement age of sixty-fiveâand established themselves in a comfortable old house they had bought several years before in Cambridge (the house where Josiah Royce, the philosopher, once lived). Paul planned to spend his time painting and photographing, and Julia was going to give private cooking lessons and work on Volume II of âMastering the Art of French Cooking.â In the spring of 1962, a few months after the first volume had been published, Julia was invited to appear on a literary-interview program on WGBH to talk about it. Thinking it might liven things up, she brought along a copper bowl and a wire whip, and showed the viewers how to beat up egg whites. WGBH received twenty-seven letters about the interview, all expressing delight. As Russell Morash, âThe French Chefâsâ first producer-director, put it recently, twenty-seven letters might not mean very much to a major network, but to a small, noncommercial station like WBGH it was impressive. Would Mrs. Child be willing to consider doing a pilot program for a possible series of cooking shows?\n\n\n\nThey made three pilot shows in June, 1962, using a basement display room of the Boston Gas Company in downtown Boston, because the WGBH studio had recently been destroyed by a fire. WGBHâs director of programming, Robert Larsen, liked the pilots so much that he was willing to put the stationâs own funds into financing a series of twenty-six shows. They went into production in January, 1963, in a makeshift set on the third floor of the Cambridge Electric Company, which had better parking facilities than Boston Gas. The early shows were all âremotes,â videotaped with two cameras connected by cables to a power source in WGBHâs mobile unit parked outside the building. They did four shows a week. Julia and Paul and Ruth Lockwood would spend all day Monday in the Childsâ big kitchen at home, drinking oceans of tea and blocking out the rough outlines, time sequences, and opening and closing lines for the weekâs programs. Tuesdays and Thursdays were rehearsal days, prior to tapings on Wednesdays and Fridays. Today, neither the Childs nor Mrs. Lockwood can imagine how they kept it up. Julia and Paul, who did all the shopping for the shows, would get to the Cambridge Electric Company an hour or so ahead of the others, carrying the Sacred Bag and a huge load of groceries. Whenever it snowed, Paul had to shovel the fire escape so the crew could bring in the cables and equipment. The crew numbered twenty-four, counting volunteers, and they usually ended up eating the show. Grips and cameramen would take home dishes in one state or another for their wives to finish cooking. The last show of the first series called for Lobster Ã  lâAmÃ©ricaine. Julia and Paul bought enough for everyone, and plenty of dry Riesling, and after the show they had a banquet on the set. Not a farewell banquet, because the second series was already in the works, with several âsubscribersâ (public television does not refer to âsponsorsâ), such as Safeway Stores, Hills Bros., and eventually the Polaroid Corporation, to help pay for it. They did sixty-eight shows at the Cambridge Electric Company before moving to the new WGBH studios, in Cambridge, in November, 1963.\n\n\n\nOld friends of Juliaâs often say that those early black-and-white shows were the bestâthat in spite of the mishaps, or perhaps because of them, Julia was more herself than she has appeared in the technically superior programs that followed. Julia, who is highly self-critical, does not agree at all. âI was inclined at the beginning, having been involved in writing and teaching, to be too expository, to talk too much,â she has said. âRuthie Lockwood kept reminding me that television was a visual medium and that the points had to be made visually. Also, I had no time sense to speak of, so it was very difficult for me at first. Weâve always worked with a system of âidiot cards,â which they hold up to tell me when itâs time to move on to the next step, but at the beginning Iâd sometimes forget to look for them. And then Iâd look at the wrong camera sometimes. The boys finally started putting a little hat on the camera that was shooting, and a big sign under the lens reading â*ME FRIEND*{: .small}.â â The videotapes of the first thirteen shows, which were made before the program started to be picked up by other noncommercial stations around the country, no longer existâthey literally wore out from overuse. Julia was rather pleased, because it gave her an opportunity to redo those programs (all basic mainstays such as Boeuf Bourguignonne, Coq au Vin, and omelettes) in a more professional manner. [#unhandled_cartoon] \n\n\n\nThe unique blend of Juliaâs earthy humor and European sophistication, her tendency to slap and sniff and taste everything without losing a shred of her dignity were there from the beginning. âJulia is a natural ham and a natural comic,â Paul once said, âand Ruth Lockwood, with her own slightly corny sense of humor, has always encouraged that in her.â Using a giant sabre to carve her Poulet SautÃ© Marengo, appearing in a pith helmet and firing off a popgun to bring down a squab for âSmall Roast Birds,â and other elements of horseplay have undoubtedly helped to build her audience, which seems, from the mail that comes in, to include a surprising number of children and husbands. Julia, moreover, is not above a little gentle baiting of her detractors, who tend to be mainly sanitationists (or âhome-economics types,â as Julia calls them), and those who are disturbed by her use of wine and other, more demonic spirits in cooking. âNow weâll add a quarter of a teaspoon of white wine,â she will say, pouring copiously from the bottle. âThe children will love it.â An amazing number of people seem to think that Juliaâs high good humor and her occasional mishaps on the home screen can mean only that she is drunk. Cartoons have depicted her swigging from a bottle as she cooks, and some viewers insist that they have actually seen her do this on cameraâa misapprehension that may stem, Julia thinks, from the time she carefully peeled, seeded, and squeezed a tomato and then drank off the juice in a cup. When the BBC was contemplating a âFrench Chefâ series in Britain, the program that they put on the air to test audience reaction opened with Julia picking up the lids from two steaming saucepans and clashing them together like cymbals. This caused the steam lingering in both lids to fly right into her face, a painful surprise that she accepted with one of her more robust peals of laughter. The station received so many calls from distressed Britons wondering what on earth a drunken or demented American woman was doing on the Third Programme that the BBC decided not to run the series after all. Actually, as Paul sometimes points out, it is peculiar to assume that anything as complex as what Julia does on televisionâdoes with split-second timing and with explanations that make senseâcould be done at all by someone under the influence of liquor. âShe wouldnât be dropping spoons up there, sheâd be falling down,â Paul says. It may be that real spontaneity has become so rare that it requires an explanation. âWe never really know what sheâs going to say on the program,â Ruth Lockwood said recently. âShe memorizes the opening and closing lines, and there is a sort of rough script, consisting mostly of key words and phrases, but aside from that thereâs just no telling whatâs going to happen. We always say itâs the only real suspense show on television.â\n\n\n\nThe last show in âThe French Chefâ series was taped in December, 1972. There are more than two hundred of them on tape, and reruns keep the program going in most parts of the country, but after twelve years the Childs are not sure they want to continue with it. âIf I ever do any more, I want them to be more professional,â Julia said recently. âI want to be sure that the closeups are correct, and things like that. One time, we had a program on roasting a turkey, and at the end you couldnât see the turkey being carved, couldnât see a damn thing.â She would like to be able to edit the show after each taping, though editing would add considerably to the expense. Julia thinks of herself primarily as a teacherââ âThe French Chef,â â she says, âis really a continuation of LâÃcole des Trois Gourmandesââand she feels that her students should not have to put up with anything less than the highest standards.\n\n\n\nIt has been said that Julia Child really âmadeâ public television. She was certainly the first major star to emerge from noncommercial programmingâthe first to become a nationally known figure. Wherever she goes now, people recognize her and speak to her; in restaurants, waiters ask her to sign the menu (which pleases her enormously), and other diners send over friendly notes and try to find out what she has ordered. A recent television commercial featured Julia Chicken, a fowl who spoke in the French Chefâs unmistakably rich and breathy accents, until the Childsâ lawyer put a stop to it, and âThe Electric Company,â a childrenâs program, has had a character named Julia Grownup. Although Julia Child has little time to savor the fruits of her fame, she clearly enjoys itââloves every minute of it,â according to Avis DeVotoâand, just as clearly, will not miss it when it recedes. She has consistently turned down all offers from commercial TV, just as she has turned down all requests to endorse products or to lend her name to promotions other than those in support of public television. Last year, she was approached by NBC, which offered her a spot at nine-thirty in the morning five days a week; she turned it down, largely because the audience at that hour would be almost entirely women, âand our audience is bigger than that.â She has given back to WGBH, through fees for demonstrations, fund-raising appeals, and royalties from âThe French Chef Cookbook,â far more than she has ever received from it. The Childs feel that her television exposure has been responsible in large part for the success of âMastering the Art of French Cooking,â and that alone has made them, if not rich, at least comfortable beyond anything they had ever expected. Everyone involved, it appears, is grateful to everyone else, and the television audience seems happy enough for the time being with reruns. There has been talk about presenting âThe French Chefâ in a new format, based on public cooking demonstrations like the ones in San Francisco. But at present, Juliaâs only plans for television involve a few special shows with James Beard.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Julia has completed the manuscript of another cookbook, using recipes done on the show since the first one appeared, in 1968, and she and Simone Beck may do a revised edition of âMastering the Art of French Cooking.â Louisette Bertholle, who dropped out of the collaboration after Volume I, now lives near Bourges and is teaching and writing on her own. But the Childs and Mme. Beck and her husband, Jean Fischbacher, a perfumer, remain in close contact professionally and personallyâparticularly during the spring and summer, when the Childs stay in a little house they have built on some property of the Fischbachersâ in the South of France. One purpose of a revision would be to bring readers up to date on some of the culinary equipment that has come along in recent years (such as nonstick pans and highly versatile electrical processors). In Volume I, the authors took a somewhat Olympian tone about utensils, in line with the traditional _hauteur du chef,_ but Julia has come to feel that it is a good thing to speed matters up where possible in the kitchen, and that if the same effect that used to be produced by laborious handwork can be duplicated by a machine, then _vive la machine_.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAn hour before the first San Francisco cooking demonstration was to start, at two on Monday afternoon, the Childs and their two assistants were finishing a leisurely lunch in a curtained-off area at the left side of the stage. These âworkingâ lunches were relatively simple but far from casual occasions. During the preceding days Rosie Manell had dished up many regional specialties, such as cracked crab, tiny bay shrimps, rex sole, and abalone (sautÃ©ed twenty seconds to a side, no more), each of which had been complemented by a chilled Muscadet or some other wine from the Liberty House boutique in the theatre lobby. Each meal began with a ritual _carillon de lâamitiÃ©,_ the four wineglasses held carefully by the stems so the sound would ring out clearly. âOne of the good things about getting to be sixty,â Julia said that Monday, âis that you make up your mind not to drink any more rotgut wine.â There was a great deal of laughter and much talk of food. âWhen a vegetable is as beautiful as this asparagus,â Rosie Manell said at one point, âyouâve just got to take it seriouslyââa comment that Julia liked so much she repeated it to her audience a little later. Immediately following lunch, while the others made a final check of the dozens of items that would be used during the afternoonâs demonstration, Julia was left alone in the dining alcove for her âquiet time,â which she used to go over her notes. She showed not the slightest hint of nervousness or stage fright.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe demonstration was twenty minutes late getting started. Heavy rains had slowed traffic, but when Julia came out from the wings the downstairs area of the Kabuki was filled nearly to capacity, the audience consisting mostly of well-dressed women, who greeted her enthusiastically. Julia introduced her âteamâ: Rosie Manell and Liz Bishop, who would be onstage throughout the performance, and Paul, âour general manager, timekeeper, and resident ogre,â sitting at a table in the front row, where he could give time signals and make suggestions to the performers. The program called for soufflÃ© on a platter, with poached eggs; Caneton en Aspic Ã  la Parisienne; and Charlotte Malakoff. âNobody in their right mind would want to serve all three at the same meal,â Julia explained, âbut each could be the centerpiece of a memorable meal. Now, then, where are my glasses?â\n\n\n\nThe difference between Julia on television and Julia live onstage is mainly a difference in timing. Without the minute-to-minute pressure and the time cards held up to tell her to move on, she can be a little more expansive, and better able to savor the amusement and delight of whatever she happens to be doing. Volunteer hostesses in stylish aprons, instructed by the benefit committee to bring portable microphones to anyone who wanted to ask a question, never did so, because nobody needed them; when someone had a question, she would ask it, and Julia would glance up from her work, grin, and answer while continuing to work. She was in her kitchen and about eight hundred people were there with her. âI know what it is about her,â an attractive San Franciscan said during the intermission. âSheâs just like a child playing. Anybody who has that much fun just has to be irresistible.â\n\n\n\nJuliaâs explanations of what she was doing and why were interspersed with items of general information. French ducks, she observed, tended to be less fatty than American ducks, which made them better for Caneton en Aspic. Raffle tickets would be sold during intermission for all the food cooked onstage, including the duck bones, which could be used for stock. (âJust think, somebodyâs going to win all these lovely duck bones.â) If you wanted to, you could use âthe other spreadâ in the soufflÃ©, but it wouldnât taste as good as it did with butter. âBut then who am I to tell you what to use?â she went on. âItâs the method that counts, really. You can substitute any ingredients you want.â That morning, Rosie and Liz had cleaned out the local Safewayâs entire stock of sweet butterâthirty pounds, which they would use up before the week was out. Nobody catches Julia Child using the other spread.\n\n\n\nâAll this looks a little terrible until you get it done,â she noted in passing.\n\n\n\nâLetâs just taste and see if itâs any good,â she said a little later, dipping a spoon into the just blended duck mousse. She tasted, paused, cast her eyes upward. âItâs pretty good,â she said, adding a touch more cognac. Another taste, and a nod of the head. âI think,â she said, patting the cognac bottle, âthat thatâs what makes the difference between an American meat loaf and a French pÃ¢tÃ©, donât you?â\n\n\n\nRosie and Liz moved in and out of the work space, helping where needed. Julia chatted with them and with the audience. From his seat out front, Paul occasionally offered a suggestion, telling Julia, for example, to move to the right or the left so the overhead television cameras could pick up what she was doing and relay it to the screens on either side. âThey canât see what youâre doing, J.C.,â Paul would say. âHold up the pan.â [#unhandled_cartoon] \n\n\n\nJames Beard spoke recently of the âall-embracing qualityâ that draws people to Julia Child. âShe has the kind of bigness that all great artists have,â he said. âSingers especially. She just sweeps everyone up and carries them away. I think she could run for political office and do very well.â The choreographer Merce Cunningham, a great fan of Juliaâs program, has observed that she moves like a dancer. âEverything is direct and clearâno superfluous gestures,â Cunningham said. âThat must be how she gets through all that complicated business within the time limit, and itâs one reason sheâs so fascinating to watch.â She is also very good at building to a dramatic climax.\n\n\n\nThe Charlotte Malakoff provided the climax of the first dayâs demonstrations. Instead of serving the velvety almond-cream dessert (flavored with chocolate and rum) molded in homemade ladyfingers, as the printed program had said she would, Julia decided to serve it in a cage of spun caramel. Donning a thick red rubber glove from the Sacred Bag to keep from burning her hand, she took a small cake pan, held it upside down, carefully buttered the exterior surface, then set to work covering it with molten caramel dripped from a spoon. The skeins of caramel glittered in the stage lights. It took several minutes for her to cover the pan. She let it cool, then carefully began to work the caramel loose, chatting the while about the need for patience in cooking. After a tense interval, the caramel slid free, and she held up a gossamer cage. Applause from the audience. âDonât clap yet,â Julia warned. She thought the cage needed fixing in a couple of spots, so she slipped it back over the bottom of the cake pan and added more hot caramel. âAnything you spill you can turn into taffy,â she said. Again the cage was delicately pried loose from the pan. Julia started to hold it up for all to see, and in doing so dropped it. Gasps and groans from the audience; the cage was in smithereens. Julia put her head back and laughed. âWeâll just have to do it all over again,â she said, and did it all over again, successfully, to thunderous applause.\n\n\n\nThe same thing happened at the second performance, that evening, except that she broke the cage when she went to put it in the freezer. âNever give up!â she cried. âThis is a fine illustration of not getting discouraged.â The, audience, which this time included a substantial number of men, was limp with delight. Fifty or more people stayed on after the show to stand in line and have their copies of âMastering the Art of French Cookingâ autographed by Julia and Paul, and nearly all of them wanted to talk with the Childs, to say something about what Julia had meant in their lives and how grateful they were. Julia asked questions about each personâs home or family or kitchen. They were signing autographs until after midnight.\n\n\n\nLater, back at the hotel, the team gathered in the Childsâ suite for a nightcap. They had ridden up in the elevator with Rudolf Nureyev, who was in town with the National Ballet of Canada and was staying at the same hotel; the two âsuperstars,â as Herb Caen referred to them in his column in the _Chronicle_, rode up together silently, without a sign of recognition, but afterward Julia commented with interest on Nureyevâs costume, which consisted of knee-length snakeskin boots and a snakeskin shirt. It looked, Liz Bishop said, as though the snake were eating him. The conversation in the suite flowed without effort. Julia and Paul talked about Norway, which they had both adored. They liked the Norwegians and their way of life, they liked the countryside, and they even liked, in moderation, the food. âYou have to learn how to order there,â Julia said. âTheir poached sea trout is delicious. The fried food is awful. And their idea of vegetables is four kinds of potato and some parsley.â Julia learned more Norwegian than Paul did, because Paul was too busy at the Embassy to give full attention to lessons. Julia has been known to sing the Norwegian national anthem at parties, her great, plummy voice swooping up and down the scale with utter confidence, though in no discernible key.\n\n\n\nBefore going to bed, they talked a little about the various groups, mainly in California, that were now dedicating themselves to mysticism, psychic experimentation, and the transformation of consciousness. Julia didnât seem to know much about the new consciousness, but she thought it sounded interesting. âI just hope,â she said at one point, âthat good food is a part of it.âÂ â¦","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/12/23/good-cooking","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e3da97f12ef91609f2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Calvin Tomkins has been a staff writer forÂ *The New Yorker* since 1960.

America from New York. They\nwere on their way to Paris: Paul Child, a career civil servant, had been\noffered a job as an exhibits officer for the United States Information\nService, a now defunct division of the State Department. Their baggage\nincluded a Buick station wagon, nicknamed âThe Blue Flash.â They packed\nthemselves into the car and drove south to Rouen, where Julia Child ate\nher first French meal, at La Couronne, then the oldest restaurant in\nFrance. Paul ordered the meal: oysters, followed by *sole meuniÃ¨re,* *salade verte*, wine, *fromage blanc*, and black coffee. Julia Child\nwould later say, âIt was the most important meal of my life.â From then\non, she was all in.\n\nâ[France is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child](https://www.amazon.com/France-Feast-Photographic-Journey-Julia/dp/0500519072)â is a labor of love, about a love affair. The text is written by Julia\nChildâs nephew, Alex Prudâhomme, with whom she collaborated on her\nautobiography, âMy Life in France.â Katie Pratt, a photography curator\nwhose parents were close friends of the Childs, is the co-author. Almost\nevery day during their years in France, Julia and Paul Child took an\nafternoon walk: these tender, exacting black-and-white photographs are a\nrecord, mainly, of those perambulations, first in Paris and then in\nMarseille, where Paul was stationed in 1953.\n\nThe photographs fall roughly into two categories. The first show Paul\nChildâs attention to pattern and detail, a skill that he used during the\nwar, when he was posted at the Office of Strategic Services in Kandy,\nCeylon, now Sri Lanka (among his tasks was making maps of enemy\nmovements and charts of potentially poisonous plants). Two facing\npictures in â[France is a Feast](http://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/france-is-a-feast-the-photographic-journey-of-paul-and-julia-child-hardcover)â underscore his lapidary eye: on the left\nside of the page, cornhusks hang like stalactites from the eaves of a\nbarn; on the right, in a second photograph, the cornhusk fractals are\ninverted and held by the spiny bare branches of a winter vineyard. Paul\nwrote obsessively to his twin brother, Charles, a painter, over the\ncourse of his life (Charles replied less frequently). In one letter,\nPaul describes how he is entranced by reflections and doubling. The\nphotographer Edward Steichen, whom the Childs befriended in Paris, had\nadvised Paul to limit his work to one subject. For a time, he tried\nthis, labelling his efforts âAll Sorts of Things Reflected in\nSomething.â In this quest, Paul photographed a set of shiny copper pans\nin the cramped kitchen of their flat in Paris, on Rue de lâUniversitÃ©,\n(an address the Childs dubbed the âRoo de Looâ); a portrait of their\nhousekeeper, âJeanne-la-Folle,â polishing a mirror; the Pont Neuf\nreflected in the Seine.\n\nThe second category, and the endless sun of these photographs, is Julia.\nHe canât keep his eyes off her. A contact sheet of Juliaâs long legs,\npropped up in a telephone booth; her open, ruddy face as she arranges a\npicnic in a newly mown field; Julia sunbathing with a friend on a Paris\nrooftop; a nude portrait, silhouetted against a closed curtain in a\nhotel room. Weâre so accustomed to Julia Child the ample lioness,\nhooting over a slippery chicken, that itâs a shock to see her gamine,\ngawky as a gazelle in her early days in Paris. In one of the most\nbeautiful photographs collected here, sheâs standing on a hillside in\nLes Baux-de-Provence, arms akimbo, the curve of her stance echoed in the\nbranches of the nearby pine trees. Sheâs thirty-six. Itâs before\nbooksâbefore the thousand-page manuscript that became âMastering the Art\nof French Cookingââbefore cooking on television, before fame. Sheâs\nlaughing. She looks like a woman with an appetite.\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/5a1f0c1c5214435865e9b653]||||||\n\nPaul Child and Julia McWilliams met in 1944, in Kandy, where they were\nboth stationed in the Office of Strategic Services. (Julia had joined\nthe O.S.S. at the onset of the war and was first stationed in\nWashington; under the regulations of the time, her height had prohibited\nher from joining the Womenâs Army Corps. She was six foot two.) Paul,\nwho was forty-two, was assigned to the âVisual Presentation\nDivisionââhis work included the design for a secret war room for\nMountbatten. (Other members of his office team included the architect\nEero Saarinen and the journalist Theodore White.) Child, a man with a\nsmall mustache and wire-rimmed glasses, who looked like Garth Williamsâs\ndrawings for âStuart Little,â was born in Montclair, New Jersey, in\n1902. His father died when he and Charles were six months old, and the\nfamily moved to Boston, to be near his motherâs family. He attended the\nBoston Latin School, and spent two years at Columbia, before dropping\nout because of financial constraints. He found reading and world travel\nto be suitable educators. His escapades, as he recounted\nthemâclimbing a mast in a lightning storm, shipping out on an oil\ntankerâread as the dogged efforts of a fearful man who has set out to\nprove himself. He could draw and paint, and tried living in Paris, but\neventually took a job at a boarding school in the Dordogne. Back in New\nEngland, he taught first at the Shady Hill School, in Cambridge, and\nthen at Avon Old Farms School, in Connecticut. Along the way, he fell in\nlove with the mother of one of his students, twenty years his senior,\nwith whom he lived for ten years. Her death devastated him. From Kandy,\nhe wrote to Charles, âWhen am I going to meet a grown-up dame with\nbeauty, character, sophistication, and sensibility?â\n\nJulia McWilliams had a desk in the next office. A clerk-typist, she was\nalso sometimes assigned to secret projectsâamong these was her first\nrecorded recipe, for a shark repellant. Writing to his brother, Paul\ncriticized her âsloppy thinking,â but admired her âcrazy sense of\nhumor.â They became friends, visiting local food markets, and taking a\nride on an elephant. In later years, he recalled, âIt wasnât like\nlightning striking the barn on fire. I just began to think, my God, this\nis a hell of a nice woman.â She described herself as âa rather loud and\nunformed social butterfly.â Julia, born in Pasadena in 1912, was ten\nyears younger than Paul. Her mother, Carolyn, an heir to the New England\nWeston Paper fortune, had died in 1937. Her father, John, a wealthy\nCalifornia landowner, disapproved of the marriage to an Eastern aesthete\nwith few prospects. It was Juliaâs own money, inherited from her mother,\nthat cushioned Paul Childâs civil-service salaryâand all that eating out.\n\nI first met Julia Child in 2001, but she had loomed large as a feature\nof my life. My motherâs *boeuf bourguignon,* coq au vin, onion soup,\nand chocolate mousse were painstakingly produced by paying careful\nattention to the creased pages of her copy of âMastering the Art of\nFrench Cooking,â which had been published in 1961. In my early twenties,\nI lived in a ramshackle apartment a few blocks from the Childsâ big\nhouse, on Francis Avenue in Cambridge. There was an opening in the\nclapboard fence. One spring, I peered through and saw a lawn covered in\nbluebells. In 2001, when an editor asked me if Iâd like to interview\nJulia Child on the fortieth anniversary of âMastering the Art of French\nCooking,â I jumped at the chance, but, once I was on the train to\nBoston, I panicked. What more could Julia Child possibly have to say?\nPlenty, it turned out. We spent the afternoon in her kitchen. She made\nlunchâan *omelette aux fine herbes* and a *salade verte*. Paul Child had\ndied in 1994, after a long decline. She had just reread âPÃ¨re Goriot,â\nand she was thinking about old age. â âAll happiness depends on courage\nand work.â Thatâs Balzac for you,â she said, taking a bite of her\nomelette. Like Paul Child, and like Balzac, Julia liked method and\norder. She told me, âSome people like to build boats in the basement, I\nlike to do things to food.â Watching, rapt, as she made mayonnaise for\nour salad, I mentioned that mayonnaise had always evaded me. She wrapped\nan apron around my waist, put a bowl in front of me, and said, âLetâs\nsee whatâs the trouble.â\n\nTurning these pages, and reading the meandering text (leafing through\nthe book is a little like looking at a scrapbook while someone tells\nstories; you ask, now and then, âWait, was that *before* or *after* the\nwar?â), I found myself thinking of another group of photographs: Alfred\nStieglitzâs pictures of Georgia OâKeeffe, which I first saw at the Met,\nin 1978. I was home from college for Thanksgiving break, on the verge of\na broken heart. What would it be like, I thought, to be a woman who\naccomplished things but was also beloved? It was something to do with\nseeing and being seen, I thought, but I didnât know what, yet. Decades\nlater, when story after story tells us what we already knowâthat too\noften being seen equals being hurtâitâs extraordinary to see a\ncollection of photographs in which a fiercely talented and accomplished\nwoman is presented with humor, admiration, and love.\n\nAs Prudâhomme notes in the book, Julia Child arrived in France as Eliza\nDoolittle to her husbandâs Henry Higgins; it was Paul, on that first\nafternoon in Rouen, who introduced her to that most intimate of\nlanguages, gastronomy. For Paul, she was both artist and muse. From an\nEliza exclaiming over beurre blanc (she called it âwonder-sauceâ), Julia\nbecame Paulâs Margalo, the beautiful bird whom Stuart Little loves and\nprotects, and whom he follows to places unknown. Julia called Paul âthe\nman who is always thereâporter, dishwasher, official photographer,\nmushroom dicer and onion chopper, editor, fish illustrator, manager,\ntaster, idea man, resident poet, and husband.â He took pictures at every\nturn, leaving a record of the streets of Paris and Marseille, of his\nwife, and of his own ghostly, beloved presence, reflecting the light that she\ncast.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5907ef03c14b3c606c102767","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Photo Booth","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"photo-booth"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8864e65be2f29d55ea1","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/cynthia-zarin","email":"","name":"Cynthia Zarin","socialMedia":[],"title":"Cynthia Zarin has been a regular contributor to The New Yorker since 1983.

At first, the unremitting artificiality of the place seems merely novel. You ascend from the spotless 7-train platform, push through turnstiles branded with Neiman Marcus advertising, and emerge onto a plaza that bears the same relation to New York City as a police-sketch artistâs drawing does to a face. Someone has heard of the city that Hudson Yards is nominally part of; there is an honest-to-God hot-dog vender to prove it, and handsome, undulating benches to sit on as you admire the landscaping and breathe in the river air. But you have not come to Hudson Yards to eat hot dogs and sit on benches. You are there to climb the Vessel, [Thomas Heatherwick](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/26/thomas-heatherwick-architectures-showman)âs shawarma-shaped stairway to nowhere, and to wander the seven-story, seven-hundred-and-twenty-thousand-square-foot mall, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox. Its interiors, by Elkus Manfredi, are sleek and opulent; the stores and restaurants gleam. Hours slip by. Your sips of the scented, trapped air are growing shallow. The piped-in music has begun to replace your inner monologue. You long to see a pigeon, to smell sun-baked urine, to gaze at the sun itself. You need to leave. You race outside and run south, where you are spat out onto the High Line, beneath mammoth condo-side advertisements for âluxe livingâ in âresidences.â Are those like apartments? you wonder, as a squadron of selfie-takers sweeps by, pelting you in the stomach with glossy shopping bags: fade, expensively, to black.\n\nHudson Yards is built to impress, and, by some criteria, it does. Thereâs the sheer scale of its five glass towers, which house offices and, yes, âresidences,â and pierce the New York City sky like so many porcupine quills; next year, an observation deck will open, eleven hundred feet in the air. Maybe some public good will come of the Shed, the two-hundred-thousand-square-foot arts space that is scheduled to open next month. The buffed metals, polished stones, and Apple Store-esque glass faÃ§ades that decorate the mallâs interior are meant to telegraph tastefully deployed wealth, and this they do to perfection. Thereâs food of the star-chef variety, much of it astronomically pricedâor ostentatiously [not priced](https://ny.eater.com/2019/3/22/18276275/estiatorio-milos-hudson-yards-prices-nyc-restaurant), as the case may beâand fancy tech: a truck-less garbage-disposal system that sounds like Willy Wonkaâs chocolate chute; generators designed to withstand inevitable natural catastrophe. Speaking of natural catastrophe, the entire development is built on a platform over the cityâs rail yards and outfitted with various locking and sealing mechanisms that are designed to keep the elevators functioning and the lights on, even when the big waves come. Hudson Yards is a ship that canât be sunk. (Where have we heard *that* before?) As the rest of us are washed out to sea, we can take comfort in the thought of the lucky Noahs left behind to propagate the species in their gleaming arc.\n\nBut letâs stay in the here and now. As is increasingly common in New York City, Hudson Yards is a private space masquerading as a public one. It is the realized vision of one man, the developer Stephen Ross, the founder and chairman of Related Companies, who brought us the Time Warner Center a decade and a half ago. Ross, who will soon move into a penthouse at the development, calls his creation a neighborhoodââthe neighborhood of the future,â in his companyâs advertising lingo. In reality it is an enclave, a high-end corporate park buoyed by six billion dollars in [tax breaks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/nyregion/hudson-yards-new-york-tax-breaks.html)âan amount that dwarfs the subsidies offered to Amazon for [its scuttled Queens headquarters](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/new-york-city-activists-drive-out-amazon)âand designed as a kind of amenity-stuffed Hotel California that its residents never have to leave. (There are a limited number of so-called affordable units; in keeping with precedent in our cityâs age of latter-day luxury, the people who live in them will have separate amenities, upstairs/downstairs style.) The only thing that Hudson Yards is missing is its own weather.\n\nYes, the rest of us can visit, but why would we? For all the hullabaloo and the expenseâthe two are indistinguishableâthereâs not much at Hudson Yards that canât be found elsewhere. The mall is a case in point. Sephora, H&M, Zara, Madewell, even Van Cleef & Arpels and Dior, if thatâs your thing: Why trek halfway to New Jersey for it when it can already be had in Manhattan? Related has stirred up some effortful buzz around the mallâs Neiman Marcus branch, the cityâs first, as if it were a giant panda and Manhattan a zoo. When I stopped by, earlier this week, stylish teen-agers were posing for pictures in front of the trunk half of a yellow cab, filled with dahlias, that had been planted in the storeâs entryway. This is what used to be called a photo op and is now called an âexperience.â Either way, no quantity of selfies is going to stave off the collapse of traditional brick-and-mortar retail; a few years ago, when the industry was looking really grim, Neiman Marcus nearly pulled out of the development altogether, causing something of a panic at Related.\n\nIn that sense, Hudson Yards *is* a neighborhood of the futureâthe future that was imagined way back in the Bloomberg administration, when turning the city into a landing pad for the international super-rich was made top priority and sold as a twisted survival strategy. That vision of luxury is all about a frictionless sameness: being able to do and eat and buy the same things, in the same kinds of settings, to the tune of the same ambient music, no matter where on the globe one may be. Itâs no wonder that what Hudson Yards really feels like is a nice airport terminal, with the High Line as its moving walkway. (The High Line, which once seemed like a triumph of urban reimagination, now seems to me the embodiment of this narcotic nowhere-ness: a beautiful highway that has sliced through a living neighborhood, Robert Moses style, leaving luxury buildings in its wake.)\n\nThere is one thing at Hudson Yards that canât be found anywhere else: the Vessel, with its twenty-five hundred steps, eighty landings, and hundred and fifty flights of stairs. It was commissioned by Ross to provide an eye-catching center to his corporate kingdom, the rug that ties the room together, and it is perfect for its environment: a triumph of vapidity, banal to its hollow core. In the run-up to its opening, some clever marketing team got critics to start asking if it might be New Yorkâs new Eiffel Tower. Itâs a laughable comparison. The Eiffel Tower was daring, original, most of all a shock; it changed the way that the city of Paris looks, and the way that Parisians look at their city. Meanwhile, the Vesselâits name is apparently subject to change, so make your suggestions nowâis simply a means by which to look, again, at oneself: a calorie-burning selfie backdrop that is far more attractive in photos than it is in person, where its reflective, rose-gold exterior has already started to smudge. The other day, a group of people was standing inside the thing at ground level, grinning over a glowing disk placed at the center of the floor. They were taking timed selfies: a face, tinged with blue light, framed by the void. (There was a to-do, last week, when it was [discovered](https://ny.curbed.com/2019/3/21/18275790/hudson-yards-vessel-photo-policy-social-media) that the terms and conditions that must be signed in exchange for Vessel tickets granted Hudson Yards the rights to any images or recordings made of it, in perpetuity. The language is, apparently, being changed.) The experience of climbing the Vessel will feel familiar to anyone who has looked, in frustration, for her seat in a sports stadium. The higher you go, the more you can see of the mall, leering at you from different angles. The Vessel does produce one beautiful view, though, of the glinting, silver tops of the trains in the yards below, encased in their tracks like gifts. Soon they, too, will be covered by a platform and planted over with more towers, a suppressed memory of something useful, time-worn, real.\n\n*A previous version of this post misstated the height of the observation deck and the size of the arts center the Shed.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1dd281ab3335f580f2b2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1dd281ab3335f580f2b2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hudson Yards","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hudson-yards"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Hudson Yards","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"hudson-yards"},{"id":"5c2e1ce5397f5b30646d0689","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ce5397f5b30646d0689","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Real Estate","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"real-estate"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Real Estate","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"real-estate"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef00ebe912338a37171f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907ef00ebe912338a37171f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cultural Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cultural-comment"},{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Cultural Comment","parent":[{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"cultural-comment"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a03fc019dfc3494ea4180","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Alexandra Schwartz has been a a staff writer atÂ *The New Yorker* since 2016.

Something about the body in motion limbers up the mind and suggests that it should get moving, too. When she is working on a book, she exists in a state of heightened suggestibility, as if everything she sees and hears were hers for the taking. In her twenties, when she went to journalism school to learn how to make radio documentaries, she loved spending hours with audiotape, a razor blade, and chalk, seamlessly stitching together the voices she had gathered, trying to keep her own voice out of the mix. But she found that she wished she could embellish, add thunder and lightning where there had been only a gentle rain, and that is why she writes fiction.\n\nA few years ago, Toews was walking around Toronto, where she lives, turning the idea for a novel over in her mind. She had been thinking about it on and off since 2009, when she read about a series of crimes that had taken place in a remote Mennonite community in Bolivia known as Manitoba Colony. Mennonites belong to an Anabaptist movement that took shape in the Netherlands during the Protestant Reformation. Today, they number about two million worldwide. Though most now live modern lives, they, like the Amish, have traditionally kept themselves at a strict remove from the sinful world, and some still do. Members of Manitoba Colony arenât on the electrical grid. They make their living from farming, but they put steel rather than rubber on the wheels of their tractors, since rubber tires, which move faster, are forbidden. Their first language is Plautdietsch, or Low German, an archaic unwritten dialect that dates back to sixteenth-century Polish Prussia, where many of their ancestors settled after persecution drove them from home. After Prussia, they went to Russia, then to Canada, and then to Mexico and points south, not intermarrying with the local population, leaving each place when its laws or customs impinged on their commitment to separation.\n\nToews learned that between 2005 and 2009 more than a hundred women and girls in Manitoba Colony had been raped at night in their homes. It took some time for them to understand what was happening, because they had almost no memory of the assaults; they would wake in the morning in pain, bruised, with blood in their beds. Some colonists said that the women were being [attacked by demons](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4w7gqj/the-ghost-rapes-of-bolivia-000300-v20n8) sent to punish them for their sins. They were suspected of lying to disguise adultery. Then, one night, two men from the colony were caught trying to enter a house. Along with six others, they were convicted of the attacks. They had sedated their victims by spraying them with a cow anesthetic made from belladonna.\n\nToews, who is fifty-four, is one of the best-known and best-loved Canadian writers of her generation. She grew up in Steinbach, a town founded by Mennonites in the province of Manitoba, for which the colony in Bolivia was named. (âToews,â which rhymes with âsaves,â is as recognizably Mennonite as âCohenâ is Jewish.) Her fiction has often dealt with the religious hypocrisy and patriarchal dominion that she feels to be part of her heritage, and with a painful emotional legacy, harder to name but as present as a watermark. Her father and her sister both died too young, and she sees a certain Mennonite tendency toward sorrow and earthly guilt as bearing some responsibility for their deaths. On the other hand, she and her mother are still alive. But for the vagaries of history, Toews thinks, they could have been like the women of the other Manitoba.\n\nShe had no interest in describing the crimes. She tried to imagine how the women might have responded when they learned the truth, but her own emotions kept breaking in. She craved revenge. She wanted the women to make the men of the colony feel fear in their bones, fear of being attacked, of being killed, of being tortured or egregiously violated. Maybe they could use the belladonna to knock out the men and commit brutalâbrutal what? The idea seemed hokey, not to mention absurd. Mennonites are pacifists; one reason they have moved so often throughout their history is to avoid being conscripted as soldiers. No matter what had happened to the women, she knew, they werenât like her. They would keep their faith.\n\nHer characters began to speak to her, almost as a chorus. She chose to let them address one another instead, to ask the questions she had and see if answers would come. The women are eight members from three generations of two closely connected families, the Friesens and the Loewens: mothers and daughters, grandmothers and granddaughters, aunts and nieces, cousins. She put them together in a barn loft. Their attackers have been jailed, but the other men of the colony have gone to post bail. The women have two days to decide what to do:\n\n> Greta explains that these horses, upon being startled by Dueckâs stupid dog, donât organize meetings to determine their next course of action. They run. And by so doing, evade the dog and potential harm.\n>\n> Agata Friesen, the eldest of the Friesen women (although born a Loewen) laughs, as she does frequently and charmingly, and agrees. But Greta, she states, we are not animals.\n>\n> Greta replies that we have been preyed upon like animals; perhaps we should respond in kind.\n>\n> Do you mean we should run away? asks Ona.\n>\n> Or kill our attackers? asks Salome.\n>\n> (Mariche, Gretaâs eldest, until now silent, makes a soft scoffing sound.)\n\nThe women argue with and shout at one another, and joke and laugh. They think about salvation, freedom, safety. When they need a break, they sing hymns. The teen-agers in the barn goof off, braiding their hair together and miming killing themselves from boredom. Their choices are to do nothing, to stay and fight the men for a more equal position in the colony, or to leave. The colonyâs bishop has asked them to forgive their attackers. If they donât, he says, they will be just as guilty in the eyes of God. They have two lives to consider: the one that they are living on earth and the eternal one that they hope to spend in Heaven.\n\nToews called the book, her eighth, â[Women Talking](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Talking-Miriam-Toews/dp/1635572584).â It was released in Canada last year, and will be published in the U.S., by Bloomsbury, next month. She likes the declarative simplicity of the title. When people tell her they are surprised to find that her novel mostly just consists of women talking to one another, she thinks, Yeah, well, I warned you. Once, after a foreign publisher turned down one of her novels owing to âa fatal lack of plot,â she suggested that the phrase be used as a cover blurb. In place of plot, she creates pressure, steadily intensifying the novelâs atmospheric conditions until it becomes clear that something must either collapse or explode.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn a slushy, treacherous January afternoon, Toews was sitting on her living-room rug, holding her grinning six-month-old grandson, Austin, in her lap. The house, a narrow Victorian in Torontoâs Queen West neighborhood, was in a comfortable disarray of throw pillows and baby toys. Toews was young when she had her childrenâGeorgia, who is Austinâs mother, and Owen, whose daughter, Silvia, had just turned oneâand she has become a devoted grandmother, eager to babysit. âI loved being a mother,â she said. âI _am_ a mother, but I mean raising children. I know that sounds so retrograde and bullshit, but itâs true.â\n\nToewsâs own mother, Elvira, faced them in a recliner, holding a pile of books on Mennonite history, their covers illustrated with bonneted, wide-skirted women and men straining at hand plows. âWeâre all interrelated,â she said. âLiterally. Letâs see, how am I related to you, Miriam? Sheâs my daughter, for one thing.â\n\nâBut my parents were second cousins,â Toews said.\n\nâHer father and I were second cousins, so Miriam and I are second cousins once removed!â\n\nâOh, thatâs gross,â Toews said. Her Canadian âOâs are as round as frying pans, her voice musical and even. âI never even thought of that.â\n\nShe pulled her straw-blond hair into a loose bun, out of the babyâs reach. Toews is Russian Mennonite, a slight misnomer; her Frisian ancestors arrived in Canada by way of Russia, but they did not intermarry, and it is easy to imagine coming across her pale oval face, with its sharp nose and light, frank eyes, in a Dutch portrait gallery. A decade and a half ago, on the strength of her author photo, the director Carlos Reygadas cast her as the beautiful, spurned wife of a farmer in his film â[Silent Light](https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Light-Cornelio-Wall/dp/B002C8YSDI),â set in a conservative Mennonite colony in Mexico. Most of her role involved stoically suffering in long, wordless closeups; the scant dialogue was in Plautdietsch, her parentsâ first language, which she does not really speak, so she learned her lines phonetically.\n\nThere is a Plautdietsch term, _schputting_, for irreverence directed at serious or sacred things. In conversation, as in art, Toews is a _schputter;_ she likes to puncture anything that has a whiff of pretension or self-importance about it. A few years after her experience in âSilent Light,â she wrote a novel, â[Irma Voth](https://www.amazon.com/Irma-Voth-Novel-Miriam-Toews/dp/0062070185/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2UDQRUHFPSJIO&keywords=irma+voth&qid=1552915235&s=books&sprefix=irma+voth%2Cstripbooks%2C117&sr=1-1-catcorr),â about a Mennonite teen-ager who gets involved in a film shoot near her familyâs farm in Mexico. The director is given to grandiose pronouncements like âIf youâre not prepared to risk your life, then leave nowâ; Irma, who serves as the Plautdietsch interpreter on set, cannily mistranslates the script so that, when the obedient wife is supposed to tell her husband that she loves him, she instead says that she is tired of putting up with his crap.\n\nLately, Toews has focussed her _schputting_ on the city of Toronto, and her neighborhood in particularâtoo aloof, with its pet spas and hipper-than-thou boutiques. âI think my friends have heard me complaining enough about Torontonians not saying hi,â she said, but she canât help herself. The other day, as she was brushing snow off her car, she had yelled out a big, chipper âHey!â to a passerby who kept on walking as though he hadnât heard a thing, and she was still annoyed.\n\nShe moved to the city ten years ago, from Winnipeg, where she had spent most of her adult life; her marriage was ending, her sister, Marj, was sick, Georgia wanted to go to standup-comedy school, and Toews needed a change of scene. To this day, she feels like a traitor. âNobody moves away from Winnipeg, especially to Toronto, and escapes condemnation,â she wrote, in â[All My Puny Sorrows](https://www.amazon.com/All-Puny-Sorrows-Miriam-Toews/dp/1940450713/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=All+My+Puny+Sorrows&qid=1552915254&s=books&sr=1-1),â her novel about her sisterâs illness and death. âItâs like leaving the Crips for the Bloods.â\n\nElvira followed soon after. She lives on the first floor of the house; Toews and Erik Rutherford, her partner of nearly a decade, live on the second. The domestic mood is that of an intergenerational dorm, with Rutherford as the house chef, and Elvira the resident sports nut; when the doorbell rings, it plays âTake Me Out to the Ballgame.â In âAll My Puny Sorrows,â Toews describes a character based on her mother as âa short, fat seventy-six-year-old Mennonite prairie woman who has lived most of her life in one of the countryâs most conservative small towns, who has been tossed repeatedly through lifeâs wringer,â yet who remains âjovial and curious and delighted and oblivious to snottiness.â Elvira is eighty-three now, but otherwise little changed. A few weeks earlier, a wheel had come off her walker, and she fell in the kitchen at night. While she waited to be discovered, she sang German hymns, includingâto tell it made her laugh and laughâone with the verse âI wonât walk without you, Lord, / not a single step.â\n\nOver a lunch of butter-chicken rotis, the conversation turned to Toewsâs novels. An Elvira-like figure appears in just about all of them, pragmatic, comical, full of good sense, though some of these incarnations are more fictional than others.\n\nâI have no secrets left, and thatâs O.K.,â Elvira said. âI stand behind Miriam one hundred per cent. She has a mind I donât have, and I know that. And with what they call your coming-out storyââ\n\nâComing-of-age story,â Toews said. âÂ â[A Complicated Kindness](https://www.amazon.com/Complicated-Kindness-Publisher-Counterpoint/dp/B004S6UOXA/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=A+Complicated+Kindness&qid=1552915270&s=books&sr=1-4).âÂ â\n\nThe novel, published in 2004, is narrated by sixteen-year-old Nomi Nickel, who has begun to rebel against the repressive religious culture of her small Mennonite town. It won the Governor Generalâs Literary Award for Fiction and became a best-seller, the kind of book that gets assigned in school and included on lists of novels that âmake you proud to be a Canadian,â and it turned Toews, a niche, indie sort of Canadian writer, into a famous one. It is a master class in _schputting;_ not even Menno Simons, for whom the faith is named, gets away with his dignity intact, and many Mennonites took offense.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c8bcdf70c54352cc28c085e]||||||\n+++\n\nâI read that book from beginning to end,â Elvira said, âand I told her, âWell, Miriam, itâs a good thing weâre Mennonites. At least you wonât get shot.âÂ â\n\nâBut I was nervous,â Toews said.\n\nElvira brought up a friend who had met a group of Steinbachers on a Mennonite heritage cruise to Ukraine. âAll he did was mention her name, and they just erupted. âMiriam Toews tells lies!â I think I can actually be so bold as to say that there is hatred against Miriam, though what Mennonites donât do is confront you.â\n\nâIt was Marj who also really helped me a lot, who told me, âListen, people are going to come after you, people will be angry,âÂ â Toews said. âShe told me to say this thing Iâve said for so long, and so often, which is that itâs not a critique of the Mennonite faith or of Mennonite people but of fundamentalism, of that culture of control. I wish that people who felt that they were being personally attacked could step back and say, âMaybe she is really talking about the hypocrisy of the intolerance, the oppressiveness, particularly for girls and women, the emphasis on shame and guilt and punishment.âÂ â Her voice was catching. âWe all have a right to fight in life.â\n\nâI knew people would talk about it, even if maybe not to our faces,â Elvira said, âand I didnât want to just say, âWell, you can like it or not like it, it doesnât matter.â I wanted what, to me, would be an answer, and I didnât have one until I went to one of Miriamâs readings in Winnipeg. There was my neighbor from Steinbach, from when I was a kid. I said, âWhat are you doing here?â And she said, âElvira, when I knew that Miriam was going to be here in person I decided, Iâm going. How could she write about how I felt when I was growing up in Steinbach?â And that was my answer, too.â\n\nElvira has the only landline in the house; when it rings, itâs more often than not an old friend from Steinbach, calling to let her know that another of their cohort is gone. Later, upstairs and out of earshot, Toews did an impression of her mother on the receiver: â_Oh_, good. _Oh_, good. What a relief that must be. Heâs with the Lord now.â She said, âI can sit on the stairs and listen in on these conversations like a little kid at Christmas, and think, Wow! Imagine that. That terror of deathâthey just donât have it.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThree days later, Toews was in southern Manitoba, driving from Winnipeg to SteinbachââShitville, as we called it,â she said, staring grimly ahead. It was fifteen degrees below zero. Snow slithered across the lanes like smoke. The sky was a blinding blue, the prairie a dazzling white. Parallel to the highway, Maersk freight containers in child-bright reds and blues rolled steadily down a train track. Steinbach is forty miles from the city; forty years, too, the joke goes. Although Toews had readily agreed to show me around, she was feeling apprehensive.\n\nâSee that feed mill there, with all that rigging?â she said. âThere was one in Steinbach that I would always pretend was a ship, like I was living in some port city and could sail away.â\n\nWe passed a sign for the Mennonite Heritage VillageâToews used to work there during the summer, churning butter for touristsâand one advertising the manufacturing business founded by Elviraâs father. He had left the business to his sons; his daughters had inherited a comparatively modest fixed sum, and had lived comparatively modest lives. âIt doesnât matter to me, except that it was unfair,â Toews said. Not long after Silvia was born, she e-mailed one of her cousins to ask if he might give them some good, solid windows from the company for the babyâs nursery, but he didnât oblige. âAnd Owen said, âWell, a lesson in the patriarchy is more valuable for Silvia than a window.âÂ â\n\nIn âA Complicated Kindness,â Nomi Nickel skewers her townâs homogeneity: âWe all looked pretty much the same, like a science fiction universe.â Steinbach has changed since Toewsâs day. It is now classified as a cityâin Manitoba, any place with more than seventy-five hundred people can beâand has a growing immigrant population. We drove by a Mexican joint, a sushi joint, a tattoo parlor. Three years ago, Steinbach hosted its first gay-pride parade; the mayor didnât attend, but Toews did.\n\nShe stopped for old timesâ sake in the parking lot of Frantz Inn, the spot just outside the town limits where she went drinking as a teen. Her Steinbach had been dry. Now a business on Main Street advertised home wine-making kits. âYou can make some wine, get a tattoo, and then go see a movie,â she said. âWhat would our forefathers _think_?â\n\nIt is not lost on Toews that her separatist ancestorsâ fates have depended on those who wield worldly power, or that their pacifism has often been contingent on the conquest of other peoples. The founders of Steinbach came from Russia in the eighteen-seventies, at the invitation of the newly formed Canadian government, which offered them land that had been wrested from people of the First Nations. The newcomers belonged to a particularly punitive sect of Mennonites. Harmonizing while singing hymns was considered sinful, and so was dancing. Trains might encourage contact with the outside world, so Steinbach had no station. Someone who was thought to have done or said something unacceptable could be shunned by the church, and cast out of the community.\n\nBy the time Toews was born, in 1964, shunning was no longer official practice, but the atmosphere remained oppressive, nosy, censorious. âItâs a town that exists in the world based on the idea of it not existing in the world,â Nomi Nickel says.\n\n> It was created as a kind of no-frills bunker in which to live austerely, shun wrongdoers and kill some time, and joy, before the Rapture. The idea is that if we can successfully deny ourselves the pleasures of this world, weâll be first in line to enjoy the pleasures of the next world, forever. But Iâve never really understood what those pleasures will be.\n\nâThatâs Elmdale School, where my dad taught,â Toews said, as we drove by a building so squat it seemed nearly sunken. She was his student in sixth grade, and didnât know how to reconcile the alert, engaging man in the classroom with the silent father who often went directly to his bedroom and shut the door when he got home. Mel Toews had been diagnosed with manic depression at seventeen, and for long stretches did not speak at all; she could count on one hand the times that her father laughed. But she could sometimes get him to smile, and she liked the challenge of trying.\n\nWhen she was a child, the rules were simple. âDonât lie, and donât throw stones,â Elvira told her; otherwise she did pretty much as she liked. The familyâs sombre, conservative church bored her. Mel had a perfect attendance record; Elvira let her nap in the pews.\n\n> Somehow all the problems of the world manage to get into our town but not the strategies to deal with them. We pray. And pray and pray and pray.\n\nBut the churchâs theology embedded itself in her mind. If everything was due to the will of God, what about terrible things? She had to avoid provoking some disaster. She created an obsessive private ritual, kneeling by her bed every night to beg God for forgiveness. âI had to pray for every little detail, every little infraction that I could possibly think of, and also express gratitude to God for everybody in my extended family, or something might happen to me in the middle of the night and I could go to Hell, obviously,â she said. She finally stopped after Elvira discovered her kneeling with her head on the mattress, fast asleep.\n\nIt was Marj, six years older, studious and intense like their father, who took church seriously. âShe started her personal rebellionâher personal development as a human being, reallyâmuch earlier than I did, and I think she suffered as a result,â Toews said. âShe couldnât fit into that town, but she didnât really know how to pretend to fit until she could get out, which is what I did.â\n\nMarj was troubled by church politics, and by all that talk of damnation and shame. She could not understand why pimply fifteen-year-old boys could get up and address the congregation, while mature women were forbidden to speak at all. âShe would in a very earnest way confront people like my uncles, who were ultraconservative, and ministers, too,â Toews said. As a teen-ager, Marj withdrew her church membership and left to study history at the University of Manitoba. She wished that the minister had come to talk over her decision with her; if her soul truly was at stake, she thought that it should be worth a fight.\n\nWe pulled up across the street from the familyâs old church. In front, the words â*A Time to Listen and Lament*{: .small}â were printed on a letter-board sign.\n\nâThey keep coming up with real zingers,â Toews said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen Toews was in high school, Elvira underwent what Toews came to call her personal Velvet Revolution. She considered running for mayor of Steinbach, but worried that Mel would be mortified if she disturbed the status quo.\n\n> One day she got out of bed and went into the bathroom. She looked at herself in the mirror and said, What will I choose? Freedom or insanity?\n\nAt forty, she joined Marj at the University of Manitoba and got a degree in social work. After graduation, she was posted to Steinbach with Child and Family Services, the only social worker who lived in town.\n\nElvira had always known that there was darkness around her. Her mother-in-law was an alcoholic, getting drunk on bottles of vanilla extract. And something had happened to Marj, too, when she was about ten. A group of boys, strangers, took her away in a car, returning her hours later; her new white hat had been so fouled that it had to be thrown away. But it wasnât until Elvira got to Child and Family Services, and started knocking on doors, that she saw evil up closeâhow husbands treated wives, how wives shut their eyes to what their husbands did to their sons and daughters, how nobody spoke of what she had seen or heard. Later, as Toews wrote âWomen Talking,â she thought of what her mother had told her about that time.\n\n> Salomeâs youngest daughter, Miep, was violated by the men on two or possibly three different occasions, but Peters denied medical treatment for Miep, who is three years of age, on the grounds that the doctor would gossip about the colony and that people would become aware of the attacks and the whole incident would be blown out of proportion.\n\nEventually, Elvira opened a private therapy practice in Marjâs old bedroom. Her friends informed her that she was a feminist. She disagreed, categorically; her church said that feminism was sinful. Then she examined the evidence and decided that yes, in fact she was.\n\nToewsâs own rebellion was more straightforward. She drank and smoked, bought a leather jacket, went to punk concerts in Winnipeg. She switched to a more lenient church, and eventuallyâundramaticallyâstopped going. As soon as she graduated from high school, she was gone: biking in Ireland, sleeping on beaches in Greece, learning French in Quebec.\n\nShe moved to Winnipeg to study film in college, and had Owen when she was twenty-two. Her relationship with his father didnât last long; he left soon after she gave birth. But she loved the chaotic, improvised joy of motherhood. She wasnât some modest Mennonite housewife, subject to her husbandâs will. She could do it her own way.\n\nShe met a Mennonite guy, lapsed like her, a street performer who ate fire and juggled machetes over peopleâs heads. He had a daughter, she had Owen, and soon they had Georgia. In the summer, they would pile the kids into their beat-up VW van, and travel to street-performance festivals all over North Americaââa real seat-of-the-pants existence.â She didnât believe in marriageââlike the existence of Heaven and Hell, itâs never really taken with meââbut, on a stop in Vegas, Georgia begged her parents to make things official. They said their vows in front of a fat-Elvis impersonator that night.\n\nToews had started writing during a year she spent studying journalism in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Sheâd been reporting a radio documentary for the CBC about single mothers on welfareâsheâd been one herself, when she was alone with Owenâand started working on a novel about them instead. She was twenty-eight, and told herself that she would have the novel done by thirty. Books had been highly valued in her house; her father had helped found the townâs library. But writing one didnât seem like something that a Mennonite girl from the prairie should, or could, do, and she avoided telling people what she was up to. Quietly, she sent her manuscript to Turnstone Press, a small Winnipeg publishing house, and â[Summer of My Amazing Luck](https://www.amazon.com/Summer-my-Amazing-Luck-Novel/dp/1640091858/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Summer+of+My+Amazing+Luck+toews&qid=1552915312&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull),â a picaresque account of two welfare moms having loopy adventures and getting by in the city, appeared in 1996\\. She dedicated it to Elvira.\n\nThe novelâs voice was amused, warm, curious, alive on the page. Toews won a prize for the most promising writer from Manitoba. She had a job in a bookstore at the time, and whenever she saw her novel on the shelf sheâd think, Holy shit, I got away with it! So she did it again, and two years later published â[A Boy of Good Breeding](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Good-Breeding-Novel-ebook/dp/B07FJV1646/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=A+Boy+of+Good+Breeding+toews&qid=1552915332&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull),â about a free-spirited young mother in a Canadian prairie town. Both books featured loving but befuddled fathers and comically determined mothers, but they didnât mention Mennonites. That part of herself she didnât want to touch.\n\nBefore âSummer of My Amazing Luckâ was finished, her father had a heart attack, and retired. Teaching had sustained him through his depression. Without it, he fell apart. He broke his perfect church-attendance record and stopped eating. Eventually, he was admitted to the hospital in Steinbach. Marj made the nurses promise that they would not release him, even if he told them that he felt fine. He could be very convincing, she said.\n\nAll his life, Mel had written to himself on yellow recipe cards, notes on topics he planned to research, or to-do lists that he put on top of his shoes before bed. In the hospital, too confused to do very much, he asked Miriam to write down words for him. She wrote, âYou will be well again.â He had trouble understanding who âyouâ was, so she began to address him in the first person, as if she could script his inner monologue herself: âI will be well again.â\n\nIn May, 1998, two weeks shy of his sixty-third birthday, Mel got a pass to leave the hospital and hitched a ride to Woodridge, thirty miles away, a town that, unlike Steinbach, the train passed through. He walked onto the tracks. In his pockets were yellow cards, all blank.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Toews grieved, she read everything she could about suicide. She started writing a symbolic sort of book involving a ghost, but it was stilted and she gave it up. Then she remembered how she had communicated with her father in the hospital, writing to him in his own voice, and began again.\n\nâ[Swing Low](https://www.amazon.com/Swing-Low-Life-Miriam-Toews/dp/1559705876/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Swing+Low+toews&qid=1552915346&s=books&sr=1-1-catcorr),â which appeared in 2000, is called a memoir, but the memories in it are Melâs. She wrote in the first person, from his point of view, and as she did she came to realize that his ordinary small-town life, with its quiet routines and occasional excitements and upsets, had been, for him, a triumphant achievement. She put words to his faith and to his pious fear, his bafflement at his worldly daughters, his love for his defiant wife. Sometimes she wrote things that she knew Mel could never have thought, but that she wished he might have thought one day, to help both of them find peace.\n\n> If Elvira is not dead, if I have not killed her, if she is still thinking about freedom or insanity, mulling it over in the city where sheâs resting, I would say to her: Freedom, sweetheart.\n\nIn Steinbach, we stopped at MJâs KafÃ© for Mennonite comfort food. Toews ordered _vereniki_, chewy white dumplings filled with white cottage cheese and covered in a thick white sauce called _schmauntfat_, with a hard split sausage on the side. She checked her phone. She had an e-mail from Andrew Unger, a Steinbach high-school teacher with whom she has become friendly. He teaches âA Complicated Kindnessâ to his juniors and seniors, and had sent her a photo of one of his studentsâ copies, bristling with sticky notes like the scan of a brain with all neurons firing. Toews still gets letters from readers thanking her for the book. In Toronto, she had shown me one, from a fifty-two-year-old single father, who told her that he hadnât so identified with a teen-ager since reading â[The Outsiders](https://www.amazon.com/Outsiders-S-Hinton/dp/014240733X/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=The+Outsiders&qid=1552915367&s=books&sr=1-3),â by S.Â E. Hinton.\n\nOnce she had given her father his voice, hers could be free. âI think I had probably always wanted to write that book,â Toews told me. âBut I couldnât write about Steinbach in any kind of critical way while my dad was alive. I didnât want to upset or offend him, or make him sad. And it would have created fear in him, too.â\n\nUnger runs a humor Web site called the Daily Bonnet, a sort of Mennonite Onion. A few years ago, he caused something of a stir with an [article](http://dailybonnet.com/massive-miriam-toews-statue-to-be-erected-in-steinbach/) announcing that a massive statue of Toews was to be erected in the center of Steinbach. âWeâve done nothing as a community to recognize or honor her,â he told me later. âI think that if she had become an N.H.L. hockey star rather than one of Canadaâs foremost writers, there would be a sign on the edge of town saying, âWelcome to Steinbach, Home of Miriam Toews.âÂ â\n\nEven so, Toewsâs books are now on the shelves at the Steinbach library. We found them for sale, too, at the Mennonite Heritage Village gift shop, near a T-shirt that read, âSure Mennonite girls can cook, but Mennonite boys can _eat_.â Back in the car, Toews was quiet. Then she said, âThat was the best visit Iâve had in a long time.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAt the start of âA Complicated Kindness,â Nomiâs mother and rebellious older sister have left home under mysterious circumstances that have to do with the church and its brutal, sanctimonious leader. Nomi lives with her father, a schoolteacher who cannot make sense of what has happened to his family and spends most nights sitting in a lawn chair, staring at the highway that runs past their house. Toews had wanted to give Mel life on the page one last time, but, as she wrote, she sensed that she was beginning to lose her sister.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c8bcdf7dfbc452c90377f7c]||||||\n+++\n\nMarj had suffered from crippling depression since adolescence, and her adulthood was marked by suicidal episodes. In â[The Flying Troutmans](https://www.amazon.com/Flying-Troutmans-Novel-Miriam-Toews-ebook/dp/B07L3P79MB/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Flying+Troutmans+toews&qid=1552915438&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull),â Toewsâs next novel, she appears as Min, a vital, intense woman who periodically wants to die: âItâs like sheâs living permanently in an airport terminal, moving from one departure lounge to another but never getting on a plane.â The novel is narrated by Minâs dishevelled, disorganized younger sister, Hattie, who takes Minâs kids on a road trip to find their long-gone father. Toewsâs marriage was ending; sometimes she would go to Marjâs house and lie with her, neither of them speaking, just keeping close. She wanted to write in homage to the good times that her family had spent in their van when the kids were young. Set against Minâs depression, the bookâs goofy, buoyant spirit is almost unbearably bittersweet. When Marj read it, she said, âItâs a Valentine to me.â\n\nAround the time, in early 2010, that Toews sent her editor the manuscript of âIrma Voth,â she learned that Marj had tried again to commit suicide and had been admitted to a psych ward in Winnipeg. Marj refused to eat or take medication. She wasnât befogged, as their father had been. She was clear, rational, and adamant. She asked her sister to take her to Switzerland, where she thought she could be euthanized. Toews didnât know what to do.\n\n> Canât you just be like the rest of us, normal and sad and fucked up and alive and remorseful? Get fat and start smoking and play the piano badly. Whatever! At least you know that you will eventually get what you want most in lifeâ\n>\n> What do I want most in life?\n>\n> Death!\n\nTheir aunt, Elviraâs sister, came from British Columbia to help out, suffered a heart attack, had emergency open-heart surgery, and died in the hospital. Some kind of dark irony was at work. Toews begged the nurses not to let her sister leave on any pretext. Marj could be very convincing, she said.\n\nToews was in Toronto when Elvira called to say that Marj had been granted a temporary release to celebrate her birthday at home.\n\n> I got off the phone with my mother and sat down in the palm of a molded plastic hand-shaped chair that Nora had found in somebodyâs garbage and said well, then, sheâs gone.\n\nIn early June, 2010, the day before her fifty-second birthday, Marj left the hospital and stepped in front of a train.\n\nâShe said that she wanted to be in Godâs corner,â Elvira said, after lunch in Toronto. Although Marj had left the church, she had never quite stopped believing. âWhatever that meant to her.â\n\nâAnd she did want God to forgive her,â Toews said. âYou saw the note she left, with all of our names, sending love to all of us, and saying that she hoped God would accept her.â\n\n> Whatâs a pacifist supposed to do with eternal violence if it canât be volleyed back _directly_ at the enemy?\n\nMarj didnât want to be buried in Steinbach. She was cremated, her ashes interred at a cemetery in Winnipeg. It comforts Elvira to know where she is. The funeral was held at a local community center; Elviraâs church in Winnipeg helped out, though by that time she had stopped going there, out of principle. âThey had moved to a district that seemed not safe,â Elvira said. âSo on Sunday morning, after the church people were in, they would lock the door. And that made me _furious!_ I said, âLook, we have the Gospel, which means that we invite anybody and everybody in. I refuse to support this church if you have that door locked, and thatâs the long and short of it.âÂ It was ridiculous! What good is a church with locked doors?â\n\nElvira went to the upright piano and played a hymn, âChildren of the Heavenly Father,â that had been sung at Melâs and Marjâs funerals.\n\nWhen she finished, Toews said, âI canât hear it without crying.â She was holding Austin, bouncing him a little. She has recently begun seeing a therapist, a trauma specialist who recommends that she synchronize her breathing with her grandchildrenâs. She worries what they might be carrying in their blood.\n\nâWe have much to cry about in our family, and much to be thankful for,â Elvira said.\n\nâItâs a lot of pressure, though, isnât it?â Toews said.\n\nIn âAll My Puny Sorrows,â Marj is Elfrieda Von Riesen, a celebrated classical pianist, and Toews is Yoli, a young-adult writer who is struggling to finish a literary novel. Just about everything else is true to life. For all the horror and sadness and pain inherent in her story, the novel is hilarious, bursting with soul. It was important to Toews that the book be as funny as she could make it, because that is what life is likeâbrutal, comic, everything happening at the wrong moment. It was important, too, that it not end with the suicide. She needed to show herself and her mother making a new life for themselves in a new place, battered but still breathing.\n\nIn one scene, Yoli and her mother attend the funeral for her aunt. Afterward, there is a _freiwilligis_, a Mennonite tradition in which friends and relatives tell stories about the departed. As a cousinâs wife gets up to speak, her toddler crawls onto the stage and toward the urn:\n\n> He sat next to it and banged on it for a while and then, while his mother, oblivious, kept talking about Tina and all her charming qualities, her boldness, her tenderness, her zest for life, the little kid somehow managed to take the lid off the urn. We all watched, open-mouthed, as he started to sift through the ashes of Tina and then fling them around up there, having a heyday playing with his great-grandmaâs remains.\n\nThe toddler begins to put the ashes in his mouth, and his mother stops talking. Then his father picks him up and brushes him off:\n\n> The mother, my cousinâs wife, turned calmly back to the microphone and finished her story about Tina and her van and I learned another thing, which is that just because someone is eating the ashes of your protagonist doesnât mean you stop telling the story.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nToews is an artist of escape; she always finds a way for her characters, trapped by circumstance, to liberate themselves. Even so, âWomen Talkingâ was particularly taxing to write. It could be claustrophobic, spending so much mental time in that barn contemplating evil, listening to those confined women, trying to figure out how they might get free. âI could feel the blood pounding in my body and my head,â Toews said. She thought she might have a stroke. âI know that everybody struggles when they write. Just, for me, this particular book had a ticking-time-bomb feeling to it.â She started her writing days with a sudoku puzzle, for the reassurance of organizing numbers instead of words, and lighted a sandalwood-scented candle, to encourage calm. Later, she went back and added episodes of action that serve as valves to release narrative steam, and humor, to deepen its flavors, like salt. She dedicated the book to Marj, with an inscription in Italian, a language she lovesââ_ricordo le risate_â (âI remember the laughterâ)âand to her partner, Erik: â_e ancora ridiamo_â (âand still we laughâ).\n\nRecently, touring with the novel, Toews has been approached at readings by people who tell her that they had heard rumors about what was happening at Manitoba Colony, and were told to pray about the problem. Toews understands. That is what she has done, in her own secular way. âYou could say, âWhat difference is this going to make?â Or you could say, âItâs thinking. Itâs hoping. Itâs asking.âÂ â\n\n> But is forgiveness that is coerced true forgiveness? asks Ona Friesen. And isnât the lie of pretending to forgive with words but not with oneâs heart a more grievous sin than to simply not forgive? Canât there be a category of forgiveness that is up to God alone, a category that includes the perpetration of violence upon oneâs children, an act so impossible for a parent to forgive that God, in His wisdom, would take exclusively upon Himself the responsibility for such forgiveness?\n\nIf there can be said to be a protagonist of âWomen Talking,â it is odd, dreamy Ona Friesen. She is afflicted with a nervous condition that other colonists call Narfa; they consider her tainted, unmarriageable, and keep their distance. Her younger sister, Salome, is fiercely protective of her, but they donât always see eye to eye. Salome wants to fight, to draw blood from the men who have hurt her; Ona wants merely the freedom to think. She is calmer than the thrilling, furious older sister of âA Complicated Kindness,â and more hopeful than the despairing one of âThe Flying Troutmansâ and âAll My Puny Sorrows.â She wants to survive. And there is a man who loves her: August Epp, a shy, anxious outsider, treated contemptuously by the other men. Ona invites him to sit with the women as they conduct their conversation, to take the minutes, for posterity. He admires the womenâs courage. Wherever they go, he canât follow. Theyâll meet again after death, or they wonât. No one can say. They know only that if they leave they wonât be turning back.Â â¦\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"functional-tags":[{"id":"5c7fffef68f3a83129be1f5a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple News Opt In","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple-news-opt-in"},{"id":"5baa883e8688f82d6d666ad0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple News Paid","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple-news-paid"},{"id":"5baa8845956e672d0b2db124","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple News Preview","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple-news-preview"}],"sections":[{"id":"59112bb5df652b705f4abe45","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Life and Letters","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"life-and-letters"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a03fc019dfc3494ea4180","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Alexandra Schwartz has been a a staff writer atÂ *The New Yorker* since 2016.

At [President Trumpâs](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) second [State of the Union address](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/state-of-the-union), a triangular tranche of the House of Representatives stood out in the familiar sea of suits, as if lit by a spotlight: the female members of the 116th Congress, dressed in cream, eggshell, and alabaster, the traditional shades of the suffragette movement. Shown from above, they looked like a slice of wedding cake on a dark tablecloth. When the camera came in low to pan across their faces, they looked like a choir between numbers, murmuring a remark to a neighbor, raising an eyebrow. (Their conductor, [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), shuffled papers from her station, behind the President, in a pants suit the color of a fresh ream bound for the printer.) Before the Presidential pageantry began, the congresswomen posed on a spiral staircase in two long rows, as if ready to descend, Busby Berkeley style, into the chamber below. You canât compose an image like that if you donât have the numbers for it. A hundred and three women are serving in the House of Representatives, which makes the 116th Congress the most female in history, as well as the most diverse. Seated in front of the President, they looked like a battalion: purposeful, united, prepared to fight together against their adversary in the skewed red tie.\n\nSymbolic dressing has become a trend in the past couple of years, at awards shows as well as at political ones. Last year, congresswomen wore black to the State of the Union, as Hollywood actresses did, in the same month, to the Golden Globes, to show support for the [#MeToo movement](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/me-too). But the last time white clothes got as much political attention as they did on Tuesday night was on Election Day in 2016, when women wore white to the polls to cast their vote for Hillary Clinton, who had embraced suffragette white on the campaign trail, and had worn a symbolic white suit to her second debate against Trump. (She wore one to his Inauguration, too.) Social media that day was filled with selfies taken by voters in white dresses, T-shirts, and jackets, elated in the belief that they were electing the countryâs first female President. As the results came in, and the optimism melted away, that hopeful white came to seem absurd and naÃ¯ve, even obscene. I was probably not the only person who found it difficult to look at the dopey white dress hanging in her closet, still bearing its wrinkled âI Votedâ sticker.\n\nBut progress has been made in these past few years, and the white worn by the congresswomen at the State of the Union seemed celebratory as well as defiant. This year marks a century since the Nineteenth Amendment, granting American women the right to vote, was passed by Congress. Some of the congresswomen accessorized their outfits with vintage E.R.A. pins from the nineteen-seventies; that amendment may have failed, but it is heartening to see that its fighting spirit, and funky font, live on. Even Tiffany Trump showed up in a belted white dress, though whether this constituted a message of defiance, or merely an innocent fashion choice, was impossible to say. (Melania and Ivanka Trump avoided misinterpretation by wearing black.)\n\nIn 2016, Clintonâs embrace of suffragette white raised questions about the exclusion and prejudice that have marred this countryâs womenâs movement since Seneca Falls. Given the racism displayed by so many suffragettes, could modern progressive women truly embrace the color? Ayanna Pressley, the congresswoman from Massachusetts, who wore a white coat and carried a kente-cloth clutch, came up with an elegant response. âTonight, I honor women like #AlicePaul who led the movement & women like #IdaB who were excluded from it,â she [wrote](https://twitter.com/AyannaPressley/status/1092927237958103045) on Twitter.\n\nNot far into his speech, Trump began, somewhat ironically, to salute the recent gains made by American women. âNo one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled fifty-eight per cent of the new jobs created in the last year,â he said. The congresswomen in white looked at one another dubiously. Was this even true? They started to stand up. Even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got to her feet. They were going to take Trumpâs statement as a compliment. Some of them shimmied, and pumped their fists in the air. Trump, risking an ad-lib, joked, âYou werenât supposed to do that.â More women are in the workplace than ever, he went on. âAnd we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.â Nancy Pelosi, stirring to life, stood and extended her hands to the bloc in white, as if to say, Screw the d.j., but heâs playing our song! The congresswomen again leapt to their feet. A robust, surprising âU.S.A.! U.S.A.!â chant started up in their honor.

The director and editor, Todd Douglas Miller, tells the story of the moon launch using archival footage, including a trove of 70-mm. film commissioned by *NASA*{: .small} at the time of the launch. The film has no voice-over narration. Instead its story is relayed by the newscasts of Walter Cronkite and the radio transmissions of Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and their interlocutors on Earth. \n\nThe result is a visual museum about America in July, 1969, in which Aldrinâs famous 16-mm. footage of the lunar module approaching the surface of the moon is only a little more compelling than the thousands of picnickers who gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch the rocket launch, with their station wagons, cat-eye sunglasses, flowered bathing caps, Technicolor minidresses, and coffee percolators. I had never had any particular interest in [Apollo 11](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/apollo-11), and I was surprised by how much its story moved me: the earth rises through a portal window on a spacecraft, an astronautâs solar shield gleams with the reflected surface of the moon, the red and white stripes of the parachute attached to the landing module spread out against the baby blue of the sky. \n\nThe voyage of Apollo 11 was in a sense the execution of a beautifully scripted play: the protagonists had practiced so many times that after Neil Armstrong makes his one small step, his next remarks compare the reality of the moonâs gravitational pull to the simulation. Most of the scripted elements of this play try to Americanize a lonely rock in space, from the planting of the âlunar flag assemblyâ to Armstrongâs remarks that the moon âhas a stark beauty of its own, much like the high desert of the United States.â Part of what I liked about the film is how it reclaims the wonder of human endeavor from the smallness of its patriotic recitations. Fifty yearsâ worth of Tom Hanks or George Clooney in space suits, old MTV commercials, and montages where the moonwalk is sandwiched between hippies dancing and the battlefields of Vietnam are somehow swept away, replaced by the lunar module rising from the moonâs surface, a tiny speck against its glowing cratered expanse. As E. B. White wrote, âIt is traditional, of course, for explorers to plant the flag, but it struck us, as we watched with awe and admiration and pride, that our two fellows were universal men, not national men.â\n\nNo, what moved me was not national pride but a sense of comfort inherent in any narrative depicting competency and coÃ¶peration, of steps meticulously planned and then completed. There was once a room of cigarette smokers who were really good at trigonometry and aeronautics. They cheerfully sent men to the moon and got them back home without a single slide-show presentation by an ego-driven billionaire wearing a headset. The conversations over the radio are about going home for the night (âAs the sun sinks slowly in the west the White Team bids you goodnight,â Mission Control says at the end of the day) and Ted Kennedyâs car crash at Chappaquiddick, which briefly dominates the news cycle as the astronauts are flying to the moon. One astronaut, the capsule communicator Bruce McCandless II, compares the spaceship entering into Passive Thermal Control Mode to dining in a rotating restaurant. \n\nA few days after watching âApollo 11,â I attended a media event at *NASA*{: .small}âs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena. We were invited to hear an announcement, by the *NASA*{: .small} administrator, Jim Bridenstine, about [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)âs plans for the agency. The speech would be live-streamed from the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida. \n\nIn December, 2017, Trump signed the White House Space Policy Directive 1, the goal of which is to send Americans to the moon again, for the first time since 1972. (In the fifty years since Apollo 11, the propagandists have stopped taking their literary cues from Greek mythology, Shakespeare, and the King James Bible, and started drawing from Star Trek, namely Starfleet General Order 1, otherwise known as âthe Prime Directive.â) Bridenstine filled in the details. Near-Earth orbit, he explained, will soon be the domain of the private sector, a transition that has been under way for years: âWeâre talking about manufacturing. Weâre talking about tourism. Weâre talking about pharmaceuticals, maybe fibre optics.â \n\nIn near-Earth orbit, Bridenstine said, *NASA*{: .small} will be âone client among many clients in a robust commercial marketplace,â relying on private companies for Earth-to-moon transport. He repeated variations of this phrase several times, like a mantra. I wondered what pharmaceutical companies would do in space, and imagined L.E.D. screens on the moon showing ads for treatments of eczema and depression.\n\nWith the robust commercialization of near-Earth space under way, *NASA*{: .small} will next return to the moon using âcommercial lunar-payload servicesâ: SpaceX or Boeing or Lockheed Martin will land the next generation of astronauts on the moon. Bridenstine said humans could potentially return to the moon as early as next year, and described a future in which the moon will be the launch point for Mars. The moonâs polar ice caps, discovered in 2008, contain both oxygen to breathe and hydrogen for fuel. âItâs about having a sustainable human presence on and around the moon,â Bridenstine said, which means âlanders, rovers, robots, and humans will have more access to more parts of the moon than ever before.â Trumpâs twenty-one-billion-dollar *NASA*{: .small} budget includes funding for a command and service module known as the Gateway, from which the landers and robots will dock and descend. \n\nMost of the other attendees at the event were space enthusiasts, who had applied to attend as social-media correspondents. They included students, visual artists, a park ranger, and an aspiring astronaut employed by the Air Force. They wore *NASA*{: .small} T-shirts and patches, and one even had canvas sneakers stitched with the *NASA*{: .small} logo. They were diverse in age and heritage, and their enthusiasm served as a reminder that few, if any, government agencies are as popular or beloved as *NASA*{: .small}. \n\nThe audience watched Bridenstineâs speech with dutiful attention, but its enthusiasm really emerged when we visited Mission Control, where data from deep space have been monitored continually since 1964, and the Mars Yard, where J.P.L. engineers test rover prototypes on a landscape littered with the rocks from the Mojave Desert. This was a group of people who had been watching *NASA*{: .small} live streams for yearsânow they were sitting in the very chairs in which scientists had celebrated the landing of Curiosity Rover on Mars, in 2012, with hugs and cheers, in uniforms modernized from shirts and ties to matching blue polo shirts. From a glassed-in balcony, we observed the assembly of the Mars 2020 Rover by a small fleet of workers in white suits and surgical masks. One of them saw us and waved.\n\nAt the end of the Apollo 11 documentary, after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins have returned safely to Earth, Miller plays audio from John F. Kennedyâs 1961 speech at Rice University, in which Kennedy promises to land Americans on the moon within the next decade. \n\nâBut if I were to say, my fellow-citizens,â Kennedy said, âthat we shall send to the moon, two hundred and forty thousand miles away from the control station in Houston, a giant rocket more than three hundred feet tall, the length of this football field, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and survival, on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to earth, reÃ«ntering the atmosphere at speeds of over twenty-five thousand miles per hour, causing heat about half that of the temperature of the sunâalmost as hot as it is here todayâand do all this, and do it right, and do it first, before this decade is outâthen we must be bold.â\n\nListening to this speech, I thought not about the moon but about the proposal for a Green New Deal. âThis is going to be the Great Society, the moon shot, the Civil Rights Movement of our generation,â Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a speech last December. âThat is the scale that this is going to require.â \n\nIn our national mythology, the moon shot stands for endeavor, futurism, technological advancement, and optimism. For Trump, the continuation of the myth of the moon shot will be a more long-term human presence on the moon. For the supporters of the Green New Deal, the gleam of futurism is not limited to flying machines and the colonization of celestial bodies but also applies to picturing new environmental realities and social arrangements on Earth. It is an imaginative plan, but also an urgent one. The United Nations International Panel on Climate Change has given us a time frame of a dozen years to take dramatic action, but the annihilation of our homes, food, livelihoods, and the landscapes and animals of the Earth we know has already begun. The Democratic leadership in Congress has yet to express support for the proposal, indicating that they think it naÃ¯ve. As for the Republicans, many of whom have taken large donations from oil and gas companies, they spent recent congressional hearings on climate change chuckling about cow eructation. Neither response is bold, and, whatever their reasons, our elected leadersâ paucity of endeavor baffles and enrages me. \n\n A few years ago, I read the science fiction novel â[Aurora](https://www.amazon.com/Aurora-Kim-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0316098094),â by Kim Stanley Robinson, a prolific author whose works combine elements of both social futurism and hard science fiction. This particular novel is about a multigenerational journey to an Earth-like moon in another galaxy, narrated in part by a benevolent all-knowing spaceship. The Earth-like moon, known as Aurora, turns out to be lethally inhospitable. The ship, which has started to acquire consciousness, puts the remaining crew into cryogenic comas and gets most of them home alive. Back on Earth, the returnees are received as cowards. Their pleas thatâas the protest signs of students striking for action on climate change last week put itââThere is no Planet Bâ are ignored.\n\nThe dead-end plot of this novel was very satisfying. Filling space with more industry, trash, and advertising will not improve the future we create at home. In âApollo 11,â a clip of the astronauts speaking to each other is played as they come ever closer to the moon.\n\nâThere it is. Itâs coming up!â an astronaut says.\n\nâWhat?â another asks.\n\nâThe Earth.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d3181ab3335f580f1fe","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d3181ab3335f580f1fe","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Moon","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"moon"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Moon","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"moon"},{"id":"5c2e1d3341e4c73c088d7829","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d3341e4c73c088d7829","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Earth","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"earth"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Earth","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"earth"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b397f5b30646d0608","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8b397f5b30646d0608","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"NASA","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nasa"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"NASA","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"nasa"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

He comes across as the anti-Trump, reaching out to the best in us. In his announcement video, OâRourke says that âthis moment of peril produces perhaps the greatest moment of promise for this country.â He then outlines the issues that a resolved nation can tackleâjobs, health care, racism, immigrationâbefore adding, âPerhaps most importantly of all, because our very existence depends on it, we can unleash the ingenuity and creativity of millions of Americans who want to insure that we squarely confront the challenge of [climate change](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/climate-change), before itâs too late.â Thatâs an essential goal, and, in the coming weeks, the candidate could demonstrate how he can help the country achieve it by clarifying his stance on a seemingly narrow issue: natural gas.  \n\nLast October, in the heart of Texas hydrocarbon country and in the final weeks of his Senate contest with [Ted Cruz](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-ted-cruzbeto-orourke-debate-offers-two-very-different-views-of-texas), OâRourke [told the Midland *Reporter-Telegram*](https://www.mrt.com/news/article/Cruz-O-Rourke-on-energy-13215655.php) that âthe natural gas that we use as a cleaner energy source here in this country could be something that replaces coal-fired plants in China, in Indiaâtwo of the largest economies on the planet that are burning coal and contributing to climate change. Iâd much rather they burn natural gas from Texas thatâs connected to jobs here.â\n\nOn Thursday, in Keokuk, Iowa, during his first campaign appearance as a Presidential candidate, OâRourke praised the [Green New Deal](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/green-new-deal), particularly its call to âget to [net-zero emissions](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-good-news-about-a-green-new-deal).â He said, âWe have no more than twelve years to take incredibly bold action on this.â To be clear, the Green New Deal envisions burning no natural gas for electricity by 2030 and instead generating power from renewable sources. No one is calling for immediately shutting down natural-gas-fired power plants, but if youâre for a Green New Deal, you probably should make clear that youâre against building new plants and the pipelines that feed them.  \n\nIn fact, that transition is already starting to happen in places such as India and China, where the use of renewable energy is increasing at a breakneck pace because it is both cheap and clean. And it could happen here, too: as the C.E.O. of a solar company said earlier this year, âI can beat a gas peaker anywhere in this country with a solar-plus-storage power plant.â \n\nBut the pressures to keep doing more of what weâre used to are enormous. Texas has the second-largest economy in the country; [oil and gas](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/01/the-dark-bounty-of-texas-oil) are still the stateâs largest industries. For employees of those companies, who, in 2018, [contributed](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01&cycle=2018&recipdetail=H&mem=Y&sortorder=U) more money to OâRourkeâs campaign than to that of any other member of Congress except Cruz (itâs Texas, after all), natural-gas production is a way to extend their livelihoods for a few more decades. (Unlike Cruz, OâRourke took no [money from *PAC*{:.small}s](https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2018/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-fundraising-texas-midterm-2018/).) Those parts of organized labor skilled at building pipelines and gas plants want to keep their jobs, too; indeed, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.âs energy committee said last week that it could not support the Green New Deal, stating in a letter to its congressional sponsors that âwe will not stand by and allow threats to our membersâ jobs and their familiesâ standard of living go unanswered.â  \n\nThese pressures are why, for eight years, President Obama supported frackingâitâs the path of least resistance. In fairness to Obama, when his term in office began, we still thought of natural gas as the cleaner fossil fuel, because it gives off less carbon when it burns than coal does. But it turns out that fracking not only pollutes water and damages communities; over the past decade, scientists have demonstrated that the [leaking methane](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-energy/coal-and-other-fossil-fuels/environmental-impacts-of-natural-gas) that invariably accompanies fracking can make natural gas as bad for the climate as coal. Meanwhile, the price of renewables has fallen so far and so fast that we no longer need a âbridge fuelâ to get us from coal to something truly clean, however convenient that prospect would be for those enmeshed in the current system. (Still, the science and the economics have not yet been enough to overcome the status quo, as I learned, in 2016, when [Bernie Sanders](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/how-will-bernie-sanders-distinguish-himself-from-the-2020-field), whom I supported, named me to the Democratic platform-writing panel; my arguments, and those of other anti-fracking campaigners, were not enough to get the document changed.)\n\nBy 2019, though, climate change has progressed to the point where a middle-of-the-road, all-of-the-above strategy is impossible: less for reasons of politics, where it may always be the easiest to sell, than for reasons of physics. OâRourke, who has been strong on a range of other environmental issues, could conceivably be a central figure in the transition to renewable energy. Oil and gas may still be dominant in Texas, but OâRourkeâs home state also has the largest [wind-power](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Texas-wind-generation-keeps-growing-state-13178629.php) capacity in the country, and it is one of the five largest producers of [solar energy](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/the-us-states-leading-the-way-in-solar.html). And, in 2017, the Bureau of Labor Statistics [reported](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm) that solar photovoltaic installers and wind-turbine-service technicians are the fastest-growing occupations in the country. So, just as it took a politician of the right, Richard Nixon, to open up relations with China, a Texan might be just the person to persuade oil-and-gas workers that their futures can lie in building solar installations and wind farmsâand to stand up to the fossil-fuel companies and the *PAC*{: .small}s that have so dominated our politics. Because weâve run out of spare decades in which to play political games.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7a4a08312cd3aa6c3d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Green New Deal","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"green-new-deal"},{"id":"5c2e1fe6e56e652c90274965","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Natural Gas","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"natural-gas"},{"id":"5c2e1c8941c92e2c9b85da38","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fossil Fuels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fossil-fuels"},{"id":"5c2e1d4922d4972cd5b8334e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Renewable Energy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"renewable-energy"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1cb0ee7fe02cbd16337f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Beto OâRourke","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"beto-orourke"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a78b6c4c222f03a82e0e","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/bill-mckibben","email":"","name":"Bill McKibben","socialMedia":[],"title":"Bill McKibben, a former New Yorker staff writer, is a founder of the grassroots climate campaign 350.org and the Schumann Distinguished Scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College.

The resolution was larded with goals not directly tied to the environment, such as guaranteeing everyone a job, affordable housing, and high-quality health care, and even some energy researchers who are enthusiastic proponents of transitioning rapidly to a zero-emissions economy questioned the timetable of a single decade for converting power production entirely to renewable sources. \n\nâI donât think anybody who is deep inside the substance is talking about that,â Jonathan Koomey, a special adviser to the chief scientist at the Rocky Mountain Institute, told me. Robert Pollin, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who has helped design a number of Green New Deals for individual states, including New York and Washington, said, âI think it is wonderful that the issue is being addressed, but I donât think this movement has yet accepted that you have to do these things carefully and rigorously.â \n\nDespite these reservations, Koomey and Pollin, as well as a number of other researchers I spoke with, said the drafters of the Green New Deal were perfectly right to urge large-scale action across many parts of the economy, and they emphasized the technological opportunities that now exist to meet many of the environmental goals that underpin the proposed legislation, if not the exact timetable it lays down. In [a report](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-dire-warnings-of-the-united-nations-latest-climate-change-report) released in October, which the Democratic resolution cites and endorses, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that if the world is to contain the rise in global temperatures to 1\\.5 degrees Celsius, carbon emissions must be reduced by about fifty per cent before 2030, and completely phased out before 2050. For a U.S. economy that currently relies on fossil fuels for about four-fifths of its energy, achieving zero emissions, or something close to it, by the middle of the century would be a historic transformation. And, according to all the researchers I spoke with, rapidly advancing technology and the falling costs of clean energy make this more achievable than ever.  \n\nâRight now, we have about ninety per cent or ninety-five per cent of the technology we need,â Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford, told me. In a series of papers, Jacobson and his colleagues have laid out âroadmapsâ to a zero-emissions economy for fifty states, fifty-three towns and cities, and a hundred and thirty-eight other  countries, with a completion date of 2050. Just as in the Democratsâ Green New Deal, the central element of these roadmaps (and others) is converting the electric grid to clean energy by shutting down power stations that rely on fossil fuels and making some very large investments in wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal facilities. Jacobson said this could be completed by 2035, which is only five years beyond the target set out in the Green New Deal. At the same time, policymakers would introduce a range of measures to promote energy efficiency, and electrify other sectors of the economy that now rely heavily on burning carbon, such as road and rail transport, home heating, and industrial heating. âWe donât need a technological miracle to solve this problem,â Jacobson reiterated. ââThe bottom line is we just need to deploy, deploy, deploy.â\n\nSaul Griffith, a materials scientist and inventor who is the chief executive of OtherLab, a San Francisco-based technology incubator that focusses on clean energy, agrees. In recent presentations, Griffith has sketched out an aggressive plan for switching to clean power and electrifying heating and transportation, which he says could be completed within twenty years. âItâs entirely reasonable to do it,â he said. âThe United States is lucky because of its natural advantages. Itâs a country with low population density, good wind, good solar, and good hydro resources. The only reason not to do it is political inertia and the influence of the existing fossil-fuel industry.â \n\nPollin is working on a national zero-emissions plan with an end date of 2050\\. He said it will combine many of the elements in the Green New Deal, such as stricter emissions standards, extensive public investments, and tax incentives for reducing carbon consumption and investing in clean energy. And, like the Democratic proposal, Pollin stresses the need to provide financial aid and retraining for people currently working in fossil-fuel industries, which would be shrunken drastically under any such plan. âIt needs to be done, and it can be done,â he said. âBut it needs to be done judiciously.â \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nUnderlying a lot of the optimism is a steep fall in the cost of generating electricity from renewable sources. With the development of bigger wind turbines, the cost reductions associated with wind power have been particularly impressive. Mara Prentiss, a professor of physics at Harvard whose book â[Energy Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Energy-Revolution-Physics-Efficient-Technology/dp/0674725026),â from 2015, emphasized the potential of renewable energy, pointed out to me that doubling the diameter of a turbine yields four times as much power, and that some modern turbines have diameters of a hundred metres. Costs have also fallen sharply in the solar-power industry, where there has been great progress in building more cost-efficient photovoltaic systems, including solar cells, inverters, and transformers. Just a decade ago, Pollin pointed out, electricity generated from sunlight cost about twice as much as electricity generated from coal;  now, the costs are roughly equal. \n\nEvery year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration calculates a levelized cost of electricity, or L.C.O.E., which  represents the average per-megawatt-hour cost of building and operating a power-generating plant over the course of its life cycle. For power facilities that would enter service in 2023, the E.I.A. estimated the L.C.O.E.s of onshore wind and solar at $42\\.80 and $48.80, respectively, compared with $40.20 for advanced natural-gas power stations. (The L.C.O.E. of  nuclear would be around ninety dollars).  Some existing coal-fired plants are cheaper, but they are also very dirty. In calculating the future cost of electricity generated from coal, the E.I.A. assumes that new coal-fired plants would be built with sophisticated systems to capture and sequester carbon emissions. Allowing for this requirement, the E.I.A. estimates the L.C.O.E. of coal-powered plants entering service in 2023 at close to  a hundred dollars.\n\nThese figures suggest that, going forward, electricity generated from renewable sources will be competitive with natural gas, and cheaper than coal and nuclear power. (And these figures donât take into account the existing tax credits for investing in clean energy. When these credits are included, the L.C.O.E.s of onshore wind and solar are even lower: $36\\.60 and $37.60, respectively.) In some parts of the country, energy consumers are already benefitting from these trends. Prentiss pointed out to me that Iowa now generates more than thirty-five per cent of its electricity from wind. The retail cost of electricity in the state is 8\\.73 cents per kilowatt-hour, she said, compared to a national average of 10.48 cents.\n\nIowa, of course, is a windy state. People need electricity all the time, regardless of the weather. For this reason, among others, the E.I.A. analysis pointed out that care should be taken in comparing the costs of different types of power. Defenders of fossil fuels go further. In a recent article about the Green New Deal, Myron Ebell, an analyst at the Washington-based Competitive Enterprise Institute, which receives some of its funding from oil and gas companies, wrote that the electricity grid âcannot operate on 100% intermittent and variable powerâor even 50%.â \n\nOptimists like Jacobson and Prentiss didnât deny the challenge in shifting to intermittent sources of power, which include dealing with seasonal variability and storing energy for long periods. But they point out that the development of modern grids, which use high-voltage direct-current lines, has made these issues easier to handle. In a series of papers, Jacobson and his colleagues have used simulations to demonstrate how it would be possible in theory to rely entirely on electricity generated from renewable sources. âIf you interconnect over a very large area, you smooth out the supply,â Jacobson explained. âWhen the wind is not blowing in one place, it is in another. And solar and other sources, such as hydro and geothermal, complement that, too.â\n\nKoomey said researchers generally agree that getting to eighty-per-cent reliance on renewable sources of electricity is now a practical option. âThe issue is more getting from eighty to one hundred,â he said. âI donât know yet if one hundred per cent is possible. What I do know is that the cost trends are heading in that direction. And if we can solve the problems like seasonal heat storage, we can deal with most of the remaining challenges.â When I asked Koomey about the skeptics, such as Ebell, he replied, âThe folks who are saying you canât get to fifty-per-cent or eighty-per-cent intermittency are the same folks who were saying you canât get to two per cent when wind and solar first came on.â\n\nTo guarantee a reliable electricity supply, Koomey suggested keeping some nuclear and natural-gas plants running, at least during the transition. (The Green New Deal rules out gas plants but doesnât rule out keeping some existing nuclear plants running for a time.) But rather than focussing on the challenges of going all the way to a hundred per cent, the most important thing is to recognize the scale of the transformation necessary and get started on it immediately, Koomey insisted. âSo far, all the tweaking around the edges hasnât reduced carbon emissions nearly enough,â he said. âYou need to start shutting down high-carbon infrastructure on a schedule, and you need to stop building new carbon infrastructure. Ultimately, there is no other way.â\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nEven if we did succeed in creating an electricity grid entirely powered by renewable energy, getting to zero carbon emissions for the over-all economy would involve overcoming some tough problems, such as finding practical ways to store large amounts of energy for longer periods of time, and weaning long-distance air travel and commercial shipping from the fossil fuels on which they now rely. (Jacobson and Prentiss insisted that there are technological fixes on the way in these areas, too, such as the development of better lithium batteries, and advanced hydrogen fuel cells; Prentiss also emphasized the possibilities of low-carbon biofuels and synthetic fuels.) In a recent article, Pollin argued that large-scale investments in energy efficiency, such as retrofitting buildings and switching to electric car engines, which waste a lot less energy than internal-combustion engines, âcan cut U.S. per capita energy consumption by roughly 50 percent over twenty years.â Even then, though, the investments needed in wind and solar would be very  substantial. In âEnergy Revolution,â Prentiss calculated that satisfying the countryâs total average energy needs with wind power would require covering about fifteen per cent of the U.S. landmass with wind farms, and relying entirely on solar power would require about one to 1\\.5 per cent of the landmass to be devoted to solar farms. Not for nothing does the Green New Deal resolution talk of a Second World War-style mobilization.\n\nTo illustrate how such a clean-energy economy might work, Jacobson brought up his own home on the Stanford campus, which has solar panels on the roof, two lithium batteries in the garage, and an advanced electric heat pump. âI have no gas or oil bills, no electricity bill, and no gasoline bill for cars, either,â Jacobson said. âAnd I generate twenty per cent more energy than I need, so I get paid five hundred dollars by the utility.â Jacobson estimated the up-front cost of equipping his house was about sixty thousand dollars. âWith the subsidies that the government provides, it is a five-year payback,â he said. âWithout the subsidies, it would be a ten-year payback.â \n\nHow much would it cost to create a national version of Jacobsonâs domestic economy? There are at least two ways to answer this question. The first is to look at up-front capital costs. The other is to consider long-term trends in energy costs, and to consider the large-scale social and economic dislocation that may result if we donât drastically reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAccording to Jacobson, his plan to convert the United States to clean energy would cost between ten trillion and fifteen trillion dollars, in total, depending on how it was implemented. If the plan was enacted over thirty years, that would come out to as much as five hundred billion dollars a year, or about 2\\.5 per cent of current G.D.P. Pollinâs estimates are a bit higher. To meet the I.P.C.C. emissions targets, he reckons that wealthy countries such as the United States need to invest about three per cent of current G.D.P. per year expanding renewable sources and raising energy-efficiency standards, compared to the current figure of 0\\.5 per cent.\n\nInterestingly, a new analysis of the Democratsâ Green New Deal from the conservative American Action Forum contains figures that are comparable to Jacobsonâs and Pollinâs. Taking the midpoints of its estimates, the study says it would cost $10\\.3 trillion to create a low-carbon electricity grid, a net-zero emissions transportation system, and to âupgrade all existing buildingsâ to higher energy-efficiency standards. Spread out over thirty years, the cost would be about three hundred and forty billion dollars a year, or 1.7 per cent of current G.D.P.\n\nTo be sure, thatâs a large sum. But itâs less than half of the annual defense budget, and the taxpayer wouldnât have to supply all of it. In almost all the academic transition plans that are out there, most of the capital would come from private investors and companies. The federal government would certainly make some substantial investments, too. But its main role would be to  enforce  strict emissions standards, provide tax breaks for investments in renewables and energy efficiency, raise carbon taxes to discourage fossil-fuel consumption and help finance the transition, and provide support for communities that are adversely affected. The great bulk of the energy industry, including most of the new wind and solar farms, would remain privately owned. Like the original New Deal, this would be managed capitalism rather than state socialism.  \n\nFor actual policymaking, coming up with detailed proposals in all of these areas would obviously be critical. But the first challenge is to recognize the transformative possibilities that exist and establish ambitious goals. The Green New Deal does that. It holds out the prospect of a future in which U.S. carbon emissions are massively reduced, if not entirely eliminated, and clean, economical energy is readily available to all. That, surely, is an attractive vision. \n\nThe next step is resolving the details and mobilizing support from a broad range of individuals and groups. Both will be necessary to make progress, which the organizers of the Green New Deal recognize. âThe goal has always been to release a plan by January 2020 that will include all the major elements of a pathway to zero emissions,â Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the policy lead for the Green New Deal at New Consensus, a progressive policy group, told me. Gunn-Wright said she and her colleagues were making arrangements for extensive consultations with energy experts, environmental activists, and representatives of communities that would be impacted. âA green transformation will affect everyone,â she said, âso we think that everyone should be at the table in the policymaking process.â \n\nSome of the energy researchers I spoke with are already getting involved in that process. Griffith has been talking with people associated with Ocasio-Cortez, and last month he testified to a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Pollin is drafting a national plan, which he intends to submit to policymakers in Washington.  The rollout of the Green New Deal may have been troubled, but it has started something.\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7a4a08312cd3aa6c3d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Green New Deal","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"green-new-deal"},{"id":"5c2e1c77397f5b30646d05e6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"United Nations","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"united-nations"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a2710c62d1081540c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"alexandria-ocasio-cortez"},{"id":"5c2e1d4922d4972cd5b8334e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Renewable Energy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"renewable-energy"},{"id":"5c2e21b141e4c73c088d7ae0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Solar Energy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"solar-energy"},{"id":"5c2e316d2bc86f2c9a244e54","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wind Power","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wind-power"},{"id":"5c2e1ca122d4972cd5b832be","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bernie Sanders","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bernie-sanders"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

With her spookily unblinking blue eyes, sonorous, apparently fake baritone, and uniform of Steve Jobs-like black turtlenecks, Holmes is the kind of character whose rise-and-fall story is made especially riveting by her eccentricities, and Gibneyâs splashy documentary is widely anticipated. â9 day countdown for the Theranos documentary,â a friend posted on Twitter, on Sunday, followed by a series of emojis, including a bloody syringe and a heart-eyed face. Two days later, the same friend tweeted, âElizabeth Holmes is pissed she didnât think of this [college admissions scam](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/college-admissions-cheating-scandal.html) first.â\n\n \n\nAs my colleague Jia Tolentino [wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-fiends-and-the-folk-heroes-of-grifter-season) last Juneâafter the publication of â[Bad Blood,](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X)â John Carreyrouâs book about the Holmes affairâgrifter season comes irregularly but often in America. Its recurring arrival is marked by the appearance of fraudsters whose flagrant dishonesty captures the public imagination. Their stories allow us to vicariously live out our worst urges, but they also present us with open-and-shut arcs that show crime doesnât pay (in a world that, more often than not, suggests that it does). Our hunger for scam stories has lately seemed endless. In the past twelve months, weâve had not only Holmes but also [Anna Delvey](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html), the young Russian woman who scammed her way through New Yorkâs trendy and moneyed downtown circles, and Billy McFarland, the bro-ish entrepreneur whose [Fyre Fest fraud](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/searching-for-meaning-in-the-leftover-merchandise-of-fyre-festival) held so much public fascination that it was portrayed in not one but two documentaries this winter. The latest scandalâthe one that my friend was tweeting aboutâemerged on Tuesday, almost as if it were timed to serve as part of a viral-marketing strategy leading up to the Gibney documentary. (The tagline, if there was one, might have been, âYou like scams, remember?â)\n\n \n\nThis time, the target in question wasnât health care but college admissions. In a government investigation that began in 2011, and went by the appealingly retro name âOperation Varsity Blues,â more than thirty wealthy parents were charged with buying entry to a series of more or less selective schools for their academically middling children. Among the parents were C.E.O.s, a top lawyer, finance bigwigs, and even two Hollywood actors: Felicity Huffman, of the mid-two-thousands nighttime soap âDesperate Housewives,â and Lori Loughlin, of the popular nineties sitcom âFull House.â (Many of the parents have not yet entered pleas.) The people involved werenât odd birds, like Holmes, nor did they cloak their scamming, as she did, in lofty talk about the good of humanity. But, like the Theranos hoaxster, they were plenty wealthy, and appeared very comfortable with lying without compunction to get their way, and with throwing around hundreds of thousands of dollars in their quest to buy status. They were immediately fascinating characters to me: vulgar, entitled, and un-self-aware, they seemed to embody the latest version of the showy American id, not unlike Bravoâs Real Housewives, or the Kardashians, or, for that matter, the Trump family.\n\n \n\nAlong with the indictment, the Department of Justice released a two-hundred-and-four-page [affidavit](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/12/us/indictment-college-admissions-scheme/index.html), which contains the facts pertaining to the criminal complaint, including detailed records of communications between the accused parents and William Singer, who ran the scheme. As the owner of a college-admissions-consulting business in moneyed Newport Beach, California, Singer provided his clients with proctors and test administrators who helped falsify their usually unsuspecting childrenâs SAT and ACT scores, and he bribed college officials to recommend that prospective students be admitted to their institutions as athletes, even though they were nothing of the sort. In 2018, Singer became a witness for the government, and agreed to wear a wire; many of the conversations that are documented in the affidavit were recorded with his knowledge, after he was turned. (He is referred to in the document as âCW-1,â or âCooperating Witness 1\\.â)\n\n \n\nAs I read the documents, I wondered why perusing the minute interactions between Singer and his clients gave me so much pleasure. The people whose words are in the affidavitâsave for Singer, post-flipâthought they were doing something that would remain private. Part of what I was experiencing was the slightly gross excitement one feels when sneakily reading a diary: fulfilling the prurient fantasy of observing people behaving despicably, as they really are. But what captured my attention even more was the sheer everydayness of the documented conversations, whose polite blandness, in the context of their apparent criminality, often led to high comedy. In one moment, Loughlin expresses her happiness at her younger daughterâs fraudulent acceptance at the University of Southern California by texting Singer a high-five emoji. (Loughlin and her husband, the designer Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly paid Singer half a million dollars to help recruit their two daughters to U.S.C. as crew coxswains, though it is doubtful whether either had ever set foot in a rowboat.) Elsewhere, Huffman responds âawâ when Singer tells her that the crooked proctor who allegedly took the SATs for one of her daughters, in exchange for fifteen thousand dollars, had just had a baby; in another e-mail, she notifies Singer of a possible snag to the scheme, and writes, âRuh Ro!â A marketing C.E.O. provides Singer with a spidery handwriting sample from her son so that a proctor can ape it on the ACT, writing, dryly, âGood luck with this.â At one point, Singer has the face of a clientâs child crudely Photoshopped onto the body of a football player to convince an admissions committee that he is a worthy recruit. (He doesnât even play the sport.) When Singer tells two other clientsâone an impact investor at a private-equity firm, the other a casino-industry executiveâof some of the finer tricks of his scheme, they respond, repetitively, âI love it.â\n\n \n\nFor years, itâs been known that the college-admissions process itself is [a kind of scam](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-i-would-cover-the-college-admissions-scandal-as-a-foreign-correspondent). In his book â[The Price of Admission](https://www.amazon.com/Price-Admission-Americas-Colleges-Outside/dp/1400097975),â from 2006, the investigative journalist Daniel Golden reveals the ways in which wealthy parents secure their childrenâs acceptance to prestigious colleges through hefty donations. In one example, he describes how Charles and Seryl Kushner used a two-and-a-half-million-dollar donation to obtain an admission to Harvard for their son, Jared, who is now the Presidentâs son-in-law. (The Kushners have denied that the gift was related to Jaredâs admission.) In an [interview](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/an-investigative-journalist-on-how-parents-buy-college-admissions) with my colleague Isaac Chotiner, on Tuesday, Golden noted that, although participating in allegedly criminal activities, the parents involved in the current scandal were simply pushing an already corrupt system to its logical conclusion. There is no doubt of the continuity between the two types of admission schemes, and that the technically legal one isnât any more ethical than the other.\n\n \n\nThis weekâs exposure of the college-admissions scam is significant exactly because, in its trite ordinariness, it makes granular and concrete what is usually abstract and difficult to pin down. The parents who responded âI love itâ to Singerâs criminal propositions reminded me, viscerally, of Donald Trump, Jr.,âs breezy e-mail reply when, in 2016, he was told of a Russian sourceâs ability to share dirt on Hillary Clinton: âIf itâs what you say I love it.â When the e-mail was [revealed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/trump-russia-email-clinton.html), in 2017, I felt a similar satisfaction. In both cases, casual corruption, usually obscured by several layers of secrecy and legal trickery, was finally laid bare. The people involved were so self-satisfied and secure in their power that they greeted unethical, perhaps felonious proposals with complete nonchalance.\n\n \n\nA memorable passage in Carreyrouâs âBad Bloodâ describes how Tyler Shultz, a young employee at Theranos who ended up being one of the whistleblowers who brought down the company, finally gets to see what is inside the companyâs newfangled Edison deviceâtouted by Holmes as a miracle machine that will transform blood testing:\n\n \n\n> The device seemed to consist of nothing more than a pipette fastened\n> to a robotic arm that moved back and forth on a gantry. [Shultz and a\n> colleague] had envisioned some sort of sophisticated microfluidic\n> system. But this seemed like something a middle-schooler could build\n> in his garage.\n\n \n\nWhatâs inside the sleek machine is ugly and dumb and workaday. But the moment when the faÃ§ade is torn away from what lies beneath is also the moment when, one hopes, real change can begin.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1f9cee7fe02cbd1635d5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1f9cee7fe02cbd1635d5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"College

May marked the beginning of grifter season: the wind changed, the pressure dropped, and the scent of scamming was suddenly everywhere in the air. Anna Delvey, the young woman with messy hair and a vague European accent who allegedly convinced the superficial people and institutions of New York City night life that she was a millionaire heiress, was back in the public eye, thanks to an instant-classic [*New York* feature](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html) by Jessica Pressler. (Delvey is currently on Rikers Island, awaiting trial on charges of grand larceny and attempted grand larceny.) Elizabeth Holmes returned, too, in the pages of John Carreyrouâs new book, â[Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X),â which tells the story of Theranos, Holmesâs biotech company, which boasted of a miraculous blood-test technology that lived only in its founderâs imagination. (The company raised nearly a billion dollars from venture capitalists and private investors before Holmes was accused of fraud; she recently reached a settlement with the S.E.C., which required her to pay a fine and relinquish control of the company, among other penalties.) Elsewhere, Thomas J. Mace-Archer-Mills, Esq., a frequent media commentator on the British monarchy, was [revealed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-expert-on-the-royal-family-is-actually-tommy-from-upstate-new-york-1527775859) to be some guy from Albany named Tommy Muscatello, who had learned his British accent in a high-school production of âOliver.â A twenty-five-year-old was accused of [posing as an aristocrat explorer](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/the-mysterious-heir-of-extreme-travel-w520300) and scamming luxury tourists out of nearly seven hundred thousand dollars. A Colombian man [pleaded guilty](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/05/30/he-convinced-people-he-was-a-rich-saudi-prince-he-was-really-a-poor-street-kid-from-bogota/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.06fdba15164c) to fraud and identity theft after successfully pretending to be a Saudi prince for the past *three decades*. And Jill Stein, we learned, was doing exactly what we expected her to do with the seven million dollars that she raised for an election recount: [spending the money](https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-happened-to-jill-steins-recount-millions), largely in secret, without any recount having ever taken place. \n\nGrifter season comes irregularly, but it comes often in America, which is built around mythologies of profit and reinvention and spectacular ascent. The shady, audacious figures at its center exist on a spectrum, from folk hero to disgrace. The season begins when the public catches on to a series of scammers of a particularly appealing sortâthe kind who provoke both Schadenfreude and admiration. Not long before Presslerâs feature on Delvey appeared, my colleague Naomi Fry attended [a pop-up sale of Fyre Festival dead stock](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/searching-for-meaning-in-the-leftover-merchandise-of-fyre-festival): it was a foretoken, the grifter-season equivalent of a robin in the back yard in March. Fyre Festival was the handiwork of [Billy McFarland](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/fyre-festival-billy-mcfarland-millennial-marketing-fiasco), who, last year, advertised an Instagrammable music-festival extravaganza full of luxury beach palaces and models frolicking in the sand. To the eager twentysomethings who ponied up large amounts of money to be a part of this, he delivered *FEMA*{:.small}-style tents sitting on gravel and Styrofoam boxes of white bread and American cheese. It was a matryoshka doll of empty ambition: the attendees, like McFarland, seemed more interested in conveying a life style than embodying one. This is what made it so delicious, as a spectator. Previously, McFarlandâwho [pleaded guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/arts/organizer-of-failed-fyre-festival-pleads-guilty-to-fraud.html) to wire fraud this Marchâhad scammed the same kind of customer base through his company Magnises, which charged social-climbing New York professionals a monthly fee for access to a clubhouse, a lead on concert tickets that kept [mysteriously disappearing](http://www.businessinsider.com/magnises-complaints-from-members-2017-1), and a signature black card, which was intended to telegraph high status, even though it was, fittingly, just the userâs existing credit card with a fancied-up face.\n\nMcFarland, though he inspired vitriol, was also an inadvertent hero of the class war, embarrassing kids who felt entitled to indulgence, exposing the intertwined frauds of millennial-era wealth. Delvey has been celebrated as a sort of Bling Ring icon: her journey through the worlds of New York art and night life threw a spotlight on people who seem to have more money than substance, and on people who aspire to be like those people, as well as the companies that cater to all of them. Her friends, who became her marks, barely knew her: all she needed to do for them was pay for dinner, drop a few status signals, and persist in being around. The hotels that were so comfortable with rich young white women that they let Delvey stay for months without a credit card on file? They deserved to get fleeced, as did those who found themselves throwing thousands of dollars at a girl they sponged off but didnât actually know. Delvey, as one tweet put it, was a shining example of what a person could do after [overcoming impostor syndrome](https://twitter.com/juliareinstein/status/1001541661615325184). Her ridiculous ambitionâto build an enormous interactive consumer-art spaceâdiffered from many more famous New York ambitions mostly in that she failed. That she got so far without the smokescreen of extraordinary looks or taste endeared her further. Delveyâwho was born in Russia and later moved to Germany, and whose real last name is Sorokinâwas a perversely relatable striver: she was us, just with more energy (and, possibly, a knack for forging or repurposing bank documents).\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nâCons thrive in times of transition,â Maria Konnikova writes in her book â[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),â from 2016. The term âconfidence manâ was coined, in 1849, by the New York *Herald*, in pieces about a bumbling scammer who would ask strangers on the street, âHave you confidence in me to trust me with your watch until to-morrow?â At that point in American history, the gold rush was producing a swarm of swindlers in California, and free banking was enabling wildcat banks and counterfeiters to circulate worthless bills. Scammers love nothing better, Konnikova notes, than âexploiting the sense of unease we feel when it appears that the world as we know it is about to change.â One gets the sense, these days, that such unease may become constant: the entire globe is getting hotter, market pressures are accelerating, technology is advancing at a dizzying rate. At some point between the Great Recession, which began in 2008, and the terrible election of 2016, scamming seems to have become the dominant logic of American life. The things that people have historically used to build non-scammy lives in this countryâhousing, say, and higher educationâhave deteriorated to the point where they are likely to punish you if you are not already wealthy. The bankers pushing reverse mortgages, the recruiters at for-profit colleges, and the [many startup founders](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/technology/moviepass-economy-startups.html) hoping to take massive investor-backed losses until they eradicate the rest of the market understand the world better than we do. Thatâs part of the reason theyâre so riveting, down to the last detail. Scammers show us the glitzy bullshit intrinsic to stratospheric wealth in America; they show us that the best way to make money in this country is to treat everyone around you like a mark. \n\nBut we prefer a clean arc in our morality play: in the end, we like scammers most [when they fail](https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/03/us/malachi-love-robinson-arrest/index.html). The ones who seem like theyâve actually gotten away with somethingâsuch as Stein, who not only helped tip the election to the [definitive American scammer](https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-enduring-scandal-of-trump-university) of our age but who continued to profit from it after the factâarenât very fun. Like Stein, Holmes has not been the subject of much ironic idolatry, and this is partly, I think, because pleasure played no evident role in her extended scheming: she didnât go on vacation, she [ate like a robot](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/blood-simpler), she overengineered her voice and comportment in service of the exceedingly dry goal of resembling Steve Jobs. (Delvey and McFarland seem to better recognize that scamming means putting on a good show.) But itâs also, I suspect, because her downfall exposes a nauseating level of vulnerability and stupidity in our current way of living: Holmes ran Theranos on bluster and deception for more than a decade, and had Walgreens, Safeway, James Mattis, Rupert Murdoch, Betsy DeVos, David Boies, and a nine-billion-dollar valuation on her side. We want the failure of our scammers to seem inevitable, but Holmes reminds us of how many are likely still out thereâraising money, talking a big game at conferences, perhaps reading about Anna Delvey on a private jet.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cc236cecf4019214256","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Scams","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"scams"},{"id":"5c2e1ca736cecf4019214223","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fraud","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fraud"},{"id":"5c2e1de92396212cbb9fcae3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Theranos","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"theranos"},{"id":"5c2e1de92710c62d108155ad","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elizabeth Holmes","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elizabeth-holmes"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef00ebe912338a37171f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cultural Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cultural-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590b497fdd6207318b5dadaa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jia Tolentino is a staff writer at *The New Yorker* whose recent work includes an [exploration of youth vaping](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/the-promise-of-vaping-and-the-rise-of-juul) and essays on the ongoing cultural reckoning about sexual assault.

According to the indictments, [dozens of rich and well-connected parents](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-college-admissions-scandal-and-the-banality-of-scamming), including two television stars, participated in a criminal scheme run by William Singer, the founder of a college preparatory and counselling business. Singer allegedly helped his clients to insure their childrenâs admission to selective colleges by bribing university staff and coaches to misrepresent their children as athletes or by recruiting administrators and proctors to help falsify their childrenâs scores on admissions tests. The schools targeted included Yale, Stanford, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and more; the uproar over the story, and the lengths that the government claims the parents went to, suggest that college admissions, especially at Ã©lite schools, continue to be [a topic of immense interest and angst](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-i-would-cover-the-college-admissions-scandal-as-a-foreign-correspondent). \n\nTo discuss the scandal, I spoke by phone with Daniel Golden, the author of the 2006 book â[The Price of Admission: How Americaâs Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Collegesâand Who Gets Left Outside the Gates](https://www.amazon.com/Price-Admission-Americas-Colleges-Outside/dp/1400097975).â Currently a senior editor at ProPublica, Golden showed how the wealthiest parents, including [Jared Kushner](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jared-kushner)âs, have wheeled and dealed their way into gaining admission for their children, often via large gifts to their university of choice. My conversation with Golden about todayâs blockbuster story and its larger meaning, which has been edited for clarity and length, is below. \n\n__How does this scandal change, if it does change, your understanding of the larger issue that your book addresses?__ \n\nI think that itâs kind of a logical outgrowth of the scandal that my book exposed. What my book showed was that the rich and famous exploit the college-admissions system by using private college counsellors who serve as conduits for donations, by benefitting from the various admissions preferences, like the preference for athletes, because there are so many patrician sports in which their kids participate, like crew or sailing or fencing or equestrian events. In this case, they take it to the extreme, through pretense. Normally, students from rich families benefit from athletic preference because they actually row crew or sail or fence, which is a preference in itself, because those sports are not played at most inner-city high schools. But here the kids did not even engage in those activities. Instead, it was a sham.\n\nSimilarly, the private college counsellor here went beyond all the bounds of accepted behavior, if we can believe the allegations. He didnât just facilitate the admission by hinting to college officials that the family might be inclined to be philanthropic if the kid was accepted. Instead, he appears to have flat-out bribed test administrators and college coaches and the like. They pushed, to the fullest extent, an unfair system that has been in place for a long time. Itâs the fantasy, extreme version of an endemic problem.\n\n__When you say that itâs been in place for a long time, does that mean since American colleges were founded, or was there a golden era when this stuff was not going on?__ \n\nI donât think there was ever a golden era. College admissions has evolved over the years. Initially, back before there were standardized-test scores, and when Ã©lite schools, like Harvard, mostly recruited from their own areas, they just straightforwardly preferred candidates from wealthy, well-established families. But then there were various efforts towards meritocracy, like standardized tests, and the system we have now. And there was also entry by high-achieving groups, like Jews, that the colleges didnât want to let in, in perhaps the numbers that they deserved. \n\nSo, in response to the pressure for meritocracy, this crazy-quilt complicated system developed, which appears, on the surface, to be merit-based but actually includes quite a few hidden boosts for the wealthy. And that system has been in place for some decades. But itâs post-World War II.\n\n__Do you have reason to think that this sort of thing we saw with the indictments today has been going on for a long time, and, if it is increasing, why might it be increasing?__ \n\nI donât know if this kind of criminal activity is widespread. There are widespread practices that are unfair and benefit the wealthy. One of the puzzles of this case is: Why did these families bother to go to this extreme? Why did they pay so much money to fake their kids having athletic preference, or have somebody else take their tests? Why didnât they simply contribute a lot of money to the university? Maybe their kids were so far underqualified that they couldnât get in no matter how much was donated. Or, possibly, it was less expensive for them to pay these kinds of bribes. But there are so many advantages anyway, and giving money usually meets such a receptive audience, that it is a little puzzling why they would have to engage in this kind of criminal activity.\n\n__Colleges obviously still rely a lot on legacy admissions. Are they relying on it less than a decade or two ago, and might this lessening be causing legacy admissions or the rich and famous to be more desperate to get their kids in by any means necessary?__ \n\nActually, regarding legacy admissions, whatâs happened in the last couple decades is two contrasting things. The first is that, yes, the percentage of legacies admitted has declined. Itâs less of a guarantee of admission than it used to be. On the other hand, the over-all acceptance rate at these Ã©lite schools has declined even more. So legacy, proportionally, is a bigger advantage than it once was. If you take a typical Ivy League school, maybe twenty or thirty years ago, they might admit two-thirds of legacy applicants. Now they might admit one-third of legacy applicants. But, at the same time, their over-all acceptance rate has probably gone down from between twenty and twenty-five per cent to between five and ten per cent. So, proportionally, being a legacy is even more of an advantage. But, in any particular case, a legacy is less likely to get in than they used to.\n\nNow, the pressures over all are generally working a little bit the other way. They are working for the benefit of donors rather than to their detriment. Whatâs happened is that other sources of income for universities have stayed level or declined. The percentage of small, grassroots donorsâalumni who give a little bitâhas declined, and universities are more dependent on big donations, the kind that often carry a kind of admissions tit for tat. Similarly, there hasnât been big growth in terms of federal funding for research and other sources of income for universities. So universities are actually more dependent on big gifts than ever before, or at least in recent memory, and, as a result, donors are even more in the driverâs seat. \n\n__Did you have any other takeaways from the story today?__\n\nThe other thing that is interesting is that, in my book, I wrote about preferences not just for the rich but for celebritiesâhow Brown University had gained buzz by admitting the kids of celebrities. \n\n__I assume celebrities are rich?__\n\nItâs sort of a separate preference. Itâs an additional benefit. They might not be hugely rich, but they have a kind of cachet. There might be someone at Goldman Sachs who is worth ten times as much as a television personality. But there is a cachet to having the kid of a television personality. I thought it was interesting, in that regard, that this case involved both the traditionally richâchief executives and securities investorsâand television actresses. My book focussed on those groups as somewhat separate, overlapping but distinct. \n\n__Is there anything you think your book got wrong or understated?__\n\nI think the general themes were right on point, and I donât think itâs because I was so brilliant. I think itâs because this was a system that was hidden in plain view and was in front of your nose if only you looked, and also because it was so offensive to most peopleâs idea of what America is about. The fundamental ethos of America is equal opportunity and upward mobility and everybody gets a chance. The people who perform the best are supposed to rise to the top, and college education is supposed to be the driving force in upward mobility. So the idea that the wealthy can perpetuate their own privileged status through college admissions, that itâs not an equal gateway for everybody but a way to perpetuate American aristocracy, is a real affront to people. And thatâs the resonance a case like this has.\n\n__The *Timesâ* Ross Douthat had a long Twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/DouthatNYT/status/1105542339576107010) about this, in which he wrote, in part, âThis is not proof that meritocracy is somehow âbroken.â Quite the reverse: It shows that the desire to claim some measured âmeritâ to legitimize success extends to parents who by merely financial measures donât need the Ivy stamp to ensure their kidsâ success. Like âJames Gatzâ becoming âJay Gatsbyâ in the Main Line/social-register dispensation, a CEO or TV star buying an Ivy admission and even a fake test score for their lackluster scion is the homage that mere money plays to the gods of the resume and the SAT.â What do you think of that?__\n\nI think itâs nicely written. And I also think that he is correct in saying that the perceived value of an Ivy League degree goes beyond money. It does have to do with social status and bragging rights and an aristocratic identification. So I think thatâs true.\n\nAlso, there are a lot of debates about how much an Ivy League degree affects financial gain in future years, and I donât pretend to know or even understand the math on which those debates are based. All I can say is that some people are extremely desirous of an Ivy League degree. Itâs easy for people on the outside to say, âWhat does it matter if your kid went to the Ivy League or School X?,â but it does seem to matter an awful lot to an awful lot of people. If you look at the hallways of power in our societyâthe U.S. Senate, the Supreme Court, places like thatâyou will find a lot of people with undergraduate or graduate degrees from Ã©lite schools. \n\nI also think that, often in our society, the great entrepreneurs, the great originators of success, are not necessarily Ivy League graduates. They may be dropouts like Bill Gates or people who didnât go to college at all, or went to a school that doesnât have as high a reputation. But then they often want to cement that status by making their family a permanent part of whatever passes for aristocracy in America, and they often see the Ivy League degree that they didnât get themselves as the imprimatur for their children or grandchildren. You will often see at these Ivy League the second or third generations of a great business family rather than the first generation.

The network, which had previously limited its scope to the local sphereââthe people around you,â in the [language](https://observer.com/2009/07/the-evolution-of-facebooks-mission-statement/) of a tagline the previous yearâabruptly moved to reach its arms around the planet. âFacebook gives people the power to share and make the world more open and connected,â the new version said. The scaling up was considerable, a bit like the difference between hosting thirty people for Thanksgiving dinner and trying to feed turkey to the whole world. But for a good long while its promise seemed possible. In 2011, Facebook, along with other social networks, became an enabling technology of the Arab Spring. By 2013, four years after the wider mission statement circulated, the platformâs monthly active users had [more than quadrupled](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/). At some point, it was discovered that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebookâs chairman and C.E.O., was going around with the âopen and connectedâ phrase [emblazoned on the inside of his hoodie](https://mashable.com/2010/06/04/facebook-insignia/#ThFfxU6RDOqW), and who could blame him for that quiet mark of pride? It is one thing to talk about openness and connection, another to make real strides in bringing the world close.\n\nThat era, and that dream, just ended. For months, there have been rumors of Facebook preparing a major âpivotâ toward messenger services. On Wednesday, in [a blog post](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/), Zuckerberg officially called the turn. âI believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure,â he wrote. Facebook, from now on, will begin moving away from the sorts of functions that most everyday users associate with it: publishing widely shared posts and visibly cementing contact with friends, passing acquaintances, chatty academics, classmates not contacted in twenty years, and weirdos with a point of viewâconnections that Zuckerberg cast as the domain of âpublic social networks.â Instead, he explained in his announcement, the company would present a âsimpler platformâ oriented toward sharing information privately with designated recipients. âFacebook and Instagram have helped people connect with friends, communities, and interests in the digital equivalent of a town square,â he wrote. âBut people increasingly also want to connect privately in the digital equivalent of the living room.â\n\nThe turn marks the companyâs largest mission change in a decade, strategically on scale with I.B.M. announcing, in 2005, that it would stop selling personal computers. But the Facebook shift is far more influential, because, unlike I.B.M.âs home tech, the network has been used by [sixty-eight per cent](http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/) of adults in the United States. Zuckerberg envisioned bringing Facebookâs messaging service together with those of Instagram and WhatsApp, which it also owns, creating a single point-to-point communications network largely hidden from public view. Under this new model, the value and defining use of Facebook would be the online infrastructure that it has assembled, not the stage that it provides. Zuckerberg emphasized the new âprivateâ platformâs potential for commerce. âYou can imagine many simple experiences,â he wrote. âA person discovers a business on Instagram and easily transitions to their preferred messaging app for secure payments and customer support.â\n\nThe reasons for the change of emphasis are clear enough. Over the past year, Facebook has been subject to [an almost uncountable number of scandals](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-scandals-2018/)âsome small, some enormous, some internal, and others terrifyingly close to the foundations of American democracy. Most have stemmed from privacy, whether because users thought they had more of it than they did or simply because, by virtue of spreading privately created information to a vast public, Facebook entered posterior-first into the broadcast sphere. Wednesdayâs announcement showed a company eager to get out of the information game and more directly into the transaction gameâto do openly, in other words, what itâs been doing obliquely for years. \n\nBy some measures, that shift is welcome news. Facebookâs unholy brew of information and commerce has underlain the platformâs recent trouble. It has also overtaken other industriesâmost prominently news and publishingâthat used to have that tricky intersection to themselves. Facebookâs role as a channel of partisan misinformation has been considerable, if sometimes disproportionately blamed. (A [recent Pew survey](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/10/social-media-outpaces-print-newspapers-in-the-u-s-as-a-news-source/) found that half of Americans get most of their news from TV; only a fifth get it from social media.) It has doubled the damage, too, by co-opting many of the advertising and distribution channels that historically made respectable publishing operations sustainable as businesses. Because Facebookâs algorithms determined who saw what, and because its advertising siphoned off many of the spoils of holding audience attention, the Fourth Estate has spent the past decade under the platformâs yoke. It is not yet clear how Living Room Facebook will affect this dynamicâmostly because itâs not yet clear exactly how Living Room Facebook will workâbut there is reason for mild hope. A social platform that is more like texting and less like browsing is harder to mistake for the newsstand. \n\nZuckerbergâs post, which was, especially for Zuckerberg, long, took pains to sell the idea that a turn toward private communication was a turn toward privacy itself. âEnd-to-end encryption is an important tool in developing a privacy-focused social network,â he wrote. âIt limits services like ours from seeing the content flowing through them.â The other side of this coin, of course, is that the nature of the network itself grows intrinsically less transparentâa modest gain for users but a major one for Facebook, whose [shady doings and usage patterns](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/facebook-woes-a-timeline-of-scandals-plaguing-zuckerbergs-company) came to light largely through the fishbowl nature of the platform. Zuckerberg lamented what he called the âpermanence problemâ: the knowledge that what is on the Internet usually stays on the Internet. He instead imagined the future of Facebook as being something like the past of Snapchat: materials could automatically vanish after a fixed period. We are all nude-selfie-sharing teens now, sending short-lived private missives to specific individuals across the world network and hoping for the best. This used to be called mail. \n\nThe odd thing about Facebookâs new vision for the future, in fact, is how old it seemsâhow much itâs a backpedalling from the curious adventure of the past ten years. As Iâve [mentioned](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/06/private-dreams-and-public-ideals-in-san-francisco) in the magazine, I happen to have been around during Facebookâs first days, at Harvard (founding slogan: âThefacebook is an online directory that connects people through social networks at collegesâ), and what I remember of the platform then was its cozy, clannish, inside-joke smallness. It seemed funâand safeâprecisely because it wasnât a true social network, like MySpace or Friendster at the time. It was private; it was woven into real, near life. You could post your favorite music to project the coolness you mysteriously failed to conjure while studying your chemistry books in the dorm cafeteria. You could âpokeâ someone as a follow-up to a vaguely flirtatious conversation before class. \n\nThat is what we needed as callow nineteen-year-olds trying to cling together, and to the familiar, in an imperious and (to many of us) disconcertingly Ã©lite place. Itâs the opposite of an unguent for what ails the world today. Looking out across a global society filled with people getting headlines from like-minded friends, chanting slogans to their personal tribes, and watching last yearâs Netflix series on their laptops in the dark, it is hard to make the case that our most urgent need is further private channelling. Facebook may have failed as a town square, but all of us, its users, still need ours. In many ways that matter, weâre more desperate for open connection today than weâve ever been before.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Facebook","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark

of Facebook, [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg), published a thirty-two-hundred-word [post on his site](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/) titled âA privacy-focused vision for social networking,â a new study from the market research firm Edison Research revealed that [Facebook had lost fifteen million users](https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/tech/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions) in the United States since 2017. âFifteen million is a lot of people, no matter which way you cut it,â Larry Rosin, the president of Edison Research, said on American Public Mediaâs âMarketplace.â âThis is the second straight year weâve seen this number go down.â The trend is likely related to the publicâs dawning recognition that Facebook has become both an unbridled surveillance tool and a platform for propaganda and misinformation. According to a recent [Harris/Axios](https://www.axios.com/facebook-reputation-drops-axios-harris-poll-0d6c406a-4c2e-463a-af98-1748d3e0ab9a.html) survey of the hundred most visible companies in the U.S., Facebookâs reputation has taken a precipitous dive in the last five years, with its most acute plunge in the past year, and it scores particularly low in the categories of citizenship, ethics, and trust.\n\nWhile Zuckerbergâs blog post can be read as a response to this loss of faith, it is also a strategic move to capitalize on [the social-media platformâs failures](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/facebooks-very-bad-month-just-got-worse). To be clear, what Zuckerberg calls âtown squareâ Facebook, where people post updates about new jobs, and share prom pictures and erroneous information about vaccines, will continue to exist. (On Thursday, Facebook [announced](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/07/facebook-anti-vaxx-vaccine-hoax-ads) that it would ban anti-vaccine advertisements on the site.) His new vision is to create a separate product that merges Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram into an encrypted and interoperable communications platform that will be more like a âliving room.â According to Zuckerberg, âWeâve worked hard to build privacy into all our products, including those for public sharing. But one great property of messaging services is that, even as your contacts list grows, your individual threads and groups remain private. As your friends evolve over time, messaging services evolve gracefully and remain intimate.â\n\nThis new Facebook promises to store data securely in the cloud, and delete messages after a set amount of time to reduce âthe risk of your messages resurfacing and embarrassing you later.â (Apparently, Zuckerberg already uses this feature, as [Tech Crunch reported](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages), in April, 2018.) Its interoperability means, for example, that users will be able to buy something from Facebook Marketplace and communicate with the seller via WhatsApp; Zuckerberg says this will enable the buyer to avoid sharing a phone number with a stranger. Just last week, however, [a user discovered](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-phone-number-that-secures-your-facebook-account-isnt-as-safe-as-you-think-2019-03-04) that phone numbers provided for two-factor authentication on Facebook can be used to track people across the Facebook universe. Zuckerberg does not address how the new product will handle this feature, since âtown squareâ Facebook will continue to exist.\n\nOnce Facebook has merged all of its products, the company plans to build other products on top of it, including payment portals, banking services, and, not surprisingly, advertising. In an [interview with *Wiredâs*](https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-privacy-pivot/) editor-in-chief, Nicholas Thompson, Zuckerberg explained that âWhat Iâm trying to lay out is a privacy-focused vision for this kind of platform that starts with messaging and making that as secure as possible with end-to-end encryption, and then building all of the other kinds of private and intimate ways that you would want to interactâfrom calling, to groups, to stories, to payments, to different forms of commerce, to sharing location, to eventually having a more open-ended system to plug in different kinds of tools for providing the interaction with people in all the ways that you would want.â \n\nIf this sounds familiar, it is. Zuckerbergâs concept borrows liberally from WeChat, the multiverse Chinese social-networking platform, popularly known as Chinaâs â[app for everything](https://the-parallax.com/2018/06/21/meet-wechat-everything-app-china/).â WeChatâs billion monthly active users employ the app for texting, video conferencing, broadcasting, money transfers, paying fines, and making medical appointments. Privacy, however, is not one of its attributes. According to a 2015 article in [*Quartz*](https://qz.com/518908/wechats-new-heat-map-feature-lets-users-and-chinese-authorities-see-where-crowds-are-forming/), WeChatâs âheat mapâ feature alerts Chinese authorities to unusual crowds of people, which the government can then surveil.\n\nZuckerberg is quick to point out that his vision for this new Facebook is aspirational. It has not yet been built, and it is not certain that it *can* be builtâat least in the way he imagines itâwith across-the-board encryption. âI believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content wonât stick around forever,â Zuckerberg tells us. âThis is the future I hope we will help bring about.â By announcing it now, and framing it in terms of privacy, he appears to be addressing the concerns of both users and regulators, while failing to acknowledge that a consolidated Facebook will provide advertisers with an even richer and more easily accessed database of users than the site currently offers. As [*Wired* reported](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/facebook-whatsapp-merger) in January, when the merger of Facebookâs apps was floated in the press, âthe move will unlock huge quantities of user information that was previously locked away in silos.â ( As Privacy Matters recently [noted](https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters/status/1052562585223073793) on Twitter, Facebookâs data policy states, âWe collect information about the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups that you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or groups that you are part of.â)\n\nZuckerberg also acknowledged that an encrypted Facebook may pose problems for law enforcement and intelligence services, but promised that the company would work with authorities to root out bad guys who âmisuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion.â Itâs unclear how, with end-to-end encryption, it will be able to do this. Facebookâs private groups have already been used to incite genocide and other acts of violence, suppress voter turnout, and disseminate misinformation. Its pivot to privacy will not only give such activities more space to operate behind the relative shelter of a digital wall but will also relieve Facebook from the responsibility of policing them. Instead of moreâand more exactingâcontent moderation, there will be less. Instead of removing bad actors from the service, the pivot to privacy will give them a safe harbor. \n\nIf âtown squareâ Facebook is, as Zuckerberg and his associates like to say, âa neutral platform,â this new âliving roomâ Facebook, where people gather in smallish, obscure groups, is likely to be a broadcast channel for all sorts of odious and malevolent ideas and behaviors. Weâve seen this already on WhatsApp. Last year, mobs in India were incited to kill more than two dozen innocent people after false rumors of a child-kidnapping ring were spread through the messaging app. As the New York *Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/technology/whatsapp-india-killings.html) at the time, âWhatsAppâs design makes it easy to spread false information. Many messages are shared in groups, and when they are forwarded, there is no indication of their origin.â (According to the *Times,* WhatsApp subsequently introduced new labels for forwarded messages, ran newspaper ads to warn the public about misinformation, and vowed to work more closely with police.) Instagram has also been an effective tool for spreading misinformation. According to data shared with the Senate Intelligence Committee last December, between [2015 and 2017](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tech-giants-have-done-bare-minimum-to-help-russia-investigation-senate-intel-committee-told), Russian propagandists working out of the Internet Research Agency generated posts that garnered a hundred and eighty-seven million interactions on the photo-sharing app, which was more engagement than they accomplished on either Facebook or Twitter. An encrypted Instagram will be a boon to trolls.\n\nLast week, the relentless British journalist Carole Cadwalladr, along with her colleague Duncan Campbell, [reported in the *Observer*](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment) that Facebook has been pressuring politicians around the world to lobby against imposing regulations on the social network, offering investments and other incentives. (A Facebook spokesperson told the *Observer* that the documents forming the basis of the reporting were âcherrypicked.â) In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is considering whether to fine Facebook billions of dollars for violating a 2011 consent decree intended to protect usersâ private data. In Wednesdayâs announcement, Zuckerberg, who is famous for shambling apologies, seemed to have finally run out of mea culpas. âI understand that many people donât think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform,â he wrote, âbecause frankly we donât currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services.â On that point, at least, heâs right.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f2bfcc72cd92d0533","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Data Privacy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"data-privacy"},{"id":"5c2e1e0bee7fe02cbd1634ba","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"WhatsApp","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"whatsapp"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e36cecf40192141db","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Instagram","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"instagram"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f161ebe912338a3717da","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"Tech","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5ac2e2e17730741c5fa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sue Halpern, a contributing writer covering politics and technology, has been writing for *The New Yorker* since 2005.

The most recent, published on Wednesday, outlines âa privacy-focused vision for social networking.â âPublic social networks will continue to be very important in peopleâs lives,â Zuckerberg writes. But âthe future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services.â He hopes to build such platforms, and expand the ones the company already owns. He isnât proposing to dismantle Facebook as it currently exists. The Facebook to come, he explains, will facilitate âprivate interactionsâ; it will feature âreduced permanence,â with content disappearing automatically, Snapchat-style; it will allow for messages, video chats, monetary transactions, and âother kinds of private servicesâ that are encrypted âend-to-end.â (This type of encryption âprevents anyoneâincluding usâfrom seeing what people share,â Zuckerberg explains.)  Zuckerberg wants to supplement âthe platforms weâve already built to help people share and connect more openlyâ with âplatforms for private sharing.â The idea is to let you use Facebook in secret.\n\nThe move toward privacy seems designed to respond to a number of problems. To some extent, it responds to Facebookâs content-moderation problem: if a conversation that violates the companyâs âcommunity guidelinesâ is encrypted, such that even Facebookâs software canât read it, then the company canât be expected to expunge it. It responds to the Ralph Northam-yearbook problem (âPeople want to know that what they share wonât come back to hurt them laterâ), since, by default, content will auto-delete.  And it responds to the China problem, as Zuckerberg vows ânot to build data centers in countries that have a track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression.â It also attempts to address Facebookâs public-relations problem: after a scandalous year, fewer people trust the network than ever.\n\nWhat it does not and cannot address is the social-media problem. That problem, essentially, is centralization. Itâs extraordinary that one companyâand, to an extent, one personâhas the power to reshape the way that billions of people communicate, not just once but over and over again. In its original incarnation, Facebook helped turn ordinary people into broadcasters; this had predictable, desirable consequences (baby photos; gratitude challenges; rainbow-hued demonstrations of solidarity) and unpredictable, disastrous ones (harassment; anti-vaxxers; Russian trolls). Almost certainly, Facebookâs privacy initiatives will result in good and bad outcomes that are hard to predictâand those outcomes, whatever they are, will unfold at a massive, global scale, affecting societies around the world simultaneously. That scale, in itself, is a problemâone that Facebook will never solve.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c78ee7fe02cbd163327","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Privacy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"privacy"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e5e72179605b11ad9914","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Joshua RothmanÂ is *The New Yorkerâs* archive editor.

class="ArticleBody__articleBody___1GSGP"><div><div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>In <span data-page="page_1"></span>1964, during a lecture at Cornell University, the physicist Richard Feynman articulated a profound mystery about the physical world. He told his listeners to imagine two objects, each gravitationally attracted to the other. How, he asked, should we predict their movements? Feynman identified three approaches, each invoking a different belief about the world. The first approach used Newtonâs law of gravity, according to which the objects exert a pull on each other. The second imagined a gravitational field extending through space, which the objects distort. The third applied the principle of least action, which holds that each object moves by following the path that takes the least energy in the least time. All three approaches produced the same, correct prediction. They were three equally useful descriptions of how gravity works.</p><p>âOne of the amazing characteristics of nature is this variety of interpretational schemes,â Feynman said. Whatâs more, this multifariousness applies only to the <em class="">true</em> laws of natureâit doesnât work if the laws are misstated. âIf you modify the laws much, you find you can only write them in fewer ways,â Feynman said. âI always found that mysterious, and I do not know the reason why it is that the correct laws of physics are expressible in such a tremendous variety of ways. They seem to be able to get through several wickets at the same time.â</p><p>Even as physicists work to understand the material content of the universeâthe properties of particles, the nature of the big bang, the origins of dark matter and dark energyâtheir work is shadowed by this Rashomon effect, which raises metaphysical questions about the meaning of physics and the nature of reality. Nima Arkani-Hamed, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study, is one of todayâs leading theoreticians. âThe miraculous shape-shifting property of the laws is the single most amazing thing I know about them,â he told me, this past fall. It âmust be a huge clue to the nature of the ultimate truth.â</p><p>Traditionally, physicists have been reductionists. Theyâve searched for a âtheory of everythingâ that describes reality in terms of its most fundamental components. In this way of thinking, the known laws of physics are provisional, approximating an as-yet-unknown, more detailed description. A table is <em class="">really</em> a collection of atoms; atoms, upon closer inspection, reveal themselves to be clusters of protons and neutrons; each of these is, more microscopically, a trio of quarks; and quarks, in turn, are presumed to consist of something yet more fundamental. Reductionists think that they are playing a game of telephone: as the message of reality travels upward, from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale, it becomes garbled, and they must work their way downward to recover the truth. Physicists now know that gravity wrecks this naÃ¯ve scheme, by shaping the universe on both large and small scales. And the Rashomon effect also suggests that reality isnât structured in such a reductive, bottom-up way.</p><p>If anything, Feynmanâs example understated the mystery of the Rashomon effect, which is actually twofold. Itâs strange that, as Feynman says, there are multiple valid ways of describing so many physical phenomena. But an even stranger fact is that, when there are competing descriptions, one often turns out to be more true than the others, because it extends to a deeper or more general description of reality. Of the three ways of describing objectsâ motion, for instance, the approach that turns out to be more true is the underdog: the principle of least action. In everyday reality, itâs strange to imagine that objects move by âchoosingâ the easiest path. (How does a falling rock know which trajectory to take before it gets going?) But, a century ago, when physicists began to make experimental observations about the strange behavior of elementary particles, only the least-action interpretation of motion proved conceptually compatible. A whole new mathematical languageâquantum mechanicsâhad to be developed to describe particlesâ probabilistic ability to play out all possibilities and take the easiest path most frequently. Of the various classical laws of motionâall workable, all usefulâonly the principle of least action also extends to the quantum world.</p><p>It happens again and again that, when there are many possible descriptions of a physical situationâall making equivalent predictions, yet all wildly different in premiseâone will turn out to be preferable, because it extends to an underlying reality, seeming to account for more of the universe at once. And yet this new description might, in turn, have multiple formulationsâand one of those alternatives may apply even more broadly. Itâs as though physicists are playing a modified telephone game in which, with each whisper, the message is translated into a different language. The languages describe different scales or domains of the same reality but arenât always related etymologically. In this modified game, the objective isnâtâor isnât onlyâto seek a bedrock equation governing realityâs smallest bits. The existence of this branching, interconnected web of mathematical languages, each with its own associated picture of the world, is what needs to be understood.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>This web of laws creates traps for physicists. Suppose youâre a researcher seeking to understand the universe more deeply. You may get stuck using a dead-end descriptionâclinging to a principle that seems correct but is merely one of natureâs disguises. Itâs for this reason that Paul Dirac, a British pioneer of quantum theory, stressed the importance of reformulating existing theories: itâs by finding new ways of<span data-page="page_final"></span> describing known phenomena that you can escape the trap of provisional or limited belief. This was the trick that led Dirac to predict antimatter, in 1928. âIt is not always so that theories which are equivalent are equally good,â he said, five decades later, âbecause one of them may be more suitable than the other for future developments.â</p><p>Today, various puzzles and paradoxes point to the need to reformulate the theories of modern physics in a new mathematical language. Many physicists feel trapped. They have a hunch that they need to transcend the notion that objects move and interact in space and time. Einsteinâs general theory of relativity beautifully weaves space and time together into a four-dimensional fabric, known as space-time, and equates gravity with warps in that fabric. But Einsteinâs theory and the space-time concept break down inside black holes and at the moment of the big bang. Space-time, in other words, may be a translation of some other description of reality that, though more abstract or unfamiliar, can have greater explanatory power.</p><p>Some researchers are attempting to wean physics off of space-time in order to pave the way toward this deeper theory. Currently, to predict how particles morph and scatter when they collide in space-time, physicists use a complicated diagrammatic scheme invented by Richard Feynman. The so-called Feynman diagrams indicate the probabilities, or âscattering amplitudes,â of different particle-collision outcomes. In 2013, Nima Arkani-Hamed and Jaroslav Trnka discovered a reformulation of scattering amplitudes that makes reference to neither space nor time. They found that the amplitudes of certain particle collisions are encoded in the volume of a jewel-like geometric object, which they dubbed the amplituhedron. Ever since, they and dozens of other researchers have been exploring this new geometric formulation of particle-scattering amplitudes, hoping that it will lead away from our everyday, space-time-bound conception to some grander explanatory structure.</p><p>Whether these researchers are on the right track or not, the web of explanations of reality exists. Perhaps the most striking thing about those explanations is that, even as each draws only a partial picture of reality, they are mathematically perfect. Take general relativity. Physicists know that Einsteinâs theory is incomplete. Yet it is a spectacular artifice, with a spare, taut mathematical structure. Fiddle with the equations even a little and you lose all of its beauty and simplicity. It turns out that, if you want to discover a deeper way of explaining the universe, you canât take the equations of the existing description and subtly deform them. Instead, you must make a jump to a totally different, equally perfect mathematical structure. Whatâs the point, theorists wonder, of the perfection found at every level, if itâs bound to be superseded?</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>It seems inconceivable that this intricate web of perfect mathematical descriptions is random or happenstance. This mystery must have an explanation. But what might such an explanation look like? One common conception of physics is that its laws are like a machine that humans are building in order to predict what will happen in the future. The âtheory of everythingâ is like the ultimate prediction machineâa single equation from which everything follows. But this outlook ignores the existence of the many different machines, built in all manner of ingenious ways, that give us equivalent predictions.</p><p>To Arkani-Hamed, the multifariousness of the laws suggests a different conception of what physics is all about. Weâre not building a machine that calculates answers, he says; instead, weâre discovering questions. Natureâs shape-shifting laws seem to be the answer to an unknown mathematical question. This is why Arkani-Hamed and his colleagues find their studies of the amplituhedron so promising. Calculating the volume of the amplituhedron is a question in geometryâone that mathematicians might have pondered, had they discovered the object first. Somehow, the answer to the question of the amplituhedronâs volume describes the behavior of particlesâand that answer, in turn, can be rewritten in terms of space and time.</p><p>Arkani-Hamed now sees the ultimate goal of physics as figuring out the mathematical question from which all the answers flow. âThe ascension to the tenth level of intellectual heaven,â he told me, âwould be if we find the question to which the universe is the answer, and the nature of that question in and of itself explains why it was possible to describe it in so many different ways.â Itâs as though physics has been turned inside out. It now appears that the answers already surround us. Itâs the question we donât know.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div

a lecture at Cornell University, the physicist Richard Feynman articulated a profound mystery about the physical world. He told his listeners to imagine two objects, each gravitationally attracted to the other. How, he asked, should we predict their movements? Feynman identified three approaches, each invoking a different belief about the world. The first approach used Newtonâs law of gravity, according to which the objects exert a pull on each other. The second imagined a gravitational field extending through space, which the objects distort. The third applied the principle of least action, which holds that each object moves by following the path that takes the least energy in the least time. All three approaches produced the same, correct prediction. They were three equally useful descriptions of how gravity works."],["p","âOne of the amazing characteristics of nature is this variety of interpretational schemes,â Feynman said. Whatâs more, this multifariousness applies only to the ",["em","true"]," laws of natureâit doesnât work if the laws are misstated. âIf you modify the laws much, you find you can only write them in fewer ways,â Feynman said. âI always found that mysterious, and I do not know the reason why it is that the correct laws of physics are expressible in such a tremendous variety of ways. They seem to be able to get through several wickets at the same time.â"],["p","Even as physicists work to understand the material content of the universeâthe properties of particles, the nature of the big bang, the origins of dark matter and dark energyâtheir work is shadowed by this Rashomon effect, which raises metaphysical questions about the meaning of physics and the nature of reality. Nima Arkani-Hamed, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study, is one of todayâs leading theoreticians. âThe miraculous shape-shifting property of the laws is the single most amazing thing I know about them,â he told me, this past fall. It âmust be a huge clue to the nature of the ultimate truth.â"],["p","Traditionally, physicists have been reductionists. Theyâve searched for a âtheory of everythingâ that describes reality in terms of its most fundamental components. In this way of thinking, the known laws of physics are provisional, approximating an as-yet-unknown, more detailed description. A table is ",["em","really"]," a collection of atoms; atoms, upon closer inspection, reveal themselves to be clusters of protons and neutrons; each of these is, more microscopically, a trio of quarks; and quarks, in turn, are presumed to consist of something yet more fundamental. Reductionists think that they are playing a game of telephone: as the message of reality travels upward, from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale, it becomes garbled, and they must work their way downward to recover the truth. Physicists now know that gravity wrecks this naÃ¯ve scheme, by shaping the universe on both large and small scales. And the Rashomon effect also suggests that reality isnât structured in such a reductive, bottom-up way."],["p","If anything, Feynmanâs example understated the mystery of the Rashomon effect, which is actually twofold. Itâs strange that, as Feynman says, there are multiple valid ways of describing so many physical phenomena. But an even stranger fact is that, when there are competing descriptions, one often turns out to be more true than the others, because it extends to a deeper or more general description of reality. Of the three ways of describing objectsâ motion, for instance, the approach that turns out to be more true is the underdog: the principle of least action. In everyday reality, itâs strange to imagine that objects move by âchoosingâ the easiest path. (How does a falling rock know which trajectory to take before it gets going?) But, a century ago, when physicists began to make experimental observations about the strange behavior of elementary particles, only the least-action interpretation of motion proved conceptually compatible. A whole new mathematical languageâquantum mechanicsâhad to be developed to describe particlesâ probabilistic ability to play out all possibilities and take the easiest path most frequently. Of the various classical laws of motionâall workable, all usefulâonly the principle of least action also extends to the quantum world."],["p","It happens again and again that, when there are many possible descriptions of a physical situationâall making equivalent predictions, yet all wildly different in premiseâone will turn out to be preferable, because it extends to an underlying reality, seeming to account for more of the universe at once. And yet this new description might, in turn, have multiple formulationsâand one of those alternatives may apply even more broadly. Itâs as though physicists are playing a modified telephone game in which, with each whisper, the message is translated into a different language. The languages describe different scales or domains of the same reality but arenât always related etymologically.

Many physicists feel trapped. They have a hunch that they need to transcend the notion that objects move and interact in space and time. Einsteinâs general theory of relativity beautifully weaves space and time together into a four-dimensional fabric, known as space-time, and equates gravity with warps in that fabric. But Einsteinâs theory and the space-time concept break down inside black holes and at the moment of the big bang. Space-time, in other words, may be a translation of some other description of reality that, though more abstract or unfamiliar, can have greater explanatory power."],["p","Some researchers are attempting to wean physics off of space-time in order to pave the way toward this deeper theory. Currently, to predict how particles morph and scatter when they collide in space-time, physicists use a complicated diagrammatic scheme invented by Richard Feynman. The so-called Feynman diagrams indicate the probabilities, or âscattering amplitudes,â of different particle-collision outcomes. In 2013, Nima Arkani-Hamed and Jaroslav Trnka discovered a reformulation of scattering amplitudes that makes reference to neither space nor time. They found that the amplitudes of certain particle collisions are encoded in the volume of a jewel-like geometric object, which they dubbed the amplituhedron. Ever since, they and dozens of other researchers have been exploring this new geometric formulation of particle-scattering amplitudes, hoping that it will lead away from our everyday, space-time-bound conception to some grander explanatory structure."],["p","Whether these researchers are on the right track or not, the web of explanations of reality exists. Perhaps the most striking thing about those explanations is that, even as each draws only a partial picture of reality, they are mathematically perfect. Take general relativity. Physicists know that Einsteinâs theory is incomplete. Yet it is a spectacular artifice, with a spare, taut mathematical structure. Fiddle with the equations even a little and you lose all of its beauty and simplicity. It turns out that, if you want to discover a deeper way of explaining the universe, you canât take the equations of the existing description and subtly deform them. Instead, you must make a jump to a totally different, equally perfect mathematical structure. Whatâs the point, theorists wonder, of the perfection found at every level, if itâs bound to be superseded?"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIt%20seems%20inconceivable%20that%20this%20intricate%20web%20of%20perfect%20mathematical%20descriptions%20is%20random%20or%20happenstance.%20This%20mystery%20must%20have%20an%20explanation.%20But%20what%20might%20such%20an%20explanation%20look%20like%3F%20One%20common%20conception%20of%20physics%20is%20that%20its%20laws%20are%20like%20a%20machine%20that%20humans%20are%20building%20in%20order%20to%20predict%20what%20will%20happen%20in%20the%20future.%20The%20%E2%80%9Ctheory%20of%20everything%E2%80%9D%20is%20like%20the%20ultimate%20prediction%20machine%E2%80%94a%20single%20equation%20from%20which%20everything%20follows.%20But%20this%20outlook%20ignores%20the%20existence%20of%20the%20many%20different%20machines%2C%20built%20in%20all%20manner%20of%20ingenious%20ways%2C%20that%20give%20us%20equivalent%20predictions.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ETo%20Arkani-Hamed%2C%20the%20multifariousness%20of%20the%20laws%20suggests%20a%20different%20conception%20of%20what%20physics%20is%20all%20about.%20We%E2%80%99re%20not%20building%20a%20machine%20that%20calculates%20answers%2C%20he%20says%3B%20instead%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20discovering%20questions.%20Nature%E2%80%99s%20shape-shifting%20laws%20seem%20to%20be%20the%20answer%20to%20an%20unknown%20mathematical%20question.%20This%20is%20why%20Arkani-Hamed%20and%20his%20colleagues%20find%20their%20studies%20of%20the%20amplituhedron%20so%20promising.%20Calculating%20the%20volume%20of%20the%20amplituhedron%20is%20a%20question%20in%20geometry%E2%80%94one%20that%20mathematicians%20might%20have%20pondered%2C%20had%20they%20discovered%20the%20object%20first.%20Somehow%2C%20the%20answer%20to%20the%20question%20of%20the%20amplituhedron%E2%80%99s%20volume%20describes%20the%20behavior%20of%20particles%E2%80%94and%20that%20answer%2C%20in%20turn%2C%20can%20be%20rewritten%20in%20terms%20of%20space%20and%20time.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EArkani-Hamed%20now%20sees%20the%20ultimate%20goal%20of%20physics%20as%20figuring%20out%20the%20mathematical%20question%20from%20which%20all%20the%20answers%20flow.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20ascension%20to%20the%20tenth%20level%20of%20intellectual%20heaven%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9Cwould%20be%20if%20we%20find%20the%20question%20to%20which%20the%20universe%20is%20the%20answer%2C%20and%20the%20nature%20of%20that%20question%20in%20and%20of%20itself%20explains%20why%20it%20was%20possible%20to%20describe%20it%20in%20so%20many%20different%20ways.%E2%80%9D%20It%E2%80%99s%20as%20though%20physics%20has%20been%20turned%20inside%20out.%20It%20now%20appears%20that%20the%20answers%20already%20surround%20us.%20It%E2%80%99s%20the%20question%20we%20don%E2%80%99t%20know.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","It seems inconceivable that this intricate web of perfect mathematical descriptions is random or happenstance.

This is why Arkani-Hamed and his colleagues find their studies of the amplituhedron so promising. Calculating the volume of the amplituhedron is a question in geometryâone that mathematicians might have pondered, had they discovered the object first.

Zealand, a man parked his car in an alleyway outside [Al Noor Mosque](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-to-talk-about-the-new-zealand-massacre-more-sunlight-less-oxygen). Six minutes later, dozens of people were dead or wounded. We know far too much about what happened in between, because the shooter streamed it all to Facebook Live. A post on a far-right Internet forum hosted by the Web site 8chan directed users to the stream; quickly, video of the shooting spread across YouTube and Instagram. A manifesto was shared on Twitter, filled with references to Donald Trump, right-wing American punditry, and white-supremacist memes.\n\nI spoke with Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who, over the past eight years, has become an authority on the content-moderation strategies employed by tech companies. (Her book â[Behind the Screen: Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media](https://www.amazon.com/Behind-Screen-Content-Moderation-Shadows/dp/0300235887)â will be published by Yale University Press, in June.) In recent years, Roberts has watched with incredulity as companies such as Twitter and Facebook encouraged users to begin streaming live video. âThere are not enough moderators in the world to monitor every live stream,â she said. Social-media platforms were already struggling to moderate content posted in the usual way; live-streamed video, which can attract large audiences almost instantly, is even more challenging. \n\nIn theory, Roberts told me, machine-learning systems might one day identify violent and hateful streams as they unfold in real time, although she questions whether we actually want even the most sophisticated algorithms determining what should or shouldnât make its way onto a platform. In practice, there are few effective systems in place. âBy and large, live streaming came online with none of that stuff sorted out,â she said. âThere was no real plan for, âWhat are we going to do when people start using it in the worst possible way?â&nbsp;â As live-streaming tools proliferated, some people in the industry worried that it might be âungovernable.â But the social-media industry was embroiled in what Roberts calls a âfunctionality arms race.â Twitter acquired the live-streaming app Periscope in 2015; Facebook launched Facebook Live the next year. \n\nThere are options for slowing the torrent of live-streamed videos in general. Platforms could make access to the technology a privilege for trusted users, for example. But such measures would also impede the streaming of video thatâs regarded as socially usefulâbroadcasts from political protests, say, or of police violence. For a time, Facebook Live was widely seen as a useful conduit for positive social change. In the end, it may be impossible to separate the good from the bad.\n\nSocial-media platforms were eager to embrace live streaming because it promised growth. Now scale has become a burden. âMainstream platforms are putting resources into moderation, but itâs a bit like closing the barn door after the horses have gotten out,â Roberts said. The problem isnât just new content; once a video is streamed, it spreads, often to sites that have no interest in policing what they host or that lack the resources to moderate. âIt will take a while to undo the years of allowing these materials to proliferate and have a foothold on all of these platforms.â \n\nAnd moderators at any one company must reckon with the fact that, ultimately, social-media platforms form a collective ecosystem, ranging from the mainstream to the fringeâfrom Facebook to 8chan. âPeople donât use social-media sites in isolation,â Roberts said. Part of the challenge of moderation is that users may act differently in different spaces, appearing anodyne in one and toxic in another. The shooter in Christchurch, Roberts told me, seems to have been moving ânot only among the mainstream platforms but also among different kinds of ideological registers online. He probably cut his teeth on the mainstream platforms. Then, at some point, he became engaged in these spaces where radical incitement to violence and hate speech were the bread and butter. And then, in order to haveâIâm sickened to even talk like thisâthe greatest impact with his behavior, he went back to the mainstream to showcase it.â At one point in his stream, the shooter called out, âSubscribe to PewDiePie!ââa nod to a YouTube channel with eighty-nine million followers, run by the [divisive Internet personality](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/technology/pewdiepie-new-zealand-shooting.html) Felix Kjellberg. This seems less like an earnest endorsement and more like an attempt to merge the mainstream of social media with the fringe. (âI feel absolutely sickened having my named uttered by this person,â Kjellberg tweeted, after the attack.) \n\nThe industry-wide, cross-platform scale of the content-moderation problem is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. âI cannot believe that anyone in these companies feels anything but sick about this,â Roberts said. Lately, she has noticed a shift in the way the industry talks about itself. âFor years, it was, âOur tools are neutral,â&nbsp;â she said. âNow they might say, âOur tools are a mirror, and they reflect society as it is.â&nbsp;â Increasingly, those who work in social media are shifting even further. âThe mirror analogy isnât sufficient, because of the vast power of these platforms to normalize, reify, amplify, and disseminate this material,â Roberts said. Collectively, as a system, social platforms donât just mirror societyâthey change it.

It was a poisonously global moment: the attacker broadcast the massacre live on Facebook, and he posted a so-called manifesto to Twitter, regurgitating neo-Nazi in-jokes and immigration-conspiracy theories about âbirth ratesâ and âwhite genocide.â His particulars merit little more attention than that.\n\nBy now, we know to restrain our instinct to recirculate, and perversely glamourize, the details. We know to deprive the virulent corners of modern life of the âoxygen of amplification,â in the words of Whitney Phillips, of the Data & Society Research Institute, who is the author of a [valuable report](https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-PART-3_Oxygen_of_Amplification_DS.pdf ) on the interplay between extremists, technology, and journalism. In a list of best practices, Phillips reminds reporters to treat violent language and memes as âinherently contagiousâ and to avoid highlighting âobjectively falseâ ideas unless they are prominently undermined. \n\nIt is good advice, but it can also be misused. As news spread of the gunmanâs motives, Donald Trump, Jr., who is not known for his powers of restraint, expressed a sudden desire not to give the âNZ shooter what he wants.â He [tweeted](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1106406797051600897), âDonât speak his name donât show the footage. Seems that most agree on that. The questions is can the media do whatâs right and pass up the ratings theyâll get by doing the opposite? I fear we all know the answer unfortunately.â \n\nDon, Jr.,âs newfound sympathy for decorum most likely owes less to a nuanced theory of violence and publicity than to the shameful reality that the New Zealand killer hailed his father,  President Donald Trump, as âa symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.â In the Oval Office, a few hours later, the President was asked if he considers white nationalism a rising threat. âI donât, really,â he said. âI think itâs a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.â Trump called the incident âa terrible thing.â He was speaking, not incidentally, during a ceremony in which he vetoed an attempt to block his use of emergency funds to build a border wall. He complained, as ever, about an âinvasionâ of illegal immigrants.\n\nThe New Zealand killer takes his place in the cracked pantheon of violent, Trump-admiring extremists: beside the gunman at the Tree of Life synagogue, in Pittsburgh, who blamed Jews for resettling refugees and immigrants, whom Trump vilifies as the center of his politics; beside the van-dweller in Miami who found purpose amid the throngs of Trump rallies and set about sending pipe bombs to George Soros, journalists, and Democrats.Â The New Zealand killer did not exact his violence in America, but [he would be at home in our statistics](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-right-wing-terrorism-and-the-enemy-within/): in the past decade, seventy-three per cent of all American extremist-related killings have come from the right wing, compared to twenty-three per cent from Salafi jihadism and three per cent from the left wing, according to the Soufan Center, which studies global security. \n\nPointing out those patterns does not feed oxygen to the sources; it subjects them to the disinfecting power of sunlight. We can only have an honest analysis of the sources of this violence if we understand how it grows and spreads. That applies not only to the role of journalism but also to the role of technology. Whenever a killer relies, as he did in this case, on the Internet to amplify the effects of his terror, some inevitably defend social media as no better and no worse than the humanity that uses it. Donât blame the hammer, we are told; blame the hand. At best, that is a deflection. One does not have to be a Luddite to believe that the worst of social media is not a mirror image of us; it is a grotesque distortion, a funhouse mirror that bulges and squeezes and disfigures us in ways that mock our humanity instead of reinforcing it.\n\nOnce again, Facebook finds itself scrambling to explain how it will prevent its creations from being used for harm. When I interviewed a range of Facebook executives last year, several of them touted the use of artificial intelligence and human moderators to prevent the misuse of Facebook Live. Alex Schultz, a longtime Facebook staffer, told me that, to detect instances of suicide or murder on Facebook Live, the company created a system that looks for sudden spikes in attentionââby number of people viewing, by the rate at which those impressions are going up, by the percentage of sad reactions versus likes, by the number of people saying, âOh, my Godâ down in the comments.â He said, âThen you need artificial intelligence to be able to read those comments, to get the signal out so you can rank it.â In this case, the rampage was broadcast by a head-mounted camera for a hideous seventeen minutes. It stopped only after Facebook was alerted by New Zealand police. In a statement, Mia Garlick, of Facebook New Zealand, said, âOur hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this horrendous act. New Zealand Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the livestream commenced and we quickly removed both the shooterâs Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video.â\n\nBy then, archives of the video were everywhere. Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative reporter at the *Observer*, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/carolecadwalla/status/1106533948530876416), âI may have reached my moment of total despair. The full video is all over YouTube. All over Facebook.â She pointed to a version that had been watched twenty-three thousand times on Facebook in one hour. âAnd 1000s out there,â she wrote.\n\nFor Facebook, the New Zealand massacre is [a gruesome measure](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/eve7w7/documents-show-how-facebook-moderates-terrorism-on-livestreams) of the social-media platformâs power and its limitations. The attack struck just as the company is attempting to refashion itself to focus on small-scale, encrypted conversations. But that new focus will expand alongside the main news feed of public conversation; it will not replace the public forum. And so the peril remains. The company did not create the root causeâwhat the scholar Thomas Rid [calls](https://twitter.com/RidT/status/1106562419483119616) a âviolent transnational neo-fascist ideologyââbut the technology has multiplied its force to a degree that is almost beyond measure.\n\nTo allow the killer to monopolize the final image of this moment would be a mistake. Instead, it is worth pausing to absorb the words and deeds of another person whose image raced around the world on social media in the hours after the New Zealand attack: Jill Keats, who is sixty-six, was driving to the mall when she heard what she thought were firecrackers. Then, people started collapsing. âOne fell just to the left of my car and one fell to the right,â she [told a reporter](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/03/the-poor-guy-passed-away-witness-describes-distressing-chaos-of-christchurch-shooting-scene.html). \n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nKeats, who has a silver ponytail and was wearing a gray cardigan, ducked to avoid gunfire. Then she loaded a wounded man into her car to protect him, and, with the help of another bystander, she compressed his wounds to stanch the bleeding. \n\nâHe was trying to ring his wife, and I managed to get it and I answered the phone and I said to her, âYour husbandâs been shot outside the mosque.â I said, and âDonât come here to Deanâs Ave, you wonât get throughâbut please go to a hospital and wait for him,â&nbsp;â Keats said. âThen I kept talking to him and telling him she was at the hospital waiting and he wasnât to give up. Here we just kept pressure on him and did the best we could for him until we could get him some help.â\n\nHer voice cracking, she went on, âIn the meantime, the poor guy across the road passed away.â She paused. âI never thought in my life I would live to see something like this.

He does not enjoy interviews, especially after two years of ceaseless controversy. Having got his start as a programmer with a nocturnal bent, he is also not a morning person. Walking toward the kitchen, which has a long farmhouse table and cabinets painted forest green, he said, âI havenât eaten breakfast yet. Have you?â\n\nSince 2011, Zuckerberg has lived in a century-old white clapboard Craftsman in the Crescent Park neighborhood, an enclave of giant oaks and historic homes not far from Stanford University. The house, which cost seven million dollars, affords him a sense of sanctuary. Itâs set back from the road, shielded by hedges, a wall, and mature trees. Guests enter through an arched wooden gate and follow a long gravel path to a front lawn with a saltwater pool in the center. The year after Zuckerberg bought the house, he and his longtime girlfriend, Priscilla Chan, held their wedding in the back yard, which encompasses gardens, a pond, and a shaded pavilion. Since then, they have had two children, and acquired a seven-hundred-acre estate in Hawaii, a ski retreat in Montana, and a four-story town house on Liberty Hill, in San Francisco. But the familyâs full-time residence is here, a ten-minute drive from Facebookâs headquarters.\n\nOccasionally, Zuckerberg records a Facebook video from the back yard or the dinner table, as is expected of a man who built his fortune exhorting employees to keep âpushing the world in the direction of making it a more open and transparent place.â But his appetite for personal openness is limited. Although Zuckerberg is the most famous entrepreneur of his generation, he remains elusive to everyone but a small circle of family and friends, and his efforts to protect his privacy inevitably attract attention. The local press has chronicled his feud with a developer who announced plans to build a mansion that would look into Zuckerbergâs master bedroom. After a legal fight, the developer gave up, and Zuckerberg spent forty-four million dollars to buy the houses surrounding his. Over the years, he has come to believe that he will always be the subject of criticism. âWeâre notâpick your noncontroversial businessâselling dog food, although I think that people who do that probably say there is controversy in that, too, but this is an inherently cultural thing,â he told me, of his business. âItâs at the intersection of technology and psychology, and itâs very personal.â\n\nHe carried a plate of banana bread and a carafe of water into the living room, and settled onto a navy-blue velvet sofa. Since co-founding Facebook, in 2004, his uniform has evolved from hoodies and flip-flops to his current outfit, a gray sweater, indigo jeans, and black Nikes. At thirty-four, Zuckerberg, who has very fair skin, a tall forehead, and large eyes, is leaner than when he first became a public figure, more than a decade ago. On the porch, next to the front door, he keeps a Peloton stationary bike, a favorite accessory in the tech world, which live-streams a personal trainer to your home. Zuckerberg uses the machine, but he does not love cycling. A few years ago, on his first attempt to use a road bike with racing pedals, he forgot to unclip, tipped over, and broke his arm. Except for cycling on his porch, he said, âI havenât clipped in since.â\n\nHe and his wife prefer board games to television, and, within reach of the couch, I noticed a game called Ricochet Robots. âIt gets extremely competitive,â Zuckerberg said. âWe play with these friends, and one of them is a genius at this. Playing with him is just infuriating.â Dave Morin, a former Facebook employee who is the founder and C.E.O. of Sunrise Bio, a startup seeking cures for depression, used to play Risk with Zuckerberg at the office. âHeâs not playing you in a game of Risk. Heâs playing you in a game of games,â Morin told me. âThe first game, he might amass all his armies on one property, and the next game he might spread them all over the place. Heâs trying to figure out the psychological way to beat you in all the games.â\n\nAcross the tech industry, the depth of Zuckerbergâs desire to win is often remarked upon. Dick Costolo, the former C.E.O. of [Twitter](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Twitter), told me, âHeâs a ruthless execution machine, and if he has decided to come after you, youâre going to take a beating.â Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, said, âThere are a number of people in the Valley who have a perception of Mark that heâs really aggressive and competitive. I think some people are a little hesitant about him from that perspective.â Hoffman has been an investor in Facebook since its early days, but for a long time he sensed that Zuckerberg kept his distance because they were both building social networks. âFor many years, it was, like, âYour LinkedIn thing is going to be crushed, so even though weâre friendly, I donât want to get too close to you personally, because Iâm going to crush you.â Now, of course, thatâs behind us and weâre good friends.â\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about this reputation, he framed the dynamic differently. The survival of any social-media business rests on ânetwork effects,â in which the value of the network grows only by finding new users. As a result, he said, âthereâs a natural zero-sumness. If weâre going to achieve what we want to, itâs not just about building the best features. Itâs about building the best community.â He added, âI care about succeeding. And, yes, sometimes you have to beat someone to something, in order to get to the next thing. But thatâs not primarily the way that I think I roll.â\n\nFor many years, Zuckerberg ended Facebook meetings with the half-joking exhortation âDomination!â Although he eventually stopped doing this (in European legal systems, âdominanceâ refers to corporate monopoly), his discomfort with losing is undimmed. A few years ago, he played Scrabble on a corporate jet with a friendâs daughter, who was in high school at the time. She won. Before they played a second game, he wrote a simple computer program that would look up his letters in the dictionary so that he could choose from all possible words. Zuckerbergâs program had a narrow lead when the flight landed. The girl told me, âDuring the game in which I was playing the program, everyone around us was taking sides: Team Human and Team Machine.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIf Facebook were a country, it would have the largest population on earth. More than 2.2 billion people, about a third of humanity, log in at least once a month. That user base has no precedent in the history of American enterprise. Fourteen years after it was founded, in Zuckerbergâs dorm room, Facebook has as many adherents as Christianity.\n\nA couple of years ago, the company was still revelling in its power. By collecting vast quantities of information about its users, it allows advertisers to target people with precisionâa business model that earns Facebook more ad revenue in a year than all American newspapers combined. Zuckerberg was spending much of his time conferring with heads of state and unveiling plans of fantastical ambition, such as building giant drones that would beam free Internet (including Facebook) into developing countries. He enjoyed extraordinary control over his company; in addition to his positions as chairman and C.E.O., he controlled about sixty per cent of shareholder votes, thanks to a special class of stock with ten times the power of ordinary shares. His personal fortune had grown to more than sixty billion dollars. Facebook was one of four companies (along with Google, Amazon, and Apple) that dominated the Internet; the combined value of their stock is larger than the G.D.P. of France.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfdbd07a5060baeb7b]||||||\n+++\n\nFor years, Facebook had heard concerns about its use of private data and its ability to shape peopleâs behavior. The companyâs troubles came to a head during the Presidential election of 2016, when propagandists used the site to spread misinformation that helped turn society against itself. Some of the culprits were profiteers who gamed Facebookâs automated systems with toxic political clickbait known as âfake news.â In a prime example, at least a hundred Web sites were traced to Veles, Macedonia, a small city where entrepreneurs, some still in high school, discovered that posting fabrications to pro-[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) Facebook groups unleashed geysers of traffic. Fake-news sources also paid Facebook to âmicrotargetâ ads at users who had proved susceptible in the past.\n\nThe other culprits, according to U.S. intelligence, were Russian agents who wanted to sow political chaos and help Trump win. In February, [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), the special counsel investigating Russiaâs role in the election, charged thirteen Russians with an âinterference operationâ that made use of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The Internet Research Agency, a firm in St. Petersburg working for the Kremlin, drew hundreds of thousands of users to Facebook groups optimized to stoke outrage, including Secured Borders, Blacktivist, and Defend the 2nd. They used Facebook to organize offline rallies, and bought Facebook ads intended to hurt Hillary Clintonâs standing among Democratic voters. (One read âHillary Clinton Doesnât Deserve the Black Vote.â) With fewer than a hundred operatives, the I.R.A. achieved an astonishing impact: Facebook estimates that the content reached as many as a hundred and fifty million users.\n\nAt the same time, former Facebook executives, echoing a growing body of research, began to voice misgivings about the companyâs role in exacerbating isolation, outrage, and addictive behaviors. One of the largest studies, published last year in the _American Journal of Epidemiology_, followed the Facebook use of more than five thousand people over three years and found that higher use correlated with self-reported declines in physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction. At an event in November, 2017, Sean Parker, Facebookâs first president, called himself a âconscientious objectorâ to social media, saying, âGod only knows what itâs doing to our childrenâs brains.â A few days later, Chamath Palihapitiya, the former vice-president of user growth, told an audience at Stanford, âThe short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society worksâno civil discourse, no coÃ¶peration, misinformation, mistruth.â Palihapitiya, a prominent [Silicon Valley](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Silicon-Valley) figure who worked at Facebook from 2007 to 2011, said, âI feel tremendous guilt. I think we all knew in the back of our minds.â Of his children, he added, âTheyâre not allowed to use this shit.â (Facebook replied to the remarks in a statement, noting that Palihapitiya had left six years earlier, and adding, âFacebook was a very different company back then.â)\n\nIn March, Facebook was confronted with an even larger scandal: the _Times_ and the British newspaper the _Observer_ reported that a researcher had gained access to the personal information of Facebook users and sold it to [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Cambridge-Analytica), a consultancy hired by Trump and other Republicans which advertised using âpsychographicâ techniques to manipulate voter behavior. In all, the personal data of eighty-seven million people had been harvested. Moreover, Facebook had known of the problem since December of 2015 but had said nothing to users or regulators. The company acknowledged the breach only after the press discovered it.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica revelations touched off the most serious crisis in Facebookâs history, and, with it, a public reckoning with the power of Big Tech. Facebook is now under investigation by the F.B.I., the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as by authorities abroad, from London to Brussels to Sydney. Facebookâs peers and rivals have expressed conspicuously little sympathy. [Elon Musk](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Elon-Musk) deleted his Facebook pages and those of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. [Tim Cook](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Tim-Cook), the C.E.O. of Apple, told an interviewer, âWe could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer,â but âweâve elected not to do that.â At Facebookâs annual shareholder meeting, in May, executives struggled to keep order. An investor who interrupted the agenda to argue against Zuckerbergâs renomination as chairman was removed. Outside, an airplane flew a banner that read â*YOU BROKE DEMOCRACY.*{: .small}â It was paid for by Freedom from Facebook, a coalition of progressive groups that have asked the F.T.C. to break up the company into smaller units.\n\nOn July 25th, Facebookâs stock price dropped nineteen per cent, cutting its market value by a hundred and nineteen billion dollars, the largest one-day drop in Wall Street history. Nick Bilton, a technology writer at _Vanity Fair_, tweeted that Zuckerberg was losing $2.7 million per second, âdouble what the average American makes in an entire lifetime.â Facebookâs user base had flatlined in the U.S. and Canada, and dropped slightly in Europe, and executives warned that revenue growth would decline further, in part because the scandals had led users to opt out of allowing Facebook to collect some data. Facebook depends on trust, and the events of the past two years had made people wonder whether the company deserved it.\n\nZuckerbergâs friends describe his travails as a by-product of his success. He is often compared to another Harvard dropout, [Bill Gates](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Bill-Gates), who has been his mentor in business and philanthropy. Gates told me, âSomebody who is smart, and rich, and ends up not acknowledging problems as quickly as they should will be attacked as arrogant. That comes with the territory.â He added, âI wouldnât say that Markâs an arrogant individual.â But, to critics, Facebook is guilty of a willful blindness driven by greed, naÃ¯vetÃ©, and contempt for oversight.\n\nIn a series of conversations over the summer, I talked to Zuckerberg about Facebookâs problems, and about his underlying views on technology and society. We spoke at his home, at his office, and by phone. I also interviewed four dozen people inside and outside the company about its culture, his performance, and his decision-making. I found Zuckerberg straining, not always coherently, to grasp problems for which he was plainly unprepared. These are not technical puzzles to be cracked in the middle of the night but some of the subtlest aspects of human affairs, including the meaning of truth, the limits of free speech, and the origins of violence.\n\nZuckerberg is now at the center of a full-fledged debate about the moral character of Silicon Valley and the conscience of its leaders. Leslie Berlin, a historian of technology at Stanford, told me, âFor a long time, Silicon Valley enjoyed an unencumbered embrace in America. And now everyone says, Is this a trick? And the question Mark Zuckerberg is dealing with is: Should my company be the arbiter of truth and decency for two billion people? Nobody in the history of technology has dealt with that.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFacebookâs headquarters, at 1 Hacker Way, in Menlo Park, overlooking the salt marshes south of San Francisco, has the feel of a small, prosperous dictatorship, akin to Kuwait or Brunei. The campus is a self-contained universe, with the full range of free Silicon Valley perks: dry cleaning, haircuts, music lessons, and food by the acre, including barbecue, biryani, and salad bars. (New arrivals are said to put on the âFacebook fifteen.â) Along with stock options and generous benefits, such trappings have roots in the nineteen-seventies, when, Leslie Berlin said, founders aspired to create pleasant workplaces and stave off the rise of labor unions. The campus, which was designed with the help of consultants from Disney, is arranged as an ersatz town that encircles a central plaza, with shops and restaurants and offices along a main street. From the air, the word â*Hack*{: .small}â is visible in gigantic letters on the plaza pavement.\n\nOn Zuckerbergâs campus, he is king. Executives offer fulsome praise. David Marcus, who runs Facebookâs blockchain project, told me recently, âWhen I see him portrayed in certain ways, it really hurts me personally, because itâs not the guy he is.â Even when colleagues speak more candidly, on the whole they like him. âHeâs not an asshole,â a former senior executive told me. âThatâs why people work there so long.â\n\nBefore I visited Zuckerberg for the first time, in June, members of his staff offered the kind of advice usually reserved for approaching a skittish bird: proceed gingerly, build a connection, avoid surprises. The advice, I discovered, wasnât necessary. In person, he is warmer and more direct than his public pronouncements, which resemble a politicianâs bland pablum, would suggest. The contrast between the public and the private Zuckerberg reminded me of Hillary Clinton. In both cases, friends complain that the popular image is divorced from the casual, funny, generous person they know. Yet neither Zuckerberg nor Clinton has found a way to publicly express a more genuine persona. In Zuckerbergâs case, moments of self-reflection are so rare that, last spring, following a CNN interview in which he said that he wanted to build a company that âmy girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for,â the network framed the clip as a news event, with the title âZuckerberg in rare emotional moment.â\n\nI asked Zuckerberg about his aversion to opening up.âIâm not the most polished person, and I will say something wrong, and you see the cost of that,â he said. âI donât want to inflict that pain, or do something thatâs going to not reflect well on the people around me.â In the most recent flap, a few weeks earlier, he had told Kara Swisher, the host of the â[Recode Decode](https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575158/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-full-transcript-kara-swisher)â podcast, that he permits Holocaust deniers on Facebook because he isnât sure if they are âintentionally getting it wrong.â After a furor erupted, he issued a statement saying that he finds Holocaust denial âdeeply offensive.â Zuckerberg told me, âIn an alternate world where there werenât the compounding experiences that I had, I probably would have gotten more comfortable being more personal, and out there, and I wouldnât have felt pushback every time I did something. And maybe my persona, or at least how I felt comfortable acting publicly, would shift.â\n\nThe downside of Zuckerbergâs exalted status within his company is that it is difficult for him to get genuine, unexpurgated feedback. He has tried, at times, to puncture his own bubble. In 2013, as a New Yearâs resolution, he pledged to meet someone new, outside Facebook, every day. In 2017, he travelled to more than thirty states on a âlistening tourâ that he hoped would better acquaint him with the outside world. David Plouffe, President Obamaâs former campaign manager, who is now the head of policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the familyâs philanthropic investment company, attended some events on the tour. He told me, âWhen a politician goes to one of those, itâs an hour, and theyâre talking for fifty of those minutes. He would talk for, like, five, and just ask questions.â\n\nBut the exercise came off as stilted and tone-deaf. Zuckerberg travelled with a professional photographer, who documented him feeding a calf in Wisconsin, ordering barbecue, and working on an assembly line at a Ford plant in Michigan. Online, people joked that the photos made him look like an extraterrestrial exploring the human race for the first time. A former Facebook executive who was involved in the tour told a friend, âNo one wanted to tell Mark, and no one did tell Mark, that this really looks just dumb.â\n\nZuckerberg has spent nearly half his life inside a company of his own making, handpicking his lieutenants, and sculpting his environment to suit him. Even Facebookâs signature royal blue reflects his tastes. He is red-green color-blind, and he chose blue because he sees it most vividly. [Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Sheryl-Sandberg), the chief operating officer, told me, âSometimes Mark will say, in front of the company, âWell, Iâve never worked anywhere else, but Sheryl tells meÂ .&#160;.&#160;.â&#160;â She went on, âHe acknowledges he doesnât always have the most experience. Heâs only had the experience heâs had, and being Mark Zuckerberg is pretty extraordinary.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nLong before it seemed inevitable or even plausible, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg had an outsized sense of his own potential. It was âa teleological frame of feeling almost chosen,â a longtime friend told me. âI think Mark has always seen himself as a man of history, someone who is destined to be great, and I mean that in the broadest sense of the term.â Zuckerberg has observed that more than a few giants of history grew up in bourgeois comfort near big cities and then channelled those advantages into transformative power.\n\nIn Zuckerbergâs case, the setting was Dobbs Ferry, New York, a Westchester County suburb twenty-five miles north of New York City. His mother, Karen Kempner, grew up in Queens; on a blind date, she met a mailmanâs son, Edward Zuckerberg, of Flatbush, who was studying to be a dentist. They married and had four children. Mark, the only boy, was the second-oldest. His mother, who had become a psychiatrist, eventually gave up her career to take care of the kids and manage the dental office, which was connected to the family home. Of his father, Zuckerberg told me, âHe was a dentist, but he was also a huge techie. So he always had not just a system for drilling teeth but, like, the laser system for drilling teeth that was controlled by the computer.â Ed Zuckerberg marketed himself as the Painless Dr. Z, and later drummed up dentistry business with a direct-mail solicitation that declared, âI am literally the Father of Facebook!â (Since 2013, Zuckerbergâs parents have lived in California, where Ed practices part time and lectures on using social media to attract patients.)\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf2c0c1035aeefc65e]||||||\n+++\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Ed bought early personal computersâthe Atari 800, the I.B.M. XTâand Mark learned to code. At twelve, he set up his first network, ZuckNet, on which messages and files could be shared between the house and his fatherâs dental office. Rabbi David Holtz, of Temple Beth Abraham, in Tarrytown, told me that he watched Zuckerberg with other kids and sensed that he was âbeyond a lot of his peers. He was thinking about things that other people were not.â When I asked Zuckerberg where his drive came from, he traced it to his grandparents, who had immigrated from Europe in the early twentieth century. âThey came over, went through the Great Depression, had very hard lives,â he said. âTheir dream for their kids was that they would each become doctors, which they did, and my mom just always believed that we should have a bigger impact.â His eldest sister, Randi, an early Facebook spokesperson, has gone on to write books and host a radio show; Donna received her Ph.D. in classics from Princeton and edits an online classics journal; Arielle has worked at Google and as a venture capitalist.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg was a junior in high school, he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he spent most of his time coding, fencing, and studying Latin. Ancient Rome became a lifelong fascination, first because of the language (âItâs very much like coding or math, and so I appreciated thatâ) and then because of the history. Zuckerberg told me, âYou have all these good and bad and complex figures. I think Augustus is one of the most fascinating. Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace.â For non-classics majors: Augustus Caesar, born in 63 B.C., staked his claim to power at the age of eighteen and turned Rome from a republic into an empire by conquering Egypt, northern Spain, and large parts of central Europe. He also eliminated political opponents, banished his daughter for promiscuity, and was suspected of arranging the execution of his grandson.\n\nâWhat are the trade-offs in that?â Zuckerberg said, growing animated. âOn the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today. Two hundred years feels unattainable.â On the other hand, he said, âthat didnât come for free, and he had to do certain things.â In 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan spent their honeymoon in Rome. He later said, âMy wife was making fun of me, saying she thought there were three people on the honeymoon: me, her, and Augustus. All the photos were different sculptures of Augustus.â The couple named their second daughter August.\n\nIn 2002, Zuckerberg went to [Harvard](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvard), where he embraced the hacker mystique, which celebrates brilliance in pursuit of disruption. âThe âfuck youâ to those in power was very strong,â the longtime friend said. In 2004, as a sophomore, he embarked on the project whose origin story is now well known: the founding of Thefacebook.com with four fellow-students (âtheâ was dropped the following year); the legal battles over ownership, including a suit filed by twin brothers, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, accusing Zuckerberg of stealing their idea; the disclosure of embarrassing messages in which Zuckerberg mocked users for giving him so much data (âthey âtrust me.â dumb fucks,â he wrote); his regrets about those remarks, and his efforts, in the years afterward, to convince the world that he has left that mind-set behind.\n\nDuring Zuckerbergâs sophomore year, in line for the bathroom at a party, he met Priscilla Chan, who was a freshman. Her parents, who traced their roots to China, had grown up in Vietnam and arrived in the U.S. as refugees after the war, settling in Quincy, Massachusetts, where they washed dishes in a Chinese restaurant. Priscilla was the eldest of three daughters, and the first member of her family to go to college. âI suddenly go to Harvard, where thereâs this world where people had real and meaningful intellectual pursuits,â she said. âThen I met Mark, who so exemplified that.â She was struck by how little Zuckerbergâs background had in common with her own. âFifty per cent of people go to college from the high school I went to. You could learn how to be a carpenter or a mechanic,â she said. âI was just, like, âThis person speaks a whole new language and lives in a framework that Iâve never seen before.â&#160;â She added, âMaybe there was some judgment on my part: âYou donât understand me because you went to Phillips Exeter,â&#160;â but, she said, âI had to realize early on that I was not going to change who Mark was.â After Harvard, Chan taught in a primary school and eventually became a pediatrician. In 2017, she stopped seeing patients to be the day-to-day head of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. When I asked Chan about how Zuckerberg had responded at home to the criticism of the past two years, she talked to me about _Sitzfleisch_, the German term for sitting and working for long periods of time. âHeâd actually sit so long that he froze up his muscles and injured his hip,â she said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter his sophomore year, Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto and never left. Even by the standards of Silicon Valley, Facebookâs first office had a youthful feel. Zuckerberg carried two sets of business cards. One said âIâm CEOÂ .&#160;.&#160;. bitch!â Visitors encountered a graffiti mural of a scantily clad woman riding a Rottweiler. In Adam Fisherâs â[Valley of Genius](https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Genius-Uncensored-History-Founders/dp/1455559024/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591936&sr=8-1&keywords=valley+of+genius+the+uncensored+history+of+silicon+valley),â an oral history of Silicon Valley, an early employee named Ezra Callahan muses, â&#160;âHow much was the direction of the internet influenced by the perspective of nineteen-, twenty-, twenty-one-year-old well-off white boys?â Thatâs a real question that sociologists will be studying forever.â\n\nFacebook was fortunate to launch when it did: Silicon Valley was recovering from the dot-com bust and was entering a period of near-messianic ambitions. The Internet was no longer so new that users were scarce, but still new enough that it was largely unregulated; first movers could amass vast followings and consolidate power, and the coming rise of inexpensive smartphones would bring millions of new people online. Most important, Facebook capitalized on a resource that most people hardly knew existed: the willingness of users to subsidize the company by handing over colossal amounts of personal information, for free.\n\nIn Facebook, Zuckerberg had found the instrument to achieve his conception of greatness. His onetime speechwriter Katherine Losse, in her memoir, â[The Boy Kings](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Kings-Journey-Social-Network/dp/1451668260/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591916&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Boy+Kings),â explained that the âengineering ideology of Facebookâ was clear: âScaling and growth are everything, individuals and their experiences are secondary to what is necessary to maximize the system.â Over time, Facebook devoted ever-greater focus to what is known in Silicon Valley as âgrowth hacking,â the constant pursuit of scale. Whenever the company talked about âconnecting people,â that was, in effect, code for user growth.\n\nThen, in 2007, growth plateaued at around fifty million users and wouldnât budge. Other social networks had maxed out at around that level, and Facebook employees wondered if they had hit a hidden limit. Zuckerberg created a special Growth Team, which had broad latitude to find ways of boosting the numbers. Among other fixes, they discovered that, by offering the site in more languages, they could open huge markets. Alex Schultz, a founding member of the Growth Team, said that he and his colleagues were fanatical in their pursuit of expansion. âYou will fight for that inch, you will die for that inch,â he told me. Facebook left no opportunity untapped. In 2011, the company asked the Federal Election Commission for an exemption to rules requiring the source of funding for political ads to be disclosed. In filings, a Facebook lawyer argued that the agency âshould not stand in the way of innovation.â\n\nSandy Parakilas, who joined Facebook in 2011, as an operations manager, paraphrased the message of his orientation session as âWe believe in the religion of growth.â He said, âThe Growth Team was the coolest. Other teams would even try to call subgroups within their teams the âGrowth Xâ or the âGrowth Yâ to try to get people excited.â\n\nTo gain greater reach, Facebook had made the fateful decision to become a âplatformâ for outside developers, much as Windows had been in the realm of desktop computers, a generation before. The company had opened its trove of data to programmers who wanted to build Facebook games, personality tests, and other apps. After a few months at Facebook, Parakilas was put in charge of a team responsible for making sure that outsiders were not misusing the data, and he was unnerved by what he found. Some games were siphoning off usersâ messages and photographs. In one case, he said, a developer was harvesting user information, including that of children, to create unauthorized profiles on its own Web site. Facebook had given away data before it had a system to check for abuse. Parakilas suggested that there be an audit to uncover the scale of the problem. But, according to Parakilas, an executive rejected the idea, telling him, âDo you really want to see what youâll find?â\n\nParakilas told me, âIt was very difficult to get the kind of resources that you needed to do a good job of insuring real compliance. Meanwhile, you looked at the Growth Team and they had engineers coming out of their ears. All the smartest minds are focussed on doing whatever they can possibly do to get those growth numbers up.â\n\nNew hires learned that a crucial measure of the companyâs performance was how many people had logged in to Facebook on six of the previous seven days, a measurement known as L6/7\\. âYou could say itâs how many people love this service so much they use it six out of seven days,â Parakilas, who left the company in 2012, said. âBut, if your job is to get that number up, at some point you run out of good, purely positive ways. You start thinking about âWell, what are the dark patterns that I can use to get people to log back in?â&#160;â\n\nFacebook engineers became a new breed of behaviorists, tweaking levers of vanity and passion and susceptibility. The real-world effects were striking. In 2012, when Chan was in medical school, she and Zuckerberg discussed a critical shortage of organs for transplant, inspiring Zuckerberg to add a small, powerful nudge on Facebook: if people indicated that they were organ donors, it triggered a notification to friends, and, in turn, a cascade of social pressure. Researchers later found that, on the first day the feature appeared, it increased official organ-donor enrollment more than twentyfold nationwide.\n\nSean Parker later described the companyâs expertise as âexploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.â The goal: âHow do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?â Facebook engineers discovered that people find it nearly impossible not to log in after receiving an e-mail saying that someone has uploaded a picture of them. Facebook also discovered its power to affect peopleâs political behavior. Researchers found that, during the 2010 midterm elections, Facebook was able to prod users to vote simply by feeding them pictures of friends who had already voted, and by giving them the option to click on an âI Votedâ button. The technique boosted turnout by three hundred and forty thousand peopleâmore than four times the number of votes separating Trump and Clinton in key states in the 2016 race. It became a running joke among employees that Facebook could tilt an election just by choosing where to deploy its âI Votedâ button.\n\nThese powers of social engineering could be put to dubious purposes. In 2012, Facebook data scientists used nearly seven hundred thousand people as guinea pigs, feeding them happy or sad posts to test whether emotion is contagious on social media. (They concluded that it is.) When the findings were published, in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, they caused an uproar among users, many of whom were horrified that their emotions may have been surreptitiously manipulated. In an apology, one of the scientists wrote, âIn hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.â\n\nFacebook was, in the words of Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, becoming a pioneer in âpersuasive technology.â He explained, âA hammer, in your hand, is non-persuasiveâit doesnât have its own ways of manipulating the person that holds it. But Facebook and Snapchat, in their design features, are persuading a teen-ager to wake up and see photo after photo after photo of their friends having fun without them, even if it makes them feel worse.â In 2015, Harris delivered a talk at Facebook about his concern that social media was contributing to alienation. âI said, âYou guys are in the best position in the world to deal with loneliness and see it as a thing that you are amplifying and a thing that you can help make go the other way,â&#160;â he told me. âThey didnât do anything about it.â He added, âMy points were in their blind spot.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook grew, Zuckerberg and his executives adopted a core belief: even if people criticized your decisions, they would eventually come around. In one of the first demonstrations of that idea, in 2006, Facebook introduced the News Feed, a feature that suddenly alerted friends whenever a user changed profile pictures, joined groups, or altered a relationship status. (Until then, users had to visit a friendâs page to see updates.) Users revolted. There was a street protest at the headquarters, and hundreds of thousands of people joined a Facebook group opposing the change. Zuckerberg posted a tepid apology (âCalm down. Breathe. We hear you.â), and people got used to the feed.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab502]||||||\n+++\n\nâA lot of the early experience for me was just having people really not believe that what we were going to do was going to work,â Zuckerberg told me. âIf you think about the early narratives, it was, like, âWell, this was just a college thing.â Or âItâs not gonna be a big deal.â Or âO.K., other people are using it, but itâs kind of a fad. Thereâs Friendster and thereâs MySpace, and there will be something after,â or whatever.â He added, âI feel like it really tests you emotionally to have constant doubt, and the assertion that you donât know what you are doing.â\n\nIn 2006, Zuckerberg made his most unpopular decision at the fledgling company. Yahoo was offering a billion dollars to buy Facebook and, as Matt Cohler, a top aide at the time, recalls, âOur growth had stalled out.â Cohler and many others implored Zuckerberg to take the offer, but he refused. âI think nearly all of his leadership team lost faith in him and in the business,â Cohler said. Zuckerberg told me that most of his leadership âleft within eighteen months. Some of them I had to fire because it was just too dysfunctional. It just completely blew up. But the thing that I learned from that is, if you stick with your values and with what you believe you want to be doing in the world, you can get through. Sometimes it will take some time, and you have to rebuild, but thatâs a pretty powerful lesson.â\n\nOn several occasions, Zuckerberg stumbled when it came to issues of privacy. In 2007, Facebook started giving advertisers a chance to buy into a program called Beacon, which would announce to a userâs friends what that user was browsing for, or buying, online. Users could opt out, but many had no idea that the feature existed until it revealed upcoming holiday gifts, or, in some cases, exposed extramarital affairs. Zuckerberg apologized (âWe simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it,â he wrote), and Beacon was withdrawn.\n\nDespite the apology, Zuckerberg was convinced that he was ahead of his users, not at odds with them. In 2010, he said that privacy was no longer a âsocial norm.â That year, the company found itself in trouble again after it revised its privacy controls to make most information public by default. The Federal Trade Commission cited Facebook for âengaging in unfair and deceptive practicesâ with regard to the privacy of user data. The company signed a consent decree pledging to establish a âcomprehensive privacy programâ and to evaluate it every other year for twenty years. In a post, Zuckerberg offered a qualified apology: âI think that a small number of high profile mistakesÂ .&#160;.&#160;. have often overshadowed much of the good work weâve done.â\n\nFacebook had adopted a buccaneering motto, âMove fast and break things,â which celebrated the idea that it was better to be flawed and first than careful and perfect. Andrew Bosworth, a former Harvard teaching assistant who is now one of Zuckerbergâs longest-serving lieutenants and a member of his inner circle, explained, âA failure can be a form of success. Itâs not the form you want, but it can be a useful thing to how you learn.â In Zuckerbergâs view, skeptics were often just fogies and scolds. âThereâs always someone who wants to slow you down,â he said in a commencement address at Harvard last year. âIn our society, we often donât do big things because weâre so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing. The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that canât keep us from starting.â\n\nZuckerbergâs disregard for criticism entered a more emphatic phase in 2010, with the release of the movie â[The Social Network](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/influencing-people),â an account of Facebookâs early years, written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher. Some of the film was fictionalized. It presented Zuckerbergâs motivation largely as a desire to meet girls, even though, in real life, he was dating Priscilla Chan for most of the time period covered in the movie. But other elements cut close to the truth, including the depiction of his juvenile bravado and the early feuds over ownership. Zuckerberg and Facebook had chosen not to be involved in the production, and the portrayal was unflattering. Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is cocksure and cold, and the real Zuckerberg found the depiction hurtful. âFirst impressions matter a lot, and for a lot of people that was their introduction to me,â he told me. âMy reaction to this, to all these things, is primarily that I perceive it through the employees.â His concern was less about how people would think of him, he said, than about âhow is our company, how are our employeesâthese people I work with and care so much aboutâhow are they going to process this?â\n\nBefore the movie came out, Facebook executives debated how to respond. Zuckerberg settled on a stance of effortful good cheer, renting a movie theatre to screen it for the staff. Eight years later, Facebook executives still mention what they call, resentfully, âthe movie.â Sandberg, who is the companyâs second most important public figure, and one of Zuckerbergâs most ardent defenders, told me, âFrom its facts to its essence to its portrayal, I think that was a very unfair picture. I still think it forms the basis of a lot of what people believe about Mark.â\n\nWhile the movie contributed to the fortress mentality on campus, Zuckerberg made a series of decisions that solidified his confidence in his instincts. In 2012, he paid a billion dollars for [Instagram](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/instagram), the photo-sharing service, which at the time had only thirteen employees. Outside the industry, the startup appeared wildly overpriced, but it proved to be one of the best investments in the history of the Internet. (Today, Instagram is valued at more than a hundred times what Zuckerberg paid for it, and, even more important, it is popular with young people, a cohort that shows declining interest in Facebook.) That spring, Facebook went public on the Nasdaq, at a valuation of a hundred and four billion dollars. There were technical glitches on the day of the listing, and many people doubted that the company could earn enough money to justify the valuation. The share price promptly sank. The _Wall Street Journal_ called the I.P.O. a â[fiasco](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577436873952633672),â and shareholders sued Facebook and Zuckerberg. âWe got a ton of criticism,â he recalled. âOur market cap got cut in half. But what I felt was, we were at a sufficient skill and complexity that it was going to take a couple years to work through the problem, but I had strong conviction that we were doing the right thing.â (Even with its recent plunge, the value of Facebook stock has more than quadrupled in the years since.)\n\nZuckerberg was happy to make sharp turns to achieve his aims. In 2011, when users started moving from desktop computers to phones, Facebook swerved toward mobile technology. Zuckerberg told employees that he would kick them out of his office if their ideas did not account for the transition. âWithin a month, you literally canât meet with Mark if youâre not bringing him a mobile product,â Bosworth recalled.\n\nIn 2014, as problems accumulated, Facebook changed its motto, âMove fast and break things,â to the decidedly less glamorous âMove fast with stable infrastructure.â Still, internally, much of the original spirit endured, and the push for haste began to take a toll in the offline world. In early 2016, Zuckerberg directed employees to accelerate the release of Facebook Live, a video-streaming service, and expanded its team of engineers from twelve to more than a hundred. When the product emerged, two months later, so did unforeseen issues: the service let users flag videos as inappropriate, but it didnât give them a way to indicate where in a broadcast the problem appeared. As a result, Facebook Live videos of people committing suicide, or engaged in criminal activity, started circulating before reviewers had time to race through, find the issues, and take the videos down. A few months after the service launched, a Chicago man named Antonio Perkins was fatally shot on Facebook Live and the video was viewed hundreds of thousands of times.\n\nThe incident might have served as a warning to slow down, but, instead, the next day, Bosworth sent around a remarkable internal memo justifying some of Facebookâs âuglyâ physical and social effects as the trade-offs necessary for growth: âMaybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is \\*de facto\\* good.â\n\nThis spring, after the memo [leaked to BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data), Bosworth said that he had been playing devilâs advocate, and Zuckerberg issued a statement: âBoz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. Weâve never believed the ends justify the means.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nZuckerberg was also experimenting with [philanthropy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/gospels-of-giving-for-the-new-gilded-age). In 2010, shortly before the release of âThe Social Network,â he made a high-profile gift. Appearing onstage at âThe Oprah Winfrey Show,â along with Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, and Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, he announced a hundred-million-dollar donation to help Newarkâs struggling public-school system. [The project](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled) quickly encountered opposition from local groups that saw it as out of touch, and, eight years later, itâs generally considered a failure. In May, Ras Baraka, Newarkâs mayor, said of the donation, âYou canât just cobble up a bunch of money and drop it in the middle of the street and say, âThis is going to fix everything.â&#160;â\n\nFor all the criticism, the project has produced some measurable improvements. A Harvard study found greater gains in English than the state average, and a study by MarGrady Research, an education-policy group, found that high-school graduation rates and over-all student enrollment in Newark have risen since the donation. Zuckerberg emphasizes those results, even as he acknowledges flaws in his approach. âYour earning potential is dramatically higher if you graduate from high school versus not. That part of it, I think, is the part that worked and it was effective,â he said. âThere were a bunch of other things that we tried that either were much harder than we thought or just didnât work.â Strategies that helped him in business turned out to hurt him in education reform. âI think in a lot of philanthropy and government-related work, if you try five things and a few of them fail, then the ones that fail are going to get a lot of the attention,â he said.\n\nIn 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan pledged to spend ninety-nine per cent of their Facebook fortune âto advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation.â They created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited-liability company that gives to charity, invests in for-profit companies, and engages in political advocacy. David Plouffe said that the lessons of the Newark investment shaped the initiativeâs perspective. âI think the lesson was, you have to do this in full partnership with the community, not just the leaders,â he said. âYou need to have enthusiastic buy-in from superintendents, and teachers, and parents.â\n\nIn contrast to a traditional foundation, an L.L.C. can lobby and give money to politicians, without as strict a legal requirement to disclose activities. In other words, rather than trying to win over politicians and citizens in places like Newark, Zuckerberg and Chan could help elect politicians who agree with them, and rally the public directly by running ads and supporting advocacy groups. (A spokesperson for C.Z.I. said that it has given no money to candidates; it has supported ballot initiatives through a 501(c)(4) social-welfare organization.) âThe whole point of the L.L.C. structure is to allow a coÃ¶rdinated attack,â Rob Reich, a co-director of Stanfordâs Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, told me. The structure has gained popularity in Silicon Valley but has been criticized for allowing wealthy individuals to orchestrate large-scale social agendas behind closed doors. Reich said, âThere should be much greater transparency, so that itâs not dark. Thatâs not a criticism of Mark Zuckerberg. Itâs a criticism of the law.â\n\nIn 2016, Zuckerberg announced, onstage and in a Facebook post, his intention to âhelp cure all disease in our childrenâs lifetime.â That was partly bluster: C.Z.I. is working on a slightly more realistic agenda, to âcure, prevent or manage all diseases.â The theatrics irritated some in the philanthropy world who thought that Zuckerbergâs presentation minimized the challenges, but, in general, scientists have applauded the ambition. When I asked Zuckerberg about the reception of the project, he said, âItâs funny, when I talk to people here in the Valley, you get a couple of reactions. A bunch of people have the reaction of âOh, thatâs obviously going to happen on its ownâwhy donât you just spend your time doing something else?â And then a bunch of people have the reaction of âOh, that seems almost impossibleâwhy are you setting your sights so high?â&#160;â\n\nCharacteristically, Zuckerberg favors the optimistic scenario. âOn average, every year for the last eighty years or so, I think, life expectancy has gone up by about a quarter of a year. And, if you believe that technological and scientific progress is not going to slow, there is a potential upside to speeding that up,â he said. âWeâre going to get to a point where the life expectancy implied by extrapolating that out will mean that weâll basically have been able to manage or cure all of the major things that people suffer from and die from today. Based on the data that we already see, it seems like thereâs a reasonable shot.â\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3ce01fe0d4c650956c9]||||||\n+++\n\nI asked Bill Gates, whose private foundation is the largest in the U.S., about Zuckerbergâs objectives. âThere are aspirations and then there are plans,â he said. âAnd plans vary in terms of their degree of realism and concreteness.â He added that Zuckerbergâs long-range goal is âvery safe, because you will not be around to write the article saying that he overcommitted.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook expanded, so did its blind spots. The companyâs financial future relies partly on growth in developing countries, but the platform has been a powerful catalyst of violence in fragile parts of the globe. In India, the largest market for Facebookâs WhatsApp service, hoaxes have triggered riots, lynchings, and fatal beatings. Local officials resorted to shutting down the Internet sixty-five times last year. In Libya, people took to Facebook to trade weapons, and armed groups relayed the locations of targets for artillery strikes. In Sri Lanka, after a Buddhist mob attacked Muslims this spring over a false rumor, a Presidential adviser told the _[Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html)_, âThe germs are ours, but Facebook is the wind.â\n\nNowhere has the damage been starker than in [Myanmar](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Myanmar), where the Rohingya Muslim minority has been subject to brutal killings, gang rapes, and torture. In 2012, around one per cent of the countryâs population had access to the Internet. Three years later, that figure had reached twenty-five per cent. Phones often came preloaded with the Facebook app, and Buddhist extremists seeking to inflame ethnic tensions with the Rohingya mastered the art of misinformation. Wirathu, a monk with a large Facebook following, sparked a deadly riot against Muslims in 2014 when he shared a fake report of a rape and warned of a âJihad against us.â Others gamed Facebookâs rules against hate speech by fanning paranoia about demographic change. Although Muslims make up no more than five per cent of the country, a popular graphic appearing on Facebook cautioned that âwhen Muslims become the most powerfulâ they will offer âIslam or the sword.â\n\nBeginning in 2013, a series of experts on Myanmar met with Facebook officials to warn them that it was fuelling attacks on the Rohingya. David Madden, an entrepreneur based in Myanmar, delivered a presentation to officials at the Menlo Park headquarters, pointing out that the company was playing a role akin to that of the radio broadcasts that spread hatred during the Rwandan genocide. In 2016, C4ADS, a Washington-based nonprofit, published a detailed analysis of Facebook usage in Myanmar, and described a âcampaign of hate speech that actively dehumanizes Muslims.â Facebook officials said that they were hiring more Burmese-language reviewers to take down dangerous content, but the company repeatedly declined to say how many had actually been hired. By last March, the situation had become dire: almost a million Rohingya had fled the country, and more than a hundred thousand were confined to internal camps. The United Nations investigator in charge of examining the crisis, which the U.N. has deemed a genocide, said, âIâm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it was originally intended.â Afterward, when pressed, Zuckerberg repeated the claim that Facebook was âhiring dozensâ of additional Burmese-language content reviewers.\n\nMore than three months later, I asked Jes Kaliebe Petersen, the C.E.O. of Phandeeyar, a tech hub in Myanmar, if there had been any progress. âWe havenât seen any tangible change from Facebook,â he told me. âWe donât know how much content is being reported. We donât know how many people at Facebook speak Burmese. The situation is getting worse and worse here.â\n\nI saw Zuckerberg the following morning, and asked him what was taking so long. He replied, âI think, fundamentally, weâve been slow at the same thing in a number of areas, because itâs actually the same problem. But, yeah, I think the situation in Myanmar is terrible.â It was a frustrating and evasive reply. I asked him to specify the problem. He said, âAcross the board, the solution to this is we need to move from what is fundamentally a reactive model to a model where we are using technical systems to flag things to a much larger number of people who speak all the native languages around the world and who can just capture much more of the content.â\n\nI told him that people in Myanmar are incredulous that a company with Facebookâs resources has failed to heed their complaints. âWeâre taking this seriously,â he said. âYou canât just snap your fingers and solve these problems. It takes time to hire the people and train them, and to build the systems that can flag stuff for them.â He promised that Facebook would have âa hundred or more Burmese-speaking people by the end of the year,â and added, âI hate that weâre in this position where we are not moving as quickly as we would like.â A few weeks after our conversation, Facebook announced that it was banning Myanmarâs Army chief and several other military officials.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg had come to see his ability to reject complaints as a virtue. But, by 2016, that stance had primed the company for a crisis. Tristan Harris, the design ethicist, said, âWhen youâre running anything like Facebook, you get criticized all the time, and you just stop paying attention to criticism if a lot of it is not well founded. You learn to treat it as naÃ¯ve and uninformed.â He went on, âThe problem is it also puts you out of touch with genuine criticism from people who actually understand the issues.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe 2016 election was supposed to be good for Facebook. That January, Sheryl Sandberg told investors that the election would be âa big deal in terms of ad spend,â comparable to the Super Bowl and the World Cup. According to Borrell Associates, a research and consulting firm, candidates and other political groups were on track to spend $1.4 billion online in the election, up ninefold from four years earlier.\n\nFacebook offered to âembedâ employees, for free, in Presidential campaign offices to help them use the platform effectively. Clintonâs campaign said no. Trumpâs said yes, and Facebook employees helped his campaign craft messages. Although Trumpâs language was openly hostile to ethnic minorities, inside Facebook his behavior felt, to some executives, like just part of the distant cesspool of Washington. Americans always seemed to be choosing between a hated Republican and a hated Democrat, and Trumpâs descriptions of Mexicans as rapists was simply an extension of that.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump used Facebook to raise two hundred and eighty million dollars. Just days before the election, his team paid for a voter-suppression effort on the platform. According to _Bloomberg Businessweek_, it targeted three Democratic constituenciesââidealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americansââsending them videos precisely tailored to discourage them from turning out for Clinton. Theresa Hong, the Trump campaignâs digital-content director, later told an interviewer, âWithout Facebook we wouldnât have won.â\n\nAfter the election, Facebook executives fretted that the company would be blamed for the spread of fake news. Zuckerbergâs staff gave him statistics showing that the vast majority of election information on the platform was legitimate. At a tech conference a few days later, Zuckerberg was defensive. âThe idea that fake news on Facebookâof which, you know, itâs a very small amount of the contentâinfluenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,â he said. To some at Facebook, Zuckerbergâs defensiveness was alarming. A former executive told [_Wired_,](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/) âWe had to really flip him on that. We realized that if we didnât, the company was going to start heading down this pariah path.â\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about his âpretty crazyâ comment, he said that he was wrong to have been âglib.â He told me, âNobody wants any amount of fake news. It is an issue on an ongoing basis, and we need to take that seriously.â But he still bristles at the implication that Facebook may have distorted voter behavior. âI find the notion that people would only vote some way because they were tricked to be almost viscerally offensive,â he said. âBecause it goes against the whole notion that you should trust people and that individuals are smart and can understand their own experience and can make their own assessments about what direction they want their community to go in.â\n\nShortly after the election, Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, contacted Facebook to discuss Russian interference. âThe initial reaction was completely dismissive,â he told me. But, by the spring, he sensed that the company was realizing that it had a serious problem. âThey were seeing an enormous amount of Russian activity in the French elections,â Warner said. âIt was getting better, but I still donât think they were putting nearly enough resources behind this.â Warner, who made a fortune in the telecom business, added, âMost of the companies in the Valley think that policymakers, one, donât get it, and, two, that ultimately, if they just stonewall us, then weâll go away.â\n\nFacebook moved fitfully to acknowledge the role it had played in the election. In September of 2017, after Robert Mueller obtained a search warrant, Facebook agreed to give his office an inventory of ads linked to Russia and the details of who had paid for them. In October, Facebook disclosed that Russian operatives had published about eighty thousand posts, reaching a hundred and twenty-six million Americans.\n\nIn March, after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, Zuckerberg and Facebook were paralyzed. For five days, Zuckerberg said nothing. His personal Facebook profile offered no statements or analysis. Its most recent post was a photo of him and Chan baking hamantaschen for Purim.\n\nâI feel like weâve let people down and that feels terrible,â he told me later. âBut it goes back to this notion that we shouldnât be making the same mistake multiple times.â He insists that fake news is less common than people imagine: âThe average person might perceive, from how much we and others talk about it, that there is more than ten times as much misinformation or hoax content on Facebook than the academic measures that weâve seen so far suggest.â He is still not convinced that the spread of misinformation had an impact on the election. âI actually donât consider that a closed thing,â he said. âI still think thatâs the kind of thing that needs to be studied.â\n\nIn conversation, Zuckerberg is, unsurprisingly, highly analytical. When he encounters a theory that doesnât accord with his own, he finds a seam of disagreementâa fact, a methodology, a premiseâand hammers at it. Itâs an effective technique for winning arguments, but one that makes it difficult to introduce new information. Over time, some former colleagues say, his deputies have begun to filter out bad news from presentations before it reaches him. A former Facebook official told me, âThey only want to hear good news. They donât want people who are disagreeing with them. There is a culture of âYou go along to get along.â&#160;â\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfbc66792cd5fab4be]||||||\n+++\n\nI once asked Zuckerberg what he reads to get the news. âI probably mostly read aggregators,â he said. âI definitely follow Techmemeââa roundup of headlines about his industryââand the media and political equivalents of that, just for awareness.â He went on, âThereâs really no newspaper that I pick up and read front to back. Well, that might be true of most people these daysâmost people donât read the physical paperâbut there arenât many news Web sites where I go to browse.â\n\nA couple of days later, he called me and asked to revisit the subject. âI felt like my answers were kind of vague, because I didnât necessarily feel like it was appropriate for me to get into which specific organizations or reporters I read and follow,â he said. âI guess what I tried to convey, although Iâm not sure if this came across clearly, is that the job of uncovering new facts and doing it in a trusted way is just an absolutely critical function for society.â\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg have attributed their mistakes to excessive optimism, a blindness to the darker applications of their service. But that explanation ignores their fixation on growth, and their unwillingness to heed warnings. Zuckerberg resisted calls to reorganize the company around a new understanding of privacy, or to reconsider the depth of data it collects for advertisers.\n\nJamesÂ P. Steyer, the founder and C.E.O. of Common Sense Media, an organization that promotes safety in technology and media for children, visited Facebookâs headquarters in the spring of 2018 to discuss his concerns about a product called Messenger Kids, which allows children under thirteenâthe minimum age to use the primary Facebook appâto make video calls and send messages to contacts that a parent approves. He met with Sandberg and Elliot Schrage, at the time the head of policy and communications. âI respect their business success, and like Sheryl personally, and I was hoping they might finally consider taking steps to better protect kids. Instead, they said that the best thing for young kids was to spend more time on Messenger Kids,â Steyer told me. âThey still seemed to be in denial. Would _you_ âmove fast and break thingsâ when it comes to children? To our democracy? No, because you can damage them forever.â\n\nTo some people in the company, the executives seemed concentrated not on solving the problems or on preventing the next ones but on containing the damage. Tavis McGinn, a former Google pollster, started working at Facebook in the spring of 2017, doing polls with a narrow focus: measuring the public perception of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. During the next six months, McGinn conducted eight surveys and four focus groups in three countries, collecting the kinds of measurements favored by politicians and advertisers. Facebook polled reactions to the companyâs new stated mission to âbring the world closer together,â as well as to items on Zuckerbergâs social-media feed, including his writings, photographs, and even his casual banter during a back-yard barbecue broadcast on Facebook Live.\n\nIn September, McGinn resigned. In an interview, he told the Web site the Verge that he had become discouraged. âI was not going to be able to change the way that the company does business,â he said. âI couldnât change the values. I couldnât change the culture.â He concluded that measuring the âtrue social outcomesâ of Facebook was of limited interest to senior staffers. âI think research can be very powerful, if people are willing to listen,â he said. âBut I decided after six months that it was a waste of my time to be there. I didnât feel great about the product. I didnât feel proud to tell people I worked at Facebook. I didnât feel I was helping the world.â (McGinn, who has signed a nondisclosure agreement with Facebook, declined to comment for this article.)\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn March, Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress for the first time about Facebookâs handling of user data. The hearing was scheduled for April. As the date approached, the hearing acquired the overtones of a trial.\n\nIn barely two years, the mood in Washington had shifted. Internet companies and entrepreneurs, formerly valorized as the vanguard of American ingenuity and the astronauts of our time, were being compared to Standard Oil and other monopolists of the Gilded Age. This spring, the _Wall Street Journal_ published [an article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-titans-tiptoe-toward-monopoly-1527783845) that began, âImagine a not-too-distant future in which trustbusters force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.â It was accompanied by a sepia-toned illustration in which portraits of Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and other tech C.E.O.s had been grafted onto overstuffed torsos meant to evoke the robber barons. In 1915, Louis Brandeis, the reformer and future Supreme Court Justice, testified before a congressional committee about the dangers of corporations large enough that they could achieve a level of near-sovereignty âso powerful that the ordinary social and industrial forces existing are insufficient to cope with it.â He called this the âcurse of bigness.â Tim Wu, a Columbia law-school professor and the author of a forthcoming book inspired by Brandeisâs phrase, told me, âToday, no sector exemplifies more clearly the threat of bigness to democracy than Big Tech.â He added, âWhen a concentrated private power has such control over what we see and hear, it has a power that rivals or exceeds that of elected government.â\n\nShortly before Zuckerberg was due to testify, a team from the Washington law firm of WilmerHale flew to Menlo Park to run him through mock hearings and to coach him on the requisite gestures of humility. Even before the recent scandals, Bill Gates had advised Zuckerberg to be alert to the opinions of lawmakers, a lesson that Gates had learned in 1998, when Microsoft faced accusations of monopolistic behavior. Gates testified to Congress, defiantly, that âthe computer-software industry is not broken, and there is no need to fix it.â Within months, the Department of Justice sued Microsoft for violating federal antitrust law, leading to three years of legal agony before a settlement was reached. Gates told me that he regretted âtauntingâ regulators, saying, âNot something I would choose to repeat.â He encouraged Zuckerberg to be attentive to D.C. âI said, âGet an office thereânow.â And Mark did, and he owes me,â Gates said. Last year, Facebook spent $11.5 million on lobbying in Washington, ranking it between the American Bankers Association and General Dynamics among top spenders.\n\nOn April 10th, when Zuckerberg arrived at the [Senate hearing](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/what-was-missing-from-mark-zuckerbergs-first-day-of-congressional-testimony), he wore a sombre blue suit, and took a seat before more than forty senators. In front of him, his notes outlined likely questions and answers, including the prospect that a senator might ask him to step down from the company. His answer, in shorthand, would be: âFounded Facebook. My decisions. I made mistakes. Big challenge, but weâve solved problems before, going to solve this one. Already taking action.â\n\nAs it turned out, nobody asked him to resignâor much of anything difficult. Despite scattered moments of pressure, the overwhelming impression left by the event was how poorly some senators grasped the issues. In the most revealing moment, Orrin Hatch, the eighty-four-year-old Republican from Utah, demanded to know how Facebook makes money if âusers donât pay for your service.â Zuckerberg replied, âSenator, we run ads,â allowing a small smile.\n\nTo observers inclined to distrust Zuckerberg, he was evasive to the point of amnesiacâhe said, more than forty times, that he would need to follow upâbut when the hearing concluded, after five hours, he had emerged unscathed, and Wall Street, watching closely, rewarded him by boosting the value of Facebookâs stock by twenty billion dollars. A few days later, on the internal Facebook message board, an employee wrote that he planned to buy T-shirts reading âSenator, we run ads.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg whether policymakers might try to break up Facebook, he replied, adamantly, that such a move would be a mistake. The field is âextremely competitive,â he told me. âI think sometimes people get into this mode of âWell, thereâs not, like, an exact replacement for Facebook.â Well, actually, that makes it _more_ competitive, because what we really are is a system of different things: we compete with Twitter as a broadcast medium; we compete with Snapchat as a broadcast medium; we do messaging, and iMessage is default-installed on every iPhone.â He acknowledged the deeper concern. âThereâs this other question, which is just, laws aside, how do we feel about these tech companies being big?â he said. But he argued that efforts to âcurtailâ the growth of Facebook or other Silicon Valley heavyweights would cede the field to China. âI think that anything that weâre doing to constrain them will, first, have an impact on how successful we can be in other places,â he said. âI wouldnât worry in the near term about Chinese companies or anyone else winning in the U.S., for the most part. But there are all these places where there are day-to-day more competitive situationsâin Southeast Asia, across Europe, Latin America, lots of different places.â\n\nThe rough consensus in Washington is that regulators are unlikely to try to break up Facebook. The F.T.C. will almost certainly fine the company for violations, and may consider blocking it from buying big potential competitors, but, as a former F.T.C. commissioner told me, âin the United States youâre allowed to have a monopoly position, as long as you achieve it and maintain it without doing illegal things.â\n\nFacebook is encountering tougher treatment in Europe, where antitrust laws are stronger and the history of fascism makes people especially wary of intrusions on privacy. One of the most formidable critics of Silicon Valley is the [European Union](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/european-union)âs top antitrust regulator, Margrethe Vestager. Last year, after an investigation of Googleâs search engine, Vestager accused the company of giving an âillegal advantageâ to its shopping service and fined it $2.7 billion, at that time the largest fine ever imposed by the E.U. in an antitrust case. In July, she added another five-billion-dollar fine for the companyâs practice of requiring device makers to preinstall Google apps.\n\nIn Brussels, Vestager is a high-profile presenceânearly six feet tall, with short black-and-silver hair. She grew up in rural Denmark, the eldest child of two Lutheran pastors, and, when I spoke to her recently, she talked about her enforcement powers in philosophical terms. âWhat weâre dealing with, when people start doing something illegal, is exactly as old as Adam and Eve,â she said. âHuman decisions very often are guided by greed, by fear of being pushed out of the marketplace, or of losing something thatâs important to you. And then, if you throw power into that cocktail of greed and fear, you have something that you can recognize throughout time.â\n\nVestager told me that her office has no open cases involving Facebook, but she expressed concern that the company was taking advantage of users, beginning with terms of service that she calls âunbalanced.â She paraphrased those terms as âItâs your data, but you give us a royalty-free global license to do, basically, whatever we want.â Imagine, she said, if a brick-and-mortar business asked to copy all your photographs for its unlimited, unspecified uses. âYour children, from the very first day until the confirmation, the rehearsal dinner for the wedding, the wedding itself, the first child being baptized. You would never accept that,â she said. âBut this is what you accept without a blink of an eye when itâs digital.â\n\nIn Vestagerâs view, a healthy market should produce competitors to Facebook that position themselves as ethical alternatives, collecting less data and seeking a smaller share of user attention. âWe need social media that will allow us to have a nonaddictive, advertising-free space,â she said. âYouâre more than welcome to be successful and to dramatically outgrow your competitors if customers like your product. But, if you grow to be dominant, you have a special responsibility not to misuse your dominant position to make it very difficult for others to compete against you and to attract potential customers. Of course, we keep an eye on it. If we get worried, we will start looking.â\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab503]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs the pressure on Facebook has intensified, the company has been moving to fix its vulnerabilities. In December, after Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya spoke publicly about the damaging psychological effects of social media, Facebook acknowledged evidence that heavy use can exacerbate anxiety and loneliness. After years of perfecting addictive features, such as âauto-playâ videos, it announced a new direction: it would promote the quality, rather than the quantity, of time spent on the site. The company modified its algorithm to emphasize updates from friends and family, the kind of content most likely to promote âactive engagement.â In a post, Zuckerberg wrote, âWe can help make sure that Facebook is time well spent.â\n\nThe company also grappled with the possibility that it would once again become a vehicle for election-season propaganda. In 2018, hundreds of millions of people would be voting in elections around the world, including in the U.S. midterms. After years of lobbying against requirements to disclose the sources of funding for political ads, the company announced that users would now be able to look up who paid for a political ad, whom the ad targeted, and which other ads the funders had run.\n\nSamidh Chakrabarti, the product manager in charge of Facebookâs âelection integrityâ work, told me that the revelations about Russiaâs Internet Research Agency were deeply alarming. âThis wasnât the kind of product that any of us thought that we were working on,â he said. With the midterms approaching, the company had discovered that Russiaâs model for exploiting Facebook had inspired a generation of new actors similarly focussed on skewing political debate. âThere are lots of copycats,â Chakrabarti said.\n\nZuckerberg used to rave about the virtues of âfrictionless sharing,â but these days Facebook is working on âimposing frictionâ to slow the spread of disinformation. In January, the company hired Nathaniel Gleicher, the former director for cybersecurity policy on President Obamaâs National Security Council, to blunt âinformation operations.â In July, it removed thirty-two accounts running disinformation campaigns that were traced to Russia. A few weeks later, it removed more than six hundred and fifty accounts, groups, and pages with links to Russia or Iran. Depending on your point of view, the removals were a sign either of progress or of the growing scale of the problem. Regardless, they highlighted the astonishing degree to which the security of elections around the world now rests in the hands of Gleicher, Chakrabarti, and other employees at Facebook.\n\nAs hard as it is to curb election propaganda, Zuckerbergâs most intractable problem may lie elsewhereâin the struggle over which opinions can appear on Facebook, which cannot, and who gets to decide. As an engineer, Zuckerberg never wanted to wade into the realm of content. Initially, Facebook tried blocking certain kinds of material, such as posts featuring nudity, but it was forced to create long lists of exceptions, including images of breast-feeding, âacts of protest,â and works of art. Once Facebook became a venue for political debate, the problem exploded. In April, in a call with investment analysts, Zuckerberg said glumly that it was proving âeasier to build an A.I. system to detect a nipple than what is hate speech.â\n\nThe cult of growth leads to the curse of bigness: every day, a billion things were being posted to Facebook. At any given moment, a Facebook âcontent moderatorâ was deciding whether a post in, say, Sri Lanka met the standard of hate speech or whether a dispute over Korean politics had crossed the line into bullying. Zuckerberg sought to avoid banning users, preferring to be a âplatform for all ideas.â But he needed to prevent Facebook from becoming a swamp of hoaxes and abuse. His solution was to ban âhate speechâ and impose lesser punishments for âmisinformation,â a broad category that ranged from crude deceptions to simple mistakes. Facebook tried to develop rules about how the punishments would be applied, but each idiosyncratic scenario prompted more rules, and over time they became byzantine. According to Facebook training slides published by the _Guardian_ last year, moderators were told that it was permissible to say âYou are such a Jewâ but not permissible to say âIrish are the best, but really French sucks,â because the latter was defining another people as âinferiors.â Users could not write âMigrants are scum,â because it is dehumanizing, but they could write âKeep the horny migrant teen-agers away from our daughters.â The distinctions were explained to trainees in arcane formulas such as âNot ProtectedÂ +Â Quasi protectedÂ =Â not protected.â\n\nIn July, the issue landed, inescapably, in Zuckerbergâs lap. For years, Facebook had provided a platform to the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose delusions include that the parents of children killed in the [Sandy Hook school massacre](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/newtown-shooting) are paid actors with an anti-gun agenda. Facebook was loath to ban Jones. When people complained that his rants violated rules against harassment and fake news, Facebook experimented with punishments. At first, it âreducedâ him, tweaking the algorithm so that his messages would be shown to fewer people, while feeding his fans articles that fact-checked his assertions.\n\nThen, in late July, Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, the parents of Noah Pozner, a child killed at Sandy Hook, published an open letter addressed âDear Mr Zuckerberg,â in which they described âliving in hidingâ because of death threats from conspiracy theorists, after âan almost inconceivable battle with Facebook to provide us with the most basic of protections.â In their view, Zuckerberg had âdeemed that the attacks on us are immaterial, that providing assistance in removing threats is too cumbersome, and that our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate.â\n\nFacebook relented, somewhat. On July 27th, it took down four of Jonesâs videos and suspended him for a month. But public pressure did not let up. On August 5th, the dam broke after Apple, saying that the company âdoes not tolerate hate speech,â stopped distributing five podcasts associated with Jones. Facebook shut down four of Jonesâs pages for ârepeatedlyâ violating rules against hate speech and bullying. I asked Zuckerberg why Facebook had wavered in its handling of the situation. He was prickly about the suggestion: âI donât believe that it is the right thing to ban a person for saying something that is factually incorrect.â\n\nJones seemed a lot more than factually incorrect, I said.\n\nâO.K., but I think the facts here are pretty clear,â he said, homing in. âThe _initial_ questions were around misinformation.â He added, âWe donât take it down and ban people unless itâs directly inciting violence.â He told me that, after Jones was reduced, more complaints about him flooded in, alerting Facebook to older posts, and that the company was debating what to do when Apple announced its ban. Zuckerberg said, âWhen they moved, it was, like, O.K., we shouldnât just be sitting on this content and these enforcement decisions. We should move on what we know violates the policy. We need to make a decision now.â\n\nIt will hardly be the last quandary of this sort. Facebookâs free-speech dilemmas have no simple answersâyou donât have to be a fan of Alex Jones to be unnerved by the companyâs extraordinary power to silence a voice when it chooses, or, for that matter, to amplify others, to pull the levers of what we see, hear, and experience. Zuckerberg is hoping to erect a scalable system, an orderly decision tree that accounts for every eventuality and exception, but the boundaries of speech are a bedevilling problem that defies mechanistic fixes. The Supreme Court, defining obscenity, landed on âI know it when I see it.â For now, Facebook is making do with a Rube Goldberg machine of policies and improvisations, and opportunists are relishing it. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, seized on the ban of Jones as a fascist assault on conservatives. In a moment that was rich even by Cruzâs standards, he quoted Martin NiemÃ¶llerâs famous lines about the Holocaust, saying, âAs the poem goes, you know, âFirst they came for Alex Jones.â&#160;â\n\nLast week, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sandberg said, âWe now have over twenty thousand people and we are able to review reports in fifty languages, twenty-four hours a day.â (In the hallway before the session, as if to underscore the complexities ahead, Alex Jones had made a scene, heckling Senator Marco Rubio for not doing more to get him back on Facebook.) In recent years, Sandberg has gained fame for her work outside the company, including her books, âLean In,â a best-seller on womenâs empowerment, and âOption B,â which she wrote after the sudden death of her husband, Dave Goldberg. But her responsibility for the Facebook fallout is likely to grow, and her reputation as C.O.O. hinges on the implementation of changes. Many people in Silicon Valley believe that Sandberg and Facebookâs board of directors must do more to prevent the company from making another major mistake. âI know a couple of guys who are color-blind,â a prominent executive told me, âand their wives lay their clothes out for them in the morning if they donât want to go out every day looking like Bozo the Clown. Sheryl and the board are expected to lay the clothes out for Mark.â He went on, âIf you have blind spots, then you rely on the people around you to tell you where they are.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn one of our conversations, I asked Zuckerberg whether he finds it insulting when people speculate that he lacks emotions. âInsulting?â he asked, and then paused for several seconds to consider. âI donât find it insulting. I donât think itâs _accurate_. I mean, I definitely care a lot. Thereâs a difference between letting emotions drive impulsive decisions and caring.â He went on, âUltimately, I think the reason that we built this successful thing is because we just solve problem after problem after problem, and typically you donât do that by making impulsive, emotional decisions.â\n\nThe caricature of Zuckerberg is that of an automaton with little regard for the human dimensions of his work. The truth is something else: he decided long ago that no historical change is painless. Like Augustus, he is at peace with his trade-offs. Between speech and truth, he chose speech. Between speed and perfection, he chose speed. Between scale and safety, he chose scale. His life thus far has convinced him that he can solve âproblem after problem after problem,â no matter the howling from the public it may cause.\n\nAt a certain point, the habits of mind that served Zuckerberg well on his ascent will start to work against him. To avoid further crises, he will have to embrace the fact that heâs now a protector of the peace, not a disrupter of it. Facebookâs colossal power of persuasion has delivered fortune but also peril. Like it or not, Zuckerberg is a gatekeeper. The era when Facebook could learn by doing, and fix the mistakes later, is over. The costs are too high, and idealism is not a defense against negligence.\n\nIn some sense, the âMark Zuckerberg productionââas he called Facebook in its early yearsâhas only just begun. Zuckerberg is not yet thirty-five, and the ambition with which he built his empire could well be directed toward shoring up his company, his country, and his name. The question is not whether Zuckerberg has the power to fix Facebook but whether he has the will; whether he will kick people out of his officeâwith the gusto that he once mustered for the pivot to mobileâif they donât bring him ideas for preventing violence in Myanmar, or protecting privacy, or mitigating the toxicity of social media. He succeeded, long ago, in making Facebook great. The challenge before him now is to make it good.Â â¦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02cf1c7a8e33fb390be6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Evan Osnos joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2008 and covers politics and foreign affairs.

In it, players join a peacekeeping force thatâs sent to Washington, D.C., after a terrorist attack incites anarchy and closes the government.\n\nFour hours after the initial e-mail, Ubisoft sent a second message apologizing for the first. âWe recognize the very real impact of the United States government shut down on thousands of people and did not intend to make light of the situation,â it read. This was the companyâs latest attempt to claim that the game has no political stance, despite its premise, and that any likeness to current events is purely cosmetic. âWeâre definitely not making any political statements,â Terry Spier, the gameâs creative director, [told a reporter](https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/12/17451688/the-division-2-is-not-making-any-political-statements) last summer.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft, The Division 2 is about political dissension in much the same way that the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, at Disneyland, is about robbery on the high seas. When one plays the game, which is out on Friday, this claim can seem to break down. The Division 2 opens with a sprint across the South Lawn past insurgent fighters and toward a White House that features charred walls and pocked pillars. You are free to wander inside the Presidential residence, which has been turned into a military base. Then you head out into the surrounding shantytowns, where you find debris, dogs, and homemade banners that read âWhere is the aid?â and âFuck the government.â An assortment of virtual weaponry offers the only conduit through which peace may be restored.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nGames have long reflected the political realities in which they are made. Usually, the reflections are straightforward: in the 1980 arcade game Missile Command, which arrived in the midst of the Cold War, you must save six American cities from nuclear attack by shooting down missiles before they strike. Sometimes, though, a game serves as bald propaganda. Suffragetto was an early-twentieth-century board game that framed the emancipation of women as a street fight between police constables and suffragettes on the steps of Londonâs Albert Hall. In the 1936 anti-Semitic board game Juden Raus!, or Jews Out!, players take turns moving pointed-hat-wearing tokens toward collection points. The first player to deport six of these tokens is declared the winner.\n\nIn recent years, video-game developers have continued to borrow politically charged settings while arguing that, unlike Suffragetto or Juden Raus!, their games remain, as Ubisoftâs C.E.O. put it, [politically impartial](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/25/ubisoft-tom-clancy-division-2-politics-criticism). Partly, this is a result of backlash from players. âPublishers are aware that there is a militant fringe of gamers that donât want to see any politics, or, at least, progressive politics, in their hobby,â Paolo Pedercini, an Italian game designer who teaches experimental-game design at the School of Art at Carnegie Mellon University, said. âThey may not represent a majority, but they are vocal and eager to start another battle in the ongoing culture war.â\n\nThe most prominent of these wars was [Gamergate](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/gamergate-scandal-erupts-video-game-community), which erupted in 2014. The Gamergate hashtag, popularized by the actor Adam Baldwin, was used more than a million times on Twitter, often to coÃ¶rdinate e-mail and phone campaigns aimed at companies whose games the movementâs proponents disagreed with or at individualsâwomen or minorities, in particularâwho were considered to have a progressive political agenda. In the years since, even seemingly benign game features have met lingering resistance. In 2018, when the developers of the Second World War-set game Battlefield V announced that the game would include female soldiers, critics claimed that the decision was a symptom of political correctness; they created the hashtag #NotMyBattlefield and set up online petitions demanding a reversal. The message was clear: if a video-game publisher made a political commentary, or seemed to be making one, it risked damaging its bottom line. \n\nSome publishers have refused to budge. (â[Either accept it or donât buy the game](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/319787/This_is_not_okay_EA_minces_no_words_on_backlash_against_women_in_Battlefield.php),â Electronic Artsâ chief creative officer, Patrick SÃ¶derlund, said in response to the Battlefield controversy.) But others have adopted a cautious, almost self-censoring approach. Walt Williams, the writer of Spec Ops: The Line, a blockbuster that provided an unusually forthright exploration of post-traumatic stress disorder in the military, was asked by the gameâs publisher, 2K Games, to avoid all references to the Middle East. While working on Neverwinter Nights 2, the writer Chris Avellone was asked by the gameâs license-holder, Wizards of the Coast, not to make a character bisexual. (âWizardsâ approach has changed in subsequent years,â Avellone told me.) The 2016 game Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was set in an apartheid society in which âAugsââpeople with mechanical enhancements, such as bionic limbs or brain interfacesâwere pit against those who remained ânatural.â The game also included slogans such as âAugs Lives Matters.â But AndrÃ© Vu, a spokesman for the gameâs publisher, Square-Enix, described the similarity to Black Lives Matter as merely an âunfortunate coincidence.â\n\nThis sort of strategyâan eagerness to borrow the aesthetics and frisson of a political theme without addressing that theme explicitlyâfaces its own criticism, both from players and from those who work in the industry. Far Cry 5, a recent game from Ubisoft, was set in rural Montana, and saw you play as a local cop facing civil disobedience from a fanatical militia group. The substance of the game was similar to previous entries in the Far Cry series, which were set in places such as Africa, the Himalayas, and Micronesia, but in relocating to Trump-era Americaâa more proximate locale for much of the gameâs audienceâthe game appeared to reflect current affairs. This, in turn, created an expectation that the gameâs developers would supply a commentary that they did not, in fact, provide. For critics, exploiting only the superficial aspects of the setting was both opportunistic and a waste of a valuable platform.\n\nThese tensions are not unique to video games. In 2016, one of the writers of âRogue One: A Star Wars Storyâ tweeted that [the Galactic Empire represented](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-writers-get-political-will-anti-trump-tweets-hurt-rogue-one-949023) âa white supremacist (human) organization.â After alt-right protesters called for a boycott of the film, Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney, pushed back, saying that âRogue Oneâ was not, âin any way, a political film.â Still, something inherent to video games makes it easier for their creators to claim political neutrality. âGames are designed so that they elevate the expression of players above that of the developer,â Williams said. âYou have to find the right balance between artistic intention and player agency. Publishers donât want to admit that a game might have a political stance or message, because to do so creates player-character dissonance before the game has even been released. They think, How can this character be me, if their actions support a political stance that I do not?â\n\nThe notion of player agency, arguably the mediumâs only unique ingredient, gives video-game directors license to be politically ambiguous. Ken Levine, the director of the Bioshock series, which examines failed utopias, has claimed that his games function as [political Rorschach tests](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/13/bioshock-infinite-interview-ken-levine-racism-history/). âBioshock Infinite was interpreted by some as a criticism of the Tea Party and by others of Occupy Wall Street,â Pedercini said. âItâs a way to infuse a dumb shooting game with a sense of importance, a way to give the idea of dealing with serious and complex issues while withdrawing from any controversial position or judgment.â\n\nIn this way, the video game could be seen as akin to the novel, a form that, more than it suggests or imposes a world view, invites the consumer to consider a theme or inhabit an issue. But, for some, this view ignores the reality of the genre. Tom Bissell, a writer for several blockbuster video games and a [contributor](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/tom-bissell) to this magazine, believes that itâs impossible for video-game publishers to distance themselves from politics, especially if a game revolves around guns. âAll shooting games are inherently political, because they all put forth a vision of violent force being an acceptable catalyst for change,â he said. âYou can contextualize, rationalize, or ignore that subtext as much as you want, but itâs there, inescapably, in every shooter.â For Bissell, if a gameâs mechanics show that life is cheap and force is effective, then this is the message that players will receive, regardless of the words that writers place in the charactersâ mouths.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe inability of blockbuster video games to present a coherent political message is, to some degree, a result of the way in which they are constructed. Robert Yang, a professor at New York Universityâs Game Center, is a one-man designer of political games. (A recent example, Hurt Me Plenty, is a provocative gay-spanking simulator, designed to explore sexuality and consent.) When a game is the product of an individual or small teamâs vision, Yang said, itâs easy to promote a coherent message. On larger games, however, a studio must often divide different character arcs among a team of writers. âThis industrial approach treats writing as an asset they plug into the game, instead of a holistic-design ethos to the entire project,â Yang said. âThe more ambitious political open-world games require a lot of coÃ¶rdination and strong authorial voice and risks.â\n\nTaking those risks requires supporting structures that, in Pederciniâs view, the industry lacks. âThe parallel with the film industry is useful,â he said. âA politically uncompromising film like â[Sorry to Bother You](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/sorry-to-bother-you-reviewed-a-wild-workplace-comedy-energized-by-righteous-anger)â became a blockbuster, but its production would not have been possible without Sundance and a whole supportive ecosystem.â Video games have no such ecosystem; as Yang put it, the medium is in the process of reverse-engineering an art form from an entertainment business. âWe have to build the arts-and-culture platforms and the festival circuits,â Yang said. âWe have to convince funding bodies and governments that games are worth more than their sales numbers.â\n\nIn the meantime, there is the steady drip of change. âThe industry is slowly starting to embrace more diverse storytelling and characterization,â Rhianna Pratchett, a former lead writer on the Tomb Raider series, said. She was referring to [a recent trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A) for the blockbuster game The Last of Us 2, which features a scripted lesbian kiss between two teen-age girls. (Tellingly, the first gay kiss in video games, in The Sims, [was an accident](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-kiss-that-changed-video-games).) âBut itâs baby steps,â Pratchett continued. âWe are still learning how to talk about these things. We are still working out how to be brave.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c992bc86f2c9a2449d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c992bc86f2c9a2449d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Video

He described the thrill as being âas close to sexual satisfaction as you could possibly get.â The feeling was shared, seemingly, by many youths in the Britain of the early nineteen-eighties, when there was little economic opportunity for the working class. Before the industrialization of video gamesâthe great American software factories and their nameless workersâthese teens staged a quiet revolution from their bedrooms, designing games on home microprocessors. Those who managed to place their games into high-street retailers, such as WHSmith, became rich. Like pop stars, they were often only slightly older than their fans, and their work was followed with cultish obsession.\n\nThis historical moment provides the setting for âBandersnatch,â a new episode of the writer [Charlie Brooker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror)âs â[Black Mirror](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/button-pusher).â The episode, which dÃ©buted on Netflix last week, follows Stefan Butler (Fionn Whitehead), a nervy young programmer who, after finding a choose-your-own-adventure-style fantasy novel that belonged to his late mother, begins adapting it into a video game. Butler works from his aromatic bedroom, in a house he still shares with his father. As a means of escape, he considers selling the game, and takes an unfinished version to a publishing house run by the grinningly opportunistic Mohan Thakur (Asim Chaudhry). There he meets one of his heroes, the game designer Colin Ritman (Will Poulter), who personifies the high-flying, bespectacled teen auteur Butler dreams of becoming. Thakur bids to publish Butlerâs game, which is called Bandersnatchâa reference to a real game of the era that famously never came outâand offers Butler help to finish the game and a luxurious advertising campaign to promote it.  \n\nBut the decision to take up Thakurâs offer rests not with Butler but with you, the viewer. Unlike most episodes of â[Black Mirror](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/with-black-mirror-our-dystopia-gets-the-television-show-it-deserves),â âBandersnatchâ is not a tale about the devastating potential of technology. Itâs a work of interactive fictionâa nonlinear story in which we steer the plot via simple A/B choices that occur at key moments in the drama. In the Choose Your Own Adventure novels, which popularized the form in the nineteen-eighties, decisions were made by turning to a specified page number, where the readers could pick up their chosen narrative thread. In âBandersnatch,â these decisionsâwhich range from choosing which cereal Butler should eat to choosing if he should jump off a balconyâare made via the TV remote. (If you fail to pick an option, one is chosen for you, to keep the drama chugging.) Each path winds to one of a clutch of possible endings, some of which are abrupt and unsatisfying, others of which unravel the storyâs mysteries. Some endings even invite the viewer to return to a previous scene, implying that he or she took a wrong turn in the road.\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5c2e2ed68c8f962cd419cd65]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nInteractive fiction, or I.F., is an old and treasured mode of video-game design. Per the veteran designer Sid Meier, a video game is a series of interesting choices; in many ways, the multi-branched story is the purest expression of that idea. âBandersnatchâ is a Netflix episode, so itâs by necessity simpler than many I.F. games, but it also demonstrates both the enduring allure of the format and its exasperating limitations.\n\nThe upside of the form is that steering a story onscreen, with live actors playing out your choices, has a wild magic. But whatâs gained in autonomy is often lost in dramatic impact. I.F. can be a wasteful vehicle for storytelling. Every plot branch multiplies the writerâs work while dividing the proportion of that work that will be seen by players. With every new crossroad, each path becomes more obscure. And every choice made is accompanied by a melancholic chaser, the feeling that weâre missing out on a different, perhaps more satisfying story.  \n\nThe best examples of I.F. cut and chop their story segments in ways that minimize wastefulness. Sam Barlowâs âHer Story,â a thriller released in 2015, presents you with a database of three hundred film clips, which are culled from police tapes filmed during a murder investigation. You canât access the clips in chronological sequence. Instead, you use search terms to query the database, and clips that contain your term (e.g., âaffair,â or âmurderâ) are retrieved for viewing. The story is pieced together in the mind as a jigsaw and only fully known when you uncover every clip through informed guesswork. (Barlowâs work in bringing I.F. to the small screen was the subject of [a piece in *The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/alternate-endings) in 2017.)\n\nBrooker, who began his career as a journalist covering video games, was more tightly bound than Barlow, both by the limits of Netflixâs technology and by the need to appeal to a broad and broadly inexpert audience. His response was to acknowledge, in the episode, the foibles of the I.F. form. During a late-night recreational drug-taking session, Colin Ritman, the rock-star programmer, explains to Butler that he believes in the multiverse. Death, he explains, isnât the end; we inevitably go on living in another time line. This theme gives Brooker license to send viewers back to key crossroads, forcing them to rewatch a portion of the episode before making a different choice.\n\nItâs an ingenious solution, one that turns the game into something like a treasure hunt; the viewer is invited to seek out each pathway and build a four-dimensional picture of the plotâs narrative possibilities. This design minimizes wastefulness, but it also allays our fear of missing out. We can explore various courses of action before settling on our preferred route. There are few such chances in life, where we live with our choices and their repercussions. In its way, âBandersnatchâ offers an antidote to regret.\n\nAnd yet omniscience, it seems, isnât all itâs cracked up to be. One of the thrills of fiction is seeing the ways in which characters respond to miserable circumstances and their own suboptimal choices. Similarly, one of the thrills of a video game is the chance to work our way out of a disaster of our own making. Itâs the pleasure of emptying the Tetris bucket of blocks after a series of missteps, and itâs the satisfaction of watching that final space invader explode, like an iridescent dandelion, seconds before it smacks into your home base.\n\nâBandersnatchâ&nbsp;âs do-overs lighten the weight of our decisions, which in turn lightens the gravity of the whole. Itâs an exhilarating experiment, not least because itâs played out on such a major stage, and on one of Netflixâs prestige properties. Much of the episodeâs success, however, relies on the clever marriage of theme and mechanism. Without this, the flimsiness of the supporting framework, more gimmick than revolution, would be exposed. It is a choice, in short, to be repeated only with great care.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ee52bc86f2c9a244be9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Black Mirror","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"black-mirror"},{"id":"5c2e1c7722d4972cd5b83287","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Netflix","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"netflix"},{"id":"5c2e1c992bc86f2c9a2449d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Video Games","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"video-games"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04a38b51cf59fc424715","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Simon Parkin is a contributing writer to *The New Yorker*.

(The wooers include [Steve Bannon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon), when he was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, and the former Breitbart editor [Milo Yiannopoulos](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/02/how-social-media-trolls-turned-uc-berkeley-into-a-free-speech-circus), who churned out posts with titles such as âFeminist Bullies Tearing the Video Game Industry Apart.â) This scheme has proved effective. Last month, a YouTube user uploaded a clip from the recent blockbuster video game Red Dead Redemption 2, a cowboy playpen set in the late-nineteenth-century American Southwest. In it, the player guides his character toward a computer-controlled suffragette who is campaigning for her right to vote, and punches her unconscious. The video, titled âBeating Up Annoying Feminist,â has  been viewed more than 1\\.7 million times, with a chorus of support in the comments below.\n\nThis kind of trolling can easily escalate. Earlier this month, [NPR broadcast a story](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/05/660642531/right-wing-hate-groups-are-recruiting-video-gamers) in which a father recounted his dismay at finding a neo-Nazi pamphlet that his fifteen-year-old son had printed out after being encouraged by fellow-gamers. âI was crying,â the man said. âI felt like a failure that a child that I had raised would be remotely interested in that sort of stuff.â\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5c06ddcc04d74a2d12344fa1]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe cultural problems around video games, of course, inhere not just in their young players but in their creators. There remains a woeful lack of diversity among those who design video games, and, in the industry at large, among those who decide what kinds of games are made in the first place. But the tectonic plates still shift, slowly, and, at the edges, work of intelligence and interest is produced. While 2018 was hardly a vintage year for video games, there were releases that nevertheless excited, stimulated, and challenged their audiences to think for themselves. Here are nine.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Return of the Obra Dinn (PC, Mac)__\n\nThe Obra Dinn, an East Indiaman merchant ship, was thought to be lost at sea until, one day in 1808, a vessel bearing its name drifts into port. As an insurance-loss adjuster, you must figure out what happened to the crew members, whose bodies litter the shipâs nooks and decks. Much like [Papers, Please](https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/14/4329676/papers-please-a-game-about-an-immigration-inspector), the designer Lucas Popeâs previous game, in which you played as an agent at an Eastern European border checkpoint, the story is told through the lens of a mundane vocation. This time, however, there is a touch of the mystical: a magic pocket watch, found in a casket dredged from the sea, enables you to trigger a flashback whenever you happen upon a corpse. You can then trace the personâs final moments in a frozen diorama, and unearth both his identity and cause of death. The gameâs scratchy, black-and-white art style, a tribute to the Mac Plus, uses blank space and dots to create the illusion of shading. Itâs the ideal aesthetic for a story in which you work to shake a picture from the noise.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Tetris Effect (PlayStation 4)__\n\nDespite more than thirty years of effort, Tetrisâs sequels have, in the main, failed to supersede the original. Designed in 1984 by the Russian engineer Alexei Pajitnov, Tetris, as most people know, requires one to stack a cascade of tetromino shapes as they descend into a bucket. Form an unbroken line across the width of the bucket and the line disappears, creating more room. Itâs an idea that arrived so perfectly formed that no designer has managed to improve it. Until, that is, Tetris Effect, which was designed by the Japanese musician Tetsuya Mizuguchi. Mizuguchi adds to the game a layer of musical notes and effects, which harmonize with both the dance soundtrack and the movement of the pieces. The result is a game in which every moment fizzes with wonder. Like Disneyâs âFantasia,â which yoked animation to music, itâs a simple idea that, through exquisite execution, elevates Tetris to something novel and thrilling.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Red Dead Redemption 2 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)__\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5bff1dbc975e74178e5aa12e]||||||\n\n+++\n\nIn film, television, and, to a lesser extent, literature, storytelling is the business of imposing order on the chaos of life. Usually, this involves editing out the extraneous bits. By contrast, Red Dead Redemption 2, the latest game by the Grand Theft Auto creator Rockstar, seeks to embellish its essential storyâwhich follows a group of outlaws in the twilight of the Old Westâwith endless, intricate diversions. From bear hunting to dominoes, debt collecting to heavy drinking, the extracurricular expanse is at once exhilarating and faintly exhausting. But it also establishes a keen sense of time and place, one thatâs more tactile than anything in film or on TV. In fact, most of the wonder is found when one wanders off-script: if you prefer not to rob a train, you can perch on top of one of its carriages as the world lazily puffs by. Itâs a notable leap forward for the open-world video game, but its success may have come at the cost of those who created it. (Its launch was dogged by stories of Rockstarâs exploitative working practices.)\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Into the Breach (PC, Nintendo Switch)__\n\nA claustrophobic riff on chess, Into the Breach asks you to nudge and shunt three robots around an eight-by-eight grid, taking turns to do battle with giant earthworms called Vek. The sci-fi theme is, broadly, irrelevant. This is a knotty little strategy game, as elegant and carefully calibrated as any of the board-game greats. With no time limit to hustle you toward action, there is time to consider each move and its knock-on consequences, which ripple not only across a given battle but through the entire campaign as you seek to build up your arsenal for the final showdown. What makes Into the Breach unique is that you can see what move each Vek will make next, and in what order. This allows you to foil their plans, shunt them into positions where their attacks will miss, or mitigate inevitable losses. For a game with such a modest canvasâeach battle lasts just five turnsâ these dynamic, shape-shifting puzzles have time-gobbling depths.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Florence (iOS)__\n\nFlorence, a wordless, illustrated story about the bloom and wilt of a twentysomething womanâs courtship, has only a light seasoning of interaction, and no capacity for its player to change the course of the story. In this way, both player and protagonist shareâfrom the first shoots of attraction to the monotonous routine of a long-term relationshipâa sense of inevitability. We share, too, the unthinking to-dos of domesticity: tidying the cluttered shoes, bagging the groceries, brushing teeth. These idle, near throwaway interactions, when taken in concert, build a truthful portrait. Beneath the surface, however, this is a story of the moment. Florence shows a woman stifling her creative urges to support those of the man she loves. The understated narrative, presented in a way that borders on twee, but never trite, contains themes of surprising weight and consequence.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__My Child Lebensborn (iOS)__\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n\n[#image: /photos/5bff1dbca080342cdf810f2d]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe Nazi program of Lebensborn was a kind of inverse Holocaust: it involved the systematic nurture of life according to race. Unmarried Aryan women, some as young as sixteen, were made to carry the babies of S.S. officers. An estimated twelve thousand of these children were born in occupied Norway; after the war, many of them, who had been taken from their mothers at birth, were given up for adoption. In My Child Lebensborn, you assume the role of one of these adoptive parents, nurturing the social, emotional, and educational well-being of your child in a community where both of you have been cruelly ostracized. The game works like a Tamagotchi. You must keep your child clean, fed, and watered at regular intervals. The greater challenge resides in meeting the childrenâs emotional needs, as you help them deal with persistent bullying and advise them on whether to make contact with their biological parents. The game brings what is to many a historical footnote into sharp relief, and over time presents an affecting picture of the fragility of every childâs spirit, and the ease with which it can be ruined by adult will.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__God of War (PlayStation 4)__\n\nThe aesthetic is that of Homeric myth, with all its gore and shrieking sinew, but the narrative reflects more contemporary concernsânamely, the ways in which toxic masculinity can prevent fathers from showing love to their sons. The hero, Kratos, is something of a reborn video-game protagonist: in his previous six outings, he was no more than a monosyllabic muscleman. God of War, like its forebears, treats violence as pornography, but it also has a narrative heft, and the dynamic between Kratos and his son, as they undertake a journey to scatter the boyâs motherâs ashes on a giant mountain, is tenderly observed. In the age of the strongman, itâs revitalizing to see a powerful man explore emotional vulnerability as a martial art. And, when the psychodrama threatens to grow weary, the game is always ready with the next god or monster who needs taking down.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Forza Horizon 4 (Xbox One)__\n\nThere is pleasure to be had, of course, in driving a glittering array of supercars within a video game, where insurance premiums are yet to be found. But the real joy in the fourth game from Playground Gamesâa studio based in the nondescript English town of Leamington Spaâis the chance to drive those cars across the British countryside, from the wuthering Devon moors to the cobbled majesty of Edinburgh. The game plays down the realism, allowing you to hurl even the lowest-slung Italian sports car over rocks and dales, perhaps while listening to Bachâs Air on G String on the in-game radio. Racing games are ten-a-penny in this business, but no one makes them quite like the British. The Playground team, freed from having to locate their work in, say, Colorado or on the NÃ¼rburgring, have made a game that exudes a love for their homeland, in all its green, pleasant, and now tire-wrecked wonder.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Monster Hunter: World (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)__\n\nMonster hunting has been a theme in video games since PokÃ©mon challenged us to catch âem all. But Monster Hunter: World takes its cues from older source material, namely Victorian classics, such as Jules Verneâs â[Journey to the Center of the Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Center-Earth-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486440885/)â and Sir Arthur Conan Doyleâs â[The Lost World](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-World-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486400603).â You arrive in a forgotten continent filled with exotic megafauna, which must be stalked, lured, hunted, and, finally, either captured or killed, depending on whether your predilection is to study or destroy. Unlike most action games, which send you, blade extended, pirouetting through hundreds of enemies on the battlefield, here your prey is singular, and hard to take down. Hunts, which can be undertaken solo or with friends online, can take more than an hour, a delay that only heightens the sense of euphoria when you finally fell the beast. In a world thatâs been meticulously plotted by satellites, here is a rare chance to rediscover the undiscovered.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Honorable Mentions__\n\nMinit (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC)\n\nSpider-Man (PlayStation 4)\n\nDead Cells (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC)\n\nCeleste (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC)","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c992bc86f2c9a2449d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Video Games","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"video-games"},{"id":"5c2e1c7836cecf40192141c4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2018 in Review","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2018-in-review"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"technology"},{"id":"5c2e1c982bc86f2c9a2449d8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gaming","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gaming"}],"sections":[{"id":"5bfec45e7556b72d483911ef","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2018 in Review","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2018-in-review"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04a38b51cf59fc424715","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Simon Parkin is a contributing writer to *The New Yorker*.

It was a view shared by other contemporary critics. One [called the book](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1534&context=wwqr) âintensely vulgar, nay, absolutely beastly,â before bluntly refusing to tell readers where it might be bought. Whitman did not idly nurse his wounds. Instead, he anonymously wrote numerous flattering appraisals of his work, to even the balance. A [three-thousand-word example](https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/lg1855/anc.00176.html), published in the September, 1855, edition of the United States *Review*, opens with the breathless declaration, âAn American bard at last!â Whitman goes on to extravagantly applaud his dress sense (âmanly and freeâ), his posture (âstrong and erectâ), his voice (âbringing hope and prophecy to the generous races of young and oldâ), and his compassion (âthe largest lover and sympathizer that has appeared in literature.â)\n\nThe temptation to pose as an impartial reviewer of oneâs own work will be familiar to many authors across history. But the Internet has, as with all vices, smoothed the transition from temptation to action. When presented with the user-review box on Amazon, itâs a simple matter for an author to tap on the five-star icon and offer an âExquisiteâ or a âTriumph!â For those caught in the act, the humiliation can be severe. In 2012, the crime writer R. J. Ellory was accused on Twitter by one of his rivals, Jeremy Duns, of writing âlong, purple tributes to his own work on Amazon.â Under the pseudonym Nicodemus Jones, Duns said, Ellory had described his book â[A Quiet Belief in Angels](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Belief-Angels-Novel/dp/1590203380)â as âmagnificentâ and âpoetic,â even going so far as to warn potential buyers to âignore all dissenters and naysayers.â Ellory, Duns claimed, had not stopped at self-praise; he had also posted negative reviews of other authorsâ work. In [a statement issued to the *Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/03/rj-ellory-secret-amazon-reviews), Ellory admitted guilt. âThe recent reviewsâboth positive and negativeâthat have been posted on my Amazon accounts are my responsibility and my responsibility alone,â he wrote. âI wholeheartedly regret the lapse of judgment.â\n\nSock-puppeting, the act of posing as someone else on the Internet to artificially amplify a viewpoint, is, many writers claim, rife in publishing. The author Stephen Leather once reportedly admitted, at the Harrogate Crime Writing Festival, to building an online ânetwork of charactersâ who would talk among themselves about his books in glittering terms. \n\nOutside the publishing industry, the practice known as âreview brushingâ exists on a vast, industrial scale. In 2014, Haitao Xu, a thirty-year-old researcher now at Northwestern University, monitored five black-market Internet boards where companies and individuals advertise jobs posting positive reviews of their products and services, along with negative ones on those of their rivals. In just two months, Xu saw more than eleven thousand unique sellers post close to a quarter of a million jobs, paid at anywhere between âtens of cents, up to five dollars,â he told me. Since consumers typically see positive customer reviews as a more reliable indicator of quality than advertising, the effects can be major. âStores using brushing services can increase their reputation ten times faster than normal seller stores,â Xu, who, in 2016, spent six months working in Alibabaâs fraud-detection team, told me. âA store with a high reputation is displayed higher up a Web page, attracting more customers and increasing sales.â Online sellers who do not employ brushing services, meanwhile, often find their products overlooked. \n\nLate last year, Oobah Butler, a reporter at Vice, decided to [test the effectiveness of brushing in restaurant reviews](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/434gqw/i-made-my-shed-the-top-rated-restaurant-on-tripadvisor). Years ago, Butler told me, he used to write bogus reviews on TripAdvisor for money. He found his clients via freelance job postings, like those that Xu studied, and charged around twenty dollars a pop. âIâd look at the menu, pick something, and start lying,â he said. For the recent test, he created his own fake business, which he called the Shed at Dulwich. (It was named for his garden shed, in Dulwich, London.) He photographed plates of carefully arranged food (created using household products such as shaving cream and dishwasher tablets), bought a burner phone, and added the Shed to the site. Within four weeks, he had posted enough fake reviews to move the spectral establishment into the top two thousand restaurants in London. Eventually, it became the highest-rated restaurant in the city, and Butler was fielding scores of calls from people hoping to book a table. Such was the nonexistent restaurantâs success that it even attracted a one-star review, from what Butler assumes was a rival. âTripAdvisor removed the review on the grounds that it was fake,â he said.\n\nFor online retailers, the war on the fake-review industry is now a major part of the business. Today, when a review is submitted to TripAdvisor, it goes through a tracking system that examines hundreds of different attributes, from basic data points, such as the I.P. address of the reviewer, to more detailed information, such as the screen resolution of the device that was used to submit the review. âWe use this data to create a map of reviews coming in for every property listed on the site, and it means we can quickly identify unusual patterns of review behavior,â James Kay, a spokesman for the company, told me. The tools, he said, have successfully identified offshore review farms. In 2015, TripAdvisor took legal action against sixty of them. \n\nIncreasingly, fake reviews are being leveraged not only for financial gain but to make a political point. Within hours of the release of Hillary Clintonâs campaign memoir, â[What Happened](https://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/dp/1501175564/),â last September, so many people had left one-star ratings on Amazon that the company [deleted almost a thousand reviews](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/14/amazon-redacts-one-star-reviews-of-hillary-clintons-what-happened). The same month, the San Francisco-based video-game company Campo Santo saw one of its titles, [Firewatch](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/with-firewatch-olly-moss-brings-his-subversive-touch-to-video-games), review-bombed on Amazon, Steam, and other sites. The campaign started after the Swedish YouTube broadcaster Felix Kjellberg, a.k.a. [PewDiePie](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/hollywood-vine), posted a video in which he used a racial epithet. Campo Santo filed a takedown request under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, preventing PewDiePie from streaming any of its games; that was enough to mobilize a small army of fake reviewers looking to punish the developer. \n\nAn Amazon spokeswoman explained that when a product is hit with many reviews in a short period of time, the companyâs systems will automatically suppress all but âverifiedâ purchases. But this preventative measure, too, can be easily gamed. âPeople would buy our game, not play it, leave the terrible review, and instantly request a refund,â Sean Vanaman, Campo Santoâs co-founder, told me. âItâs a well-worn tactic.â In his estimation, user-review systems such as those used by Valve, Steamâs developer, are so vulnerable to exploitation that they require as much moderation as social-media platforms. âThe ethics and utility of these systems boil down to this: if a platform is going to have it, they have to be able to manage it to protect people from abuse and harassment, or they become responsible for that abuse,â Vanaman told me last September. (His studio, Campo Santo, was bought by Valve earlier this year.)\n\nButler, the reporter who created the fake restaurant on TripAdvisor, is skeptical that the war on fake reviews is being won. âPut it this way: Iâm still not banned from TripAdvisor,â he said. Kay, the companyâs spokesman, claims that the Shed at Dulwich was identified as fraudulent and removed from the site completely before Butler published the story about his escapade. Butler remains unconvinced. âOne way or another, the platform needs to be more sophisticated if weâre going to trust it more than whatâs in front of our eyes,â he said.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762396212cbb9fc989","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reviews","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reviews"},{"id":"5c2e1c782bfcc72cd92d0524","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Internet","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"internet"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c22d4972cd5b83297","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Amazon","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"amazon"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f161ebe912338a3717da","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04a38b51cf59fc424715","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Simon Parkin is a contributing writer to *The New Yorker*.

Photographs showed workersâwho are forced to sign blank contracts, work overtime, and go without safety equipmentâslumped over assembly lines and sleeping in hallways. One image showed the exact American Girl doll that Iâd been considering buying as a Christmas present for my six-year-old daughter. I surveyed her toys, strewn jubilantly around the living room: a Cool Maker Sew Nâ Style machine, made in Vietnam; a Klutz Make Your Own Soap science kit, made in Taiwan; a pair of Kuxuan Doodle Design roller skates, made in China. The factories [highlighted](http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/report/138) by China Labor Watch have made toys for many companies, including Hasbro, Disney, Lego, and Mattel. How could I know which had been made ethically and which hadnât?\n\n \n\nAnswering this question can be surprisingly difficult. A few years ago, while teaching a class about global labor at the University of California, Los Angeles, I tried assigning my students the task of analyzing the âsupply chainââthe vast network of factories, warehouses, and shipping conduits through which products flowâby tracing the components used in their electronic devices. Almost immediately, I hit a snag: it turns out that even companies that boast about âend-to-end visibilityâ and âsupply-chain transparencyâ may not know exactly where their components come from. This ignorance is built into the way supply chains work. The housing of a television, say, might be built in a small factory employing only a few people; that factory interacts only with the suppliers and buyers immediately adjacent to it in the chainâa plastic supplier on one side, an assembly company on the other. This arrangement encourages modularity, since, if a company goes out of business, its immediate partners can replace it without consulting anyone. But it also makes it hard to identify individual links in the chain. The resilient, self-healing quality of supply chains derives, in part, from the fact that they are unsupervised.\n\n \n\nWhen people try to picture supply chains, they often focus on their physical infrastructure. In Allan Sekulaâs book â[Fish Story](https://www.amazon.com/Fish-Story-KINDLE-Allan-Sekula-ebook/dp/B00PSSEIC0/),â a volume of essays and photographs produced between 1989 and 1995, the writer and photographer trains his lens on ports, harbors, and the workers who pilot ships between them; he reveals dim shipboard workspaces and otherworldly industrial zones. In âThe Forgotten Space,â a documentary that Sekula made with the film theorist NoÃ«l Burch, in 2010, we see massive, gliding vessels, enormous machines, and people rummaging through the detritus around ports and harbors. Sekulaâs work suggests the degree to which our fantasy of friction-free procurement hides the real, often gruelling, work of global shipping and trade.\n\n \n\nBut supply chains arenât purely physical. Theyâre also made of information. Modern supply-chain management, or S.C.M., is done through software. The people who design and coÃ¶rdinate supply chains donât see warehouses or workers. They stare at screens filled with icons and tables. Their view of the supply chain is abstract. It may be the one that matters most.\n\n \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nIn the S.C.M. space, a German company called *SAP*{: .small} is the market leader. Its name stands for Systeme, Anwendungen, und Produkte, or Systems, Applications, and Products. You canât download *SAP*{: .small} from the app store; itâs an enterprise-wide suite of software, which includes modules for accounting and human resources and needs to work in tandem with a large database. Itâs possible, though, to take a class online. A Texas-based company called Learn*SAP*{: .small} offers an online training course, which includes access to demo software. The course takes forty hours and costs a thousand dollars. Last summer, I signed up. (*SAP*{: .small} also offers free introductory training sessions on a platform called open*SAP*{: .small}.) \n\n \n\nBefore I logged in for the first time, I assumed that Iâd be one of many students. In fact, the class was one on one. My instructor, Enugula Srinivasa Rao, lived in India, where he had a day job as a supply-chain manager for a large company. Every night for forty nightsâ8 *P.M.*{: .small} for me, 9:30 *A.M.*{: .small} for himâRao and I met online. His manner, elaborately courteous and infallibly patient, inspired a similar politeness in me, so that we often performed a dance of apologies and thank-yous while navigating *SAPâs*{: .small} screens.\n\n \n\nThe newest versions of *SAP*{: .small} are sleek and colorful. But the version that I trained onâ*SAP*{: .small} SCM 7, the one thatâs most widely usedâhas a bare-bones interface, with a look and feel that evokes Microsoft Windows circa 1997\\. The main screen shows a cascade of file folders, each housing an array of âtransactionsââindividual tasks, such as ordering, manufacturing, packing, and shippingâthat a manager can fit together to form a supply chain. Devising a chain is a multi-person process involving several different *SAP*{: .small} âcomponents.â Into one component, a âdemand specialistâ enters information about past sales, seasonal variations, planned promotions, and the like; the software calculates how many products need to be made. In another, a âsupply-chain specialistâ uses information about shipping times, storage costs, factory capacities, and so on to create a âsupply-network plan,â which dictates when each gear in the manufacturing process must turn. This high-altitude plan is then transmitted to another specialist who works in a component called PP/DS, for Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling. The PP/DS component determines how the process will unfold on the ground, allowing for the scheduling of work shifts and product movements in intervals as small as a second.\n\n \n\nThe PP/DS component looks as blandly institutional as the rest of *SAP*{: .small}. Itâs more or less a series of spreadsheets, check boxes, and pop-up windows. Still, itâs where forecasts and market predictions get translated into workersâ marching orders. PP/DS features âheuristicsââbuilt-in algorithms that distribute labor so that plants operate at their highest capacity. Running a heuristic entails clicking a button on the PP/DS interface that looks like a tiny magic wand. Click the wand, and a factoryâs schedule auto-fills.\n\n \n\nDespite such labor-saving shortcuts, using *SAP*{: .small} is not easy. As the class proceeded, I felt as though I, too, were falling behind on an assembly line. Every task was more complicated than Iâd imagined, with a seemingly endless variety of settings to configure; I struggled to keep the various interlocking systems arranged in my head. (It didnât help that I sometimes clicked through *SAP*{: .small} with one hand while participating in my daughterâs craft projects with the other.) Over time, though, I started to understand the dynamics of the system as a whole. Log in to PeopleSoft, or a similar human-resource management system, and you only have access to certain modulesâthe ones relevant to your particular job. The same is true in *SAP*{: .small}. Most of the time, the work of supply-chain management is divided up, with handoffs where one specialist passes a package of data to another. No individual is liable to possess a detailed picture of the whole supply chain. Instead, each S.C.M. specialist knows only what her neighbors need.\n\n \n\nIn such a system, a sense of inevitability takes hold. Data dictates a set of conditions which must be met, but there is no explanation of how that data was derived; meanwhile, the software takes an active role, tweaking the plan to meet the conditions as efficiently as possible. *SAPâs*{: .small} built-in optimizers work out how to meet production needs with the least âlatencyâ and at the lowest possible costs. (The software even suggests how tightly a container should be packed, to save on shipping charges.)  This entails that particular components become available at particular times. The consequences of this relentless optimization are well-documented. The corporations that commission products pass their computationally determined demands on to their subcontractors, who then put extraordinary pressure on their employees. Thus, China Labor Watch found that workers in Heyuan City, China, tasked with producing Disneyâs Princess Sing & Sparkle Ariel Bath Dollâretail price today, $26\\.40âwork twenty-six days a month, assembling between eighteen hundred and twenty-five hundred dolls per day, and earning one cent for each doll they complete.\n\n \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nFrom the beginning of my Learn*SAP*{: .small} course, I looked forward to investigating the âSupply-Chain Cockpit,â a display that features a graphic representation of a companyâs factory locations, shipping routes, and warehouses. I loved the idea of a manager strapping in like a fighter pilot to fly over a supply chain, watching it work. Rao quickly dampened my enthusiasm. âItâs not dynamic,â he explained. âIt just shows the plan.â The cockpit presents only a moment of the planning process, frozen in time.\n\n \n\nA central challenge in supply-chain management is the vast distanceâspatial, temporal, and informationalâthat separates the S.C.M. process from the real world of manufacturing and consumption. Among the distance-based problems planners worry about is the âbullwhip effect.â Suppose a store runs low on diapers. Observing this strong demand, a manager who normally needs fifty cases might put in an order for a hundred, just to be on the safe side. The diaper company, in turn, might order the production of two hundred cases, rather than a hundred, to insure that they have enough stock on hand. Just as a flick of the wrist creates waves which grow as they travel through a whip, so subtle signals sent by consumers can be amplified out of proportion as they travel through the supply chain. This inflation is dangerous for manufacturersâespecially those that depend on the razor-thin inventory margins demanded by just-in-time planningâand yet itâs also hard to avoid, since the manufacturing process is so distributed in time and space, with many junctures at which forecasts might grow.\n\n \n\n*SAPâs*{: .small} demand-forecasting component is designed to help companies avoid this fate. Still, from a workerâs point of view, S.C.M. software can generate its own bullwhip effect. At the beginning of the planning process, product requirements are fairly high-level. But by the time these requirements reach workers, they have become more exacting, more punishing. Small reductions in âlatency,â for instance, can magnify in consequence, reducing a workerâs time for eating her lunch, taking a breath, donning safety equipment, or seeing a loved one.\n\n \n\nCould S.C.M. software include a âworkersâ-rightsâ componentâa counterpart to PP/DS, incorporating data on working conditions? Technically, itâs possible. *SAP*{: .small} could begin asking for input about worker welfare. But a component like that would be at cross-purposes with almost every other function of the system. On some level, it might even undermine the purpose of having a system in the first place. Supply chains create efficiency in part through the distribution of responsibility. If a supervisor at a toy factory objects to the production plan sheâs received, her boss can wield, in his defense, a PP/DS plan sent to him by someone else, who worked with data produced by yet another person. It will turn out that no one in particular is responsible for the pressures placed on the factory. They flow from the systemâa system designed to be flexible in some ways and rigid in others.

Hide the WD-40\\. Lock up your nine-volt batteries. Build a booby trap out of giant magnets; dig a moat as deep as a grave. âEver since a study by the University of Oxford predicted that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence over the next fifteen to twenty years, I havenât been able to stop thinking about the future of work,â AndrÃ©s Oppenheimer writes, in â[The Robots Are Coming: The Future of Jobs in the Age of Automation](https://www.amazon.com/Robots-Are-Coming-Future-Automation/dp/0525565000/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Robots+Are+Coming%3A+The+Future+of+Jobs+in+the+Age+of+Automation&qid=1551108903&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Vintage). No one is safe. Chapter 4: âTheyâre Coming for Bankers!â Chapter 5: âTheyâre Coming for Lawyers!â Theyâre attacking hospitals: âTheyâre Coming for Doctors!â Theyâre headed to Hollywood: âTheyâre Coming for Entertainers!â I gather they have not yet come for the manufacturers of exclamation points.\n\nThe old robots were blue-collar workers, burly and clunky, the machines that rusted the Rust Belt. But, according to the economist Richard Baldwin, in â[The Globotics Upheaval: Globalization, Robotics, and the Future of Work](https://www.amazon.com/Globotics-Upheaval-Globalization-Robotics-Future/dp/0190901764/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Globotics+Upheaval%3A+Globalization%2C+Robotics%2C+and+the+Future+of+Work&qid=1551108918&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Oxford), the new ones are âwhite-collar robots,â knowledge workers and quinoa-and-oat-milk globalists, the machines that will bankrupt Brooklyn. Mainly, theyâre algorithms. Except when theyâre immigrants. Baldwin calls that kind âremote intelligence,â or R.I.: theyâre not exactly robots but, somehow, they fall into the same category. Theyâre people from other countries who can steal your job without ever really crossing the border: they just hop over, by way of the Internet and apps like Upwork, undocumented, invisible, ethereal. Between artificial intelligence and remote intelligence, Baldwin warns, âthis international talent tidal wave is coming straight for the good, stable jobs that have been the foundation of middle-class prosperity in the US and Europe, and other high-wage economies.â Change your Wi-Fi password. Clear your browser history. Ask H.R. about early retirement. The globots are coming.\n\nHow can you know if youâre about to get replaced by an invading algorithm or an augmented immigrant? âIf your job can be easily explained, it can be automated,â Anders Sandberg, of Oxfordâs Future of Humanity Institute, tells Oppenheimer. âIf it canât, it wonât.â (Rotten luck for people whose job description is âPredict the future.â) Baldwin offers three-part advice: (1) avoid competing with A.I. and R.I.; (2) build skills in things that only humans can do, in person; and (3) ârealize that humanity is an edge not a handicap.â What all this means is hard to say, especially if youâve never before considered being human to be a handicap. As for the future of humanity, Oppenheimer offers another cockamamie rule of three: âSociety will be divided into three general groups. The first will be members of the elites, who will be able to adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape and who will earn the most money, followed by a second group made up primarily of those who provide personalized services to the elite, including personal trainers, Zumba class instructors, meditation gurus, piano teachers, and personal chefs, and finally a third group of those who will be mostly unemployed and may be receiving a universal basic income as compensation for being the victims of technological unemployment.â\n\nReaders of Douglas Adams will recognize this sort of hooey from â[The Hitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.amazon.com/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345391802/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Hitchhiker%E2%80%99s+Guide+to+the+Galaxy&qid=1551108935&s=books&sr=1-1).â Long ago, in a galaxy not at all far away, the people of the planet Golgafrincham were divided into three groups: A, âall the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achieversâ; B, âhairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultantsâ (the group that everyone else considers to be âa bunch of useless idiotsâ); and, C, âall the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things.â The B people, told they must lead an expedition to colonize another planet, rocket away in a starship, having been led to believe that their planet is doomed. âApparently it was going to crash into the sun or something,â the B shipâs captain tells Arthur Dent, vaguely wondering why the other ships never followed. âOr maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was.â Dent inquires, âAnd they made sure they sent you lot off first, did they?â\n\nThis time, notwithstanding [Elon Musk](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/elon-musk)âs ambition to colonize Mars, no oneâs trying to persuade the B people to board a spaceship, because the B peopleâthe hairdressers and the Zumba-class instructors, the meditation gurus and the personal trainersâare supposed to stick around to cater to the A people. No, this time itâs the C people, the people who make and do thingsâthings that can now be made and done faster and cheaper by robotsâwho are being flushed down the cosmic toilet. The historian and sometime futurist Yuval Noah Harari has a name for the C people: he calls them the âuseless class.â Some futurists suggest that, in our Asimov-y future, these sort of people might wind up spending their empty days playing video games. Otherwise, theyâll wage a revolution, an eventuality that the self-proclaimed âcognitive eliteââthe A people, who believe themselves to be cleverer than the cleverest robotsâintend to wait out in fortified lairs. (Peter Thiel owns nearly five hundred acres of land in New Zealand, complete with its own water supply.) More popular is the proposal to pay the C people for doing nothing, in order to avert the revolution. âItâs going to be necessary,â Musk said during a summit in Dubai two years ago, joining a small herd of other billionaires, including [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Mark%20Zuckerberg), of Facebook, and Stewart Butterfield, of Slack, who endorse universal basic income. Itâs either that or build a wall.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFear of a robot invasion is the obverse of fear of an immigrant invasion, a partisan coin: heads, youâre worried about robots; tails, youâre worried about immigrants. Thereâs just the one coin. Both fears have to do with jobs, whose loss produces suffering, want, and despair, and whose future scarcity represents a terrifying prospect. Misery likes a scapegoat: heads, blame machines; tails, foreigners. But is the present alarm warranted? Panic is not evidence of danger; itâs evidence of panic. Stoking fear of invading robots and of invading immigrants has been going on for a long time, and the predictions of disaster have, generally, been bananas. Oh, but this time itâs different, the robotomizers insist.\n\nThis thesis has been rolling around like a marble in the bowl of a lot of peopleâs brains for a while now, and many of those marbles were handed out by Martin Ford, in his 2015 book, âRise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future.â In the book, and in an essay in â[Confronting Dystopia: The New Technological Revolution and the Future of Work](https://www.amazon.com/Confronting-Dystopia-Technological-Revolution-Future-ebook/dp/B0773XKNK8/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Confronting+Dystopia%3A+The+New+Technological+Revolution+and+the+Future+of+Work&qid=1551108992&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Cornell), Ford acknowledges that all other earlier robot-invasion panics were unfounded. In the nineteenth century, people who worked on farms lost their jobs when agricultural processes were mechanized, but they eventually earned more money working in factories. In the twentieth century, automation of industrial production led to warnings about âunprecedented economic and social disorder.â Instead, displaced factory workers moved into service jobs. Machines eliminate jobs; rising productivity creates new jobs.\n\nâGiven this long record of false alarms, contemporary economists are generally dismissive of arguments that technological progress might lead to unemployment as well as falling wages and soaring income inequality,â Ford admits. After all, âhistory shows that the economy has consistently adjusted to advancing technology by creating new employment opportunities and that these new jobs often require more skills and pay higher wages.â\n\nThat was then. The reason that things will be different this time, Ford argues, has to do with the changing pace of change. The transformation from an agricultural to an industrial economy was linear; the current acceleration is exponential. The first followed Newtonâs law; the second follows Mooreâs. The employment apocalypse, when it comes, will happen so fast that workers wonât have time to adjust by shifting to new employment sectors, and, even if they did have time to adjust, there would be no new employment sectors to go to, because robots will be able to do just about everything.\n\nIt is quite possible that this thesis is correct; it is not possible to know that it is correct. Ford, an advocate of universal basic income, is neither a historian nor an economist. He is a futurist, a modern-day shaman, with an M.B.A. Everybody thinks about the future; futurists do it for a living. Policymakers make plans; futurists read omens. The robots-are-coming omen-reading borrows as much from the conventions of science fiction as from those of historical analysis. It uses ârobotâ as a shorthand for everything from steam-powered looms to electricity-driven industrial assemblers and artificial intelligence, and thus has the twin effects of compressing time and conflating one thing with another. It indulges in the supposition that work is something the wealthy hand out to the poor, from feudalism to capitalism, instead of something people do, for reasons that include a search for order, meaning, and purpose. It leaves out of its accounting the largest source of labor in the United States before the Civil War, people held in bondage, and fails to consider how the rise of wage labor left womenâs work uncompensated. And it ignores the brutal truth that, in American history, panic about technological change is almost always tangled up with panic about immigration. Nineteenth-century populists, those farmers left behind by the industrial revolution, wanted railroad companies to be taxed, but they also wanted to bar African-Americans and Asian immigrants from full citizenship. They raged against the machine; they fought for the color line.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFuturists foretell inevitable outcomes by conjuring up inevitable pasts. People who are in the business of selling predictions need to present the past as predictableâthe ground truth, the test case. Machines are more predictable than people, and in histories written by futurists the machines just keep coming; depicting their march as unstoppable certifies the futuristsâ predictions. But machines donât just keep coming. They are funded, invented, built, sold, bought, and used by people who could just as easily not fund, invent, build, sell, buy, and use them. Machines donât drive history; people do. History is not a smart car.\n\nIn â[Temp: How American Work, American Business, and the American Dream Became Temporary](https://www.amazon.com/Temp-American-Business-Became-Temporary/dp/0735224072/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Temp%3A+How+American+Work%2C+American+Business%2C+and+the+American+Dream+Became+Temporary&qid=1551109012&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Viking), the historian Louis Hyman argues that in the course of the past century management consultants, taking the wheel, reinvented work by making employers more like machines, turning work into the kind of thing that robots could do long before there were any robots able to do it. His story begins in the nineteen-twenties, with the rise of management consulting, and takes a turn in the fifties, with the first major wave of automation, a word coined in 1948\\. âMachines should be used instead of people whenever possible,â a staffer for the National Office Managers Association advised in 1952\\. To compete, workers had to become as flexible as machines: able to work on a task basis; ineligible for unions; free at night; willing to work any shift; requiring no health care or other benefits, not so much as a day off at Christmas; easy to hire; and easier to fire.\n\nâThe rise of computers and the rise of temps went hand in hand,â Hyman writes. By 1958, Elmer Winter had founded Manpower, Inc., and companies all over the country had come to rely on the services of management consultants to trim their employment costs. Hyman argues, âBeginning in the midst of the postwar boom in the 1950s, American jobs were slowly remade from top to bottom: consultants supplanted executives at the top, temps replaced office workers in the middle, and day laborers pushed out union workers at the bottom. On every step of the ladder, work would become more insecure as it became more flexible.â\n\nGradually, Hyman says, âthe key features of the postwar corporationâstable workforce, retained earnings, and minimized riskâbecame liabilities rather than assets.â Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, Harvard Business Schoolâs Michael Porter introduced the logic underlying outsourcing. By the nineteen-eighties, corporations had to get âlean.â (I worked for Porter in those days, as a Manpower temp.) By the nineteen-nineties, they needed to âdownsize.â If businesses exist not to make things and employ people but instead to maximize profits for investors, labor can be done by temps, by poorly paid workers in other countries, or by robots, whichever is cheapest.\n\nThe robots, though, were mainly for show. In the nineteen-eighties, Apple called its headquarters the Robot Factory. âTo understand the electronics industry is simple: every time someone says ârobot,â simply picture a woman of color,â Hyman advises. One in five electronics companies used no automation at all, and the rest used very little. Seagateâs disk drives were assembled by women in Singapore. Hewlett-Packard hired so many temporary workers that it started its own temp agency. The most important technology in the electronics industry, as Hyman points out, was the fingernail.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c6f02d1cc63602cef2e4152]||||||\n+++\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties, the sociologist Patricia Fernandez-Kelly conducted a study of the electronics and garment industries in Southern California. More than seventy per cent of the labor force was women of color, and more than seventy per cent of those women were Hispanic. In San Diego, Fernandez-Kelly interviewed a woman she called Fermina Calero (a pseudonym, to protect her from deportation). Calero was born in Mexico. In 1980, when she was twenty-one, she began working in Tijuana, soldering filaments of metal for sixty-five cents an hour. In 1983, Calero crossed into the United States, illegally, to work at Kaypro, the maker of the Kaypro II, a personal computer that briefly rivalled the Apple II. In the nineteen-sixties and seventies, Andrew Kay, the companyâs founder, had hired management consultants to help him reimagine his labor force. In the eighties, when people speaking English responded to the companyâs newspaper Help Wanted ads, they were told that there were no openings; when people speaking Spanish called, they were invited to apply. By the time Calero started working for Kaypro, its workforce consisted of seven hundred people, nearly all undocumented Mexican immigrants. The companyâs general manager said, âThey are reliable; they work hard; they donât make trouble.â At Kaypro, Calero earned nearly five dollars an hour. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service raided the factory, she hid in a supply closet. She was not a robot.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn 1984, the year that Calero hid in a closet at Kaypro, computer scientists at the annual meeting of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence began warning about the coming of an âA.I. winterâ: artificial intelligence had been overhyped by a credulous press and overfunded by incautious investors, and, given these wild and wide-eyed expectations, it had underdelivered. The hype was about to die down, and the funding to dry up. The A.I. winter lasted for years.\n\nSkeptics of the current robots-are-coming argument predict the arrival of another A.I. winter. âWe have not moved a byte forward in understanding human intelligence,â Zia Chishti wrote in the _Financial Times_ last fall. âWe have much faster computers, thanks to Mooreâs law, but the underlying algorithms are mostly identical to those that powered machines 40 years ago.â That goes back to the time of the Kaypro.\n\nA lot has changed in those forty years, not least in the availability of enormous sets of data that artificial intelligences can use to study and learn. Still, the economist RobertÂ J. Gordon is unconvinced that the robots are coming. In his 2016 book, â[The Rise and Fall of American Growth](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691175802/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Rise+and+Fall+of+American+Growth&qid=1551109043&s=books&sr=1-1),â he argued that a century of economic expansion that began in 1870âdriven by human-condition changing developments like electricity, a public water supply, and the interstate-highway systemâended in 1970, and that, since then, inventions have been merely incremental. The telephone was patented in 1876\\. It changed peopleâs lives, and contributed to a huge rise in productivity. The cell phone, Gordon argues, just isnât that different from a telephone. In a 2016 essay, â[Why Robots Will Not Decimate Human Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-robots-decimate-human-jobs-bob-gordon),â Gordon points out that the uses to which smartphones get put are ânot a part of the market economy that creates jobs and pays wages.â Robots have altered manufacturing, he concedes, but he doesnât think that theyâve altered the economy, or that theyâre about to. âI play a game called âfind the robot,âÂ â he writes. âIn my daily strolls in and out of supermarkets, restaurants, doctor and dentist offices, my nearby hospital, offices in my own university, and the vast amount of employment involving elementary and secondary teachers, personal trainers, and old age caretakers, I have yet to find a robot.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nStill, even if the hype about robots is mostly unwarranted, the worry about jobs is real. If the latest jobs numbers look good, the longer-term trends look bad, especially for Americans without a high-school diploma, or less, a population whose real wages have been falling for decades. In a downward compression of the labor market, these jobs have been taken not so much by robots as by college graduates: as much as forty per cent of college graduates are currently working at jobs that do not require a college degree, Ellen Ruppel Shell reports, in â[The Job: Work and Its Future in a Time of Radical Change](https://www.amazon.com/Job-Work-Future-Radical-Change/dp/0451497252/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Job%3A+Work+and+Its+Future+in+a+Time+of+Radical+Change&qid=1551109109&s=books&sr=1-1-catcorr)â (Currency). Four out of every five children born in the United States in 1950 went on to earn more than their parents. For children born in 1980, that ratio had fallen to one in two. Lately, itâs down to one in three. Estimates range from the cautious to the entirely hysterical, but one reasonable study predicts that, by 2050, one in four working-age American men will be unemployed, having been replaced by some form of automation. Most imminently threatened are the millions of people who work as drivers of cars and trucks, scheduled to be replaced by fleets of self-driving vehicles beginning as early as next year.\n\nEconomic inequality produces political instability and partisan death matches. Everyone worries about jobs, but people who worry about robots and people who worry about immigrants propose very different solutions. Either way, much writing in this field is, essentially, fantasy. In âThe Globotics Upheaval,â Baldwin predicts that the march of the robots will have four stages: transformation, upheaval, backlash, and resolution. The resolution will involve what he calls âshelterism.â Once white-collar workers realize that their jobs are on the line, too, theyâll find ways to protect themselves by âshelteringâ certain activities, things that only humans can do. He explains, âThis will mean that our work lives will be filled with far more caring, sharing, understanding, creating, empathizing, innovating, and managing people who are actually in the same room. This is a logical inevitabilityâeverything else will be done by globots.â The catch is that, historically, caring, sharing, understanding, and empathizing with people who are in the same room as you has been the work of women, and is therefore either unpaid, and not recognized as work, or paid very badly. Childcare, elementary-school teaching, nursing, geriatric care, and social work will not suddenly become high-paying, high-prestige professions simply because everything else is done by robots. If that were going to happen, it would already be happening, because we already know that these jobs require beings who are human. Instead, something darker is going on, mirrored in the feminizing of robots, from the male robots of the nineteen-sixties and seventiesâHal, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Mr. Robinsonâs robot on âLost in Spaceââto the fembots and sexbots of âHerâ and âEx Machina,â and, not least, the sexy and slavish Alexa. Female workers arenât being paid more for being human; instead, robots are selling better when theyâre female.\n\nThe economist Oren Cass, the author of â[The Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America](https://www.amazon.com/Once-Future-Worker-Renewal-America/dp/1641770147/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Once+and+Future+Worker%3A+A+Vision+for+the+Renewal+of+Work+in+America&qid=1551109128&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)â (Encounter), much of which originally appeared in _National Review_, is fed up with the robot hysteria. âTechnological innovation and automation have always been integral to our economic progress, and in a well-functioning labor market, they should produce gains for all types of workers,â he insists. He has no patience with advocates of universal basic income, either. âWe have reached a point where the rich think paying everyone else to go away represents compassionate thinking,â he writes.\n\nLike Hyman, Cass blames mid-twentieth-century economic thinkers for the current malaise, though he blames different thinkers. In the middle decades of the twentieth century, he argues, economic policymakers abandoned workers and the health of the labor market in favor of a commitment to over-all economic growth, with redistribution as an adjustment and consumerism as its objective. That required quantifying prosperity, hence the G.D.P., a measure that Cass, along with other writers, finds to be disastrous, not least because it values consumers above producers. Cass sees universal basic income as the end-stage scenario of every other redistribution program, whose justification is that the poor will be fine without work as long as they can buy things. Here he mocks the advocates of the current economic arrangement, who are prone to note that the poor are not actually starving, âand so many people have iPhones!â\n\nReporters are suckers for the hype, Cass maintains, pointing out that after a 2017 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that, in the next hundred years, robots might eliminate as many manufacturing jobs as were lost in 2001 (presumably, a tolerable loss), the _Times_ ran a story with the headline â*Evidence That Robots Are Winning the Race for American Jobs*{: .small},â while the Washington _Post_ titled its story â*Weâre So Unprepared for the Robot Apocalypse*{: .small}.â Cass offers a careful criticism of the robots-are-stealing-our-jobs theory. He cites four of its errors. It overestimates twenty-first-century innovations and underestimates the innovations of earlier centuries. It miscalculates the pace of change. It assumes that automation will not create new sectors. (3-D printing might replace a lot of manufacturing workers, but it could also create a lot of new small businesses.) And it fails to appreciate the complexity of many of the jobs it thinks robots can do. The 2013 Oxford study that kept AndrÃ©s Oppenheimer up at night Cass finds to be mostly silly. Its authors, Carl Frey and Michael Osborne, rated seven hundred and two occupations from least âcomputerizableâ to most. Highly vulnerable are school-bus drivers, and, while a self-driving school bus does not seem technically too far off, Cass points out, few parents can imagine putting their kids on a bus without a grownup to make sure they donât bash one another the whole way to school.\n\nCassâs own policy proposals center, very reasonably, on the importance of work and family, but he fails to demonstrate how his proposalsâlowering environmental regulations and establishing academic tracking in high schoolsâwill achieve his objectives. And though âThe Once and Future Workerâ offers a rousing call for an honest reckoning with American economic policy, it also indulges in its own sleight of hand. âThe story goes that âautomationâ or the âknowledge economy,â not bad public policy, is to blame,â Cass writes. âHistorically, economists and policy makers have led the effort to explain that technological innovation is good for workers throughout the economy, even as its âcreative destructionâ causes dislocation for some. So why, suddenly, are they so eager to throw robots and programmers under the bus?â One answer might be that, given the current state of American political polarization, itâs either throw the robots under the bus or throw the immigrants. Cass, not surprisingly, advocates restricting immigration.\n\n-=-=-=\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) ran for President on a promise to create twenty-five million new jobs during the next decade. âMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before,â he said in September, 2016\\. Many economists mocked his plan, which included protecting American jobs by imposing tariffs on imports. _The Economist_ [announced](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/07/30/drawbridges-up) a new political fault line, not between left and right but between open and closed: âWelcome immigrants or keep them out? Open up to foreign trade or protect domestic industries? Embrace cultural change, or resist it?â [Barack Obama](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Barack%20Obama) was an opener. Openers tend to talk about robots. âThe next wave of economic dislocation wonât come from overseas,â Obama said in his farewell address, in January, 2017, days before Trumpâs Inauguration. âIt will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good, middle-class jobs obsolete.â\n\nTrump is a closer. Closers tend to talk about immigrants. Trump has tweeted the word âjobsâ nearly six hundred times, but not once has he tweeted the words ârobot,â ârobots,â or âautomation.â âWeâre going to fight for every last American job,â he promised from the floor of a Boeing plant in South Carolina, weeks after taking office. âI donât want companies leaving our country,â the new President said. âThere will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the products, and think that they are going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border.â That June, Boeing laid off nearly two hundred employees from the South Carolina plant, as part of a forty-per-cent reduction in its production of 777s. In 2017, the company laid off nearly six thousand workers.\n\nTrumpâs Administration mocks fears of a robot invasion. Closers usually do. âIâm not worried at all,â Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said two years ago. Nevertheless, some think tankers suggested that Trumpâs election was âsecretly about automation.â And [a study](https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-abstract/34/3/418/5047377) published last summer in the _Oxford Review of Economic Policy_âwhose lead author, Carl Frey, is the same guy who made the list of the seven hundred and two most computerizable jobsâargues that the robot caravan got Trump elected. Measuring the density of robots and comparing them with election returns, Frey and his colleagues found that âelectoral districts that became more exposed to automation during the years running up to the election were more likely to vote for Trump.â Indulging in a counterfactual, they suggest that a less steeply rising increase in exposure to robots would have tipped both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin toward voting for [Hillary Clinton](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/hillary-clinton). According to this line of thinking, Twitter bots and fake Facebook news didnât elect Donald Trump, but robots really might have. Or maybe it was all the talk about the wall.\n\nHeads, the robots are coming! Accept the inevitability of near-universal unemployment! Tails, the Mexicans are coming! Close the borders! So far, the only other choice, aside from helplessly watching the rise of extremism, is to mint a new coin. Heat a forge. Smelt a blank. Engrave two dies. Put your blank in between them. Strike the whole thing with a hammer. Anyone can do it.Â â¦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59112e62f8fa3e67faf0d229","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ffbc1c7a8e33fb390bc3","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jill Lepore, a staff writer, has been contributing toÂ *The New Yorker*Â since 2005.

Rouse studies the worms and other small animals that inhabit the deep sea. He was organizing his microscopes, dissection supplies, and jars of deep-sea critters when he received a long-anticipated e-mail. \n\nIn the late two-thousands, Rouse and Eddie Kisfaludy, then an operations manager for Virgin Oceanic, had begun meeting with officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (*NOAA*{: .small}) and the city of San Diego to pitch an alternative approach to the disposal of dead whales. Often, whales that wash up on shore are hauled to landfills or pushed back into the water. Rouse and Kisfaludy wanted to tow one out to sea, sink it to the seafloor, and watch what happened. Whale falls, as marine biologists call such events, create pop-up habitats that may serve as stepping stones for organisms migrating from methane seeps or hydrothermal vents to other parts of the ocean. Precisely how this works, and which species colonize the carcass as it degrades, were open questions that Rouse hoped to answer. \n\nIn the e-mail, a biologist from *NOAA*{: .small} wrote that a large female fin whale had washed ashore four days previously, on the rocky beach at Point Loma, just west of downtown San Diego. The *NOAA*{: .small} team had already moved the carcass to the protected beaches of Mission Bay and performed a necropsy, concluding that the whale had been hit by a ship. Now they were ready to hand it over to Rouse: if he could mobilize the necessary resources on short notice, the whale was his to sink.\n\nRouse quickly met up with Kisfaludy to strategize. They needed a boat big enough to tow a sixty-foot, twenty-three-ton whale, so Kisfaludy leaned on a Newport-based friend, Chris Welsh, for the use of his large catamaran. To sink the carcass, they sourced five tons of rusty chains from Newport Harbor  and another two tons of iron shackles from  the Scripps scrap yard, in San Diego.  \n\nOn Thanksgiving morning, Welsh set out in his catamaranârusty chains on boardâand sailed south.  The next day, he met up with Rouse, Kisfaludy, and a growing group of intrigued friends at the dead whale.  It rested on the sand, immovable. At high tide, however, the carcass began to float, and the team made its move. They tied seven ropes around the whaleâs tail and sailed west. Several hours passed. The weather was crisp and sunny, and there was little boat traffic. To Rouseâs surprise, the whale had attracted no scavengers, despite its exposed rolls of dark purple muscle draped in white, translucent fat. The team began to consider names for the whale. Someone suggested Rosebud, and it stuck.\n\nAt the drop zone, the team tied the ropes to the hunks of metal, then used the boatâs crane, normally used to launch submarines, to lower the weight into the water. After a few hours and a lot of splashing, all of it was deployedâbut Rosebud bobbed on the surface, refusing to sink. Rouse noticed a large gas bubble gathering inside the whaleâs throat. âWe were struggling with what to do,â he recalled, by phone. They wondered if they could release the trapped gas by  stabbing holes in the carcass, but, Rouse said, âall we had was a kitchen knife attached to a stick.â Kisfaludy and Welsh, dispatched on a dinghy, tried to free the gas, with no success. Then the afternoon breeze picked up. As the swell grew, the whale rocked back and forth. Eventually, the bubble popped out of its mouth, along with a pile of guts. The team cheered, delighted and disgusted. Rosebud disappeared beneath the waves.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nRosebud had sunk just twelve nautical miles from San Diego, but, in deep-sea research, close and accessible are very different things. The whale had fallen to a depth of eight hundred and fifty metresâabout half a mile. Most of the remotely operated vehicles, or R.O.V.s, capable of conducting  intricate operations at that depth are owned by oil companies; only a handful are available for scientific research. Such research expeditions can cost as much as fifty thousand dollars a day, and securing that much funding and ship time can take years. Rouseâs approach had been to sink Rosebud first and hope that scientists would find a way to visit it in the future. \n\nIn 2012, [Paul Allen](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-rare-humanism-behind-paul-allens-technological-vision)âs superyacht, Octopus, conducted some initial reconnaissance. In 2013, Rouse participated in an expedition mounted by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (*MBARI*{: .small}) to study animal and microbe dispersal patterns at Rosebud and other nearby habitats.  \n\nIn the middle of 2014, Rouse joined another *MBARI*{: .small} expedition. (In total, there have been five expeditions to Rosebud.) At the time, I was a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology, studying the microbial activity around methane seeps. Whale falls and methane seeps can support similar flavors of microbes; I jumped at the chance to come along.\n\nOn a breezy June morning, we set out aboard the Western Flyer, a boxy white ship run with the no-frills efficiency of a floating industrial platform. As we lurched out of San Diego, I frantically set up a shipboard lab, preparing chemicals and sampling jars. By the time we reached Rosebudâs location, the wind had risen and the seas had grown choppy. Belowdecks, the cresting waves reverberated between the twin hulls. Using a compact crane, engineers lowered the jeep-sized R.O.V. into the moon pool, an opening in the deck that offers entry into the water.\n\nI pinballed through the narrow corridor to the control center to watch the descent. As my eyes adjusted to the dark room, I saw that it was illuminated by a wall of about a dozen screens: one showed a tense World Cup match between Italy and Costa Rica, while the rest contained camera views from the R.O.V.âshades of blue fading to the black of the deep sea. Eventually, the R.O.V.âs lights illuminated a uniform brown plain punctuated by occasional red rockfish. The camera began to move across the seafloor toward Rosebud.\n\nWe knew, broadly, what had happened in the preceding three years. For denizens of the seafloor, a whale fall is like a Las Vegas buffetâan improbable bounty in the middle of the desert. Rosebud had delivered about a thousand yearsâ worth of food in one fell swoop. The first animals to pounce had been scavengers, such as sleeper sharks and slimy, snake-like hagfish. In the course of about six months, they had eaten most of the skin and muscle. Inevitably, the scavengers had scattered pieces of flesh around the whale carcass, and native microbes had multiplied quickly around those scraps. Their feeding frenzy, in turn, had depleted oxygen in the seafloorâs top layers, creating niches for microbes that could make methane or breathe sulfate. \n\nAs Rosebud came into view, we saw colorful microbial carpets light up the screensâplush white, yellow, and orange mats, each a community of microbes precisely tuned to their chemical milieu. The whaleâs towering rib cage had become a cathedral for worms, snails, and crabs, which grazed beneath its buttresses. A few hungry hagfish slithered through the skullâs eye sockets. When the cameras zoomed in, we saw that the bones were covered in red splotches. Rouse leapt from his chair and rushed to the monitors for a closer look: he suspected that the red tufts were colonies of remarkable bone-eating worms called *Osedax*, which had only just recently been described in a rigorous scientific study.\n\nSeveral hours later, the R.O.V. returned and was strapped to the deck. It had collected bone fragments, *Osedax* worms, and sediment cores. Kneeling next to a mud-draped robotic arm, I pushed rubber stoppers into tubes, then gingerly carried each sample to the lab, avoiding sudden movements to keep the sedimentary layers intact. The samples reeked of sulfur and decaying flesh. Staring down the eyepiece of a microscope, Rouse carefully extracted worms from bone fragments. Early the next morning, he was already back at it, tweezers in hand.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWhale falls may occur as frequently as every ten miles on the seafloor; at any given time, there are likely hundreds of thousands of them around the world. A 2015 review paper by the deep-sea ecologist Craig Smith, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and a number of collaborators proposed that decaying whale carcasses may serve âas a sort of biodiversity generator,â allowing organisms from different energy-rich seafloor oases, such as thermal vents or methane seeps, to mingle. The importance of these deep-sea ecosystems makes whale falls especially fascinating. Seafloor microbes consume methane, which is a greenhouse gas, and provide biomass that ultimately sustains fish populations. Rouseâs team is monitoring a number of habitats around Rosebud to understand how theyâre connected, and how deep-sea oases like whale falls and seeps might drive evolution.\n\nThere are creatures that have been observed at whale falls and nowhere else. *Osedax* are among them. Shana Goffredi, a biologist at Occidental College, was part of the team that first analyzed the *Osedax* worm in detail, at a whale fall in Monterey Canyon, around four hundred miles northwest of San Diego. Since then, she has led several research projects to piece together the wormâs genetic heritage and bizarre way of life. The first scavengers at a whale fall feast on the flesh. âAnything could take advantage of that,â Goffredi told me, dismissively. *Osedax*âLatin for âbone-eaterâââare specifically relying on bone, which is a weird, weird thing to eat.â\n\n*Osedax* are strange organisms. Their free-floating larvae latch onto a boneâs outer layers, sifting through the water for a specific type of bacteria, *Oceanospirillales,* which they cultivate inside their bodies. Like the tube worms that are found at hydrothermal vents, *Osedax* have no mouth and no gut; their symbiotic partners are essential to their survival. While still unclear, itâs thought that the enzymes made by the *Oceanospirillales* bacteria could degrade collagen and cholesterol inside the bone, providing nutrition for themselves as well as their host worms. Beyond *Osedax*, scientists are discovering more species found exclusively on whale carcasses. These include bacteria-grazing scale worms and bone-eating snailsâcreatures whose ingenious inter-organism partnerships equip them to extract energy from rock-hard bone.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/5c704b7c37f85a2b950d590d]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\nThe appearance of *Osedax* wasnât good news for Rosebudâs long-term prospects: âThey accelerate the degradation of the whale,â Goffredi said. âTheyâre essentially undermining their own substrateâmoving through it, acidifying itâand so they eat themselves out of a home. But it makes sense, since they have such an ephemeral existence. They live fast, die young. Theyâve just got to crank.â \n\nStill, in 2018, when I visited Rosebud for a second time, the skeleton was surprisingly intact. Around a dozen researchers were aboard the research vessel Falkor as a part of the Schmidt Ocean Instituteâs Backyard Deep expedition, which aimed to explore some of Southern Californiaâs chemically driven deep-sea ecosystems. This time, in addition to watching the video feed from the R.O.V., we awkwardly narrated the proceedings for a live-streaming audience. When Rosebudâs hulking eye sockets came into view, I was relieved to find her reclining, stalwart, right where weâd left her. But, like a distant friend, she had changed. The dead-eyed hagfish were gone; so were the vibrant orange and yellow microbial mats. Only a thin white dusting remainedâa reminder of the good times.\n\nOn Rosebudâs bones, *Osedax* and other segmented worms crawled lethargically, their slimy residue forming black, crisscrossing tubes. The R.O.V.âs pilots used its robotic arms to collect a vertebral disk; later, in the Falkorâs lab, members of Rouseâs team picked critters from the bones while the lights of San Diego shone in the distance.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nHow long can a whale fall endure before it disappears? Eventually, creatures like *Osedax* will destroy most of the skeleton. In a process called sedimentation, particles sinking through the water will bury anything that remains. While studying whale falls in Monterey Canyon, Rouse and his colleagues expected that the oasis around a typical carcass might persist for a couple of decades, but Rouse also came to believe that some could disappear over a much shorter or longer period of time. He thinks that a lower rate of sedimentation in Rosebudâs particular patch of seafloor, coupled with a seemingly sluggish excavation by *Osedax*, might mean that it could take half a century or more before all traces of Rosebud fade.\n\nCurrently, there are no specific plans to visit Rosebud, but Rouse is confident that something will materialize. (Many biologists are keen to make the trip.) In the meantime, when they were last seen, Rosebudâs vertebrae formed sharp promontories above the seafloor. Though only a few feet tall, theyâre likely the highest points for miles around. Fluffy pink anemones swayed at their peaks, presaging the whaleâs future as a reefâa place where animals and corals can bathe in the currents, catching food as it drifts through. \n\n*Danyoung Kim contributed reporting to this post.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d9aee7fe02cbd163441","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Marine Biology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"marine-biology"},{"id":"5c2e1cde22d4972cd5b83306","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Whales","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"whales"},{"id":"5c2e1c7836cecf40192141c5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"Science","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5c66eda06840e27aad335674","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"Jeffrey Marlow","socialMedia":[],"title":"Jeffrey Marlow is a geobiologist at Harvard University, where he studies complex microbial communities in extreme environments.

It quickly became apparent that he knew less about the subject than I did; he saved Facebook posts by painstakingly copying and pasting them into Word, comment by comment, and manually pressing print. The longer we spoke, the more visibly annoyed he grew by my questions, to which he offered no answers. He leaned farther and farther back in his chair and gazed over my left shoulder. Finally, he launched into a story about his senior year of college, when he wrote his thesis on an ill-defined topic and slowly realized that heâd bitten off more than he could chew. At first, I nodded politely, not understanding how this related to anything. Then the intent of the anecdote flooded through me on a tide of adrenaline, and I moved my notepad to my lap so that he couldnât see my hand shaking with rage.\n\nOutside of the library, I stood in the cold and waited for my heart rate to return to normal. I wondered if the archivist was right that I was a naÃ¯ve girl with inchoate ideas. Then I asked myself what gave him the power to make me wonder. Until then, Iâd endured male condescension as if it couldnât touch me, observing my small humiliations, across years in the workplace, from the other side of a cool pane of glass. But the barrage of #MeToo stories had stirred the sediment from those experiences, revealing that my self-regard had always been porous. The meeting with the archivist was barely a #MeToo momentâit was not sexual assault or harassment but rather a familiar kind of gendered belittlement. Still, it was the moment when #MeToo fully reached me.\n\nWhen I consider why I feel compelled to publish this storyâso small, and so many months after the factâI arrive at the answer that I want to contribute, however meagrely, to the record of what it was like to live through that fall. The notion that the memory of #MeToo needs preservingâboth because it matters and because it could disappearâis also the premise of a much larger archival effort. In June, the Schlesinger Library at Harvard Universityâs Radcliffe Institute, arguably the paramount repository of works on American feminism, announced its intention to collect the millions of tweets and hundreds of thousands of Web pagesânews articles, legislation, changing H.R. policies, public apologiesâthat composed #MeToo and remain as its evidence. (Harvard faculty members of the steering committee for the #MeToo project include [Jill Lepore](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jill-lepore), a staff writer for this magazine, and [Jeannie Suk Gersen](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jeannie-suk), a contributing writer.)\n\nThe undertaking has few major precedents. Only in the past decade have historians recognized the value of social media and libraries [begun building tools to collect it at scale](https://harpers.org/archive/2018/12/preservation-acts-archiving-twitter-social-media-movements/). (For seven years, starting in 2010, the Library of Congress vacuumed up every tweet, but that archive remains closed to researchers.) The Schlesinger has had to locate its own answers to a battery of technical and ethical questions as it prepares to allow access to its holdings, at least in part, by late 2019\\. For example, many of the women and men who shared #MeToo stories may have thought of them as ephemeral; they didnât anticipate that they could become fodder for future theories of history. Itâs a thorny dilemma but one that the library has no hope of solving if it doesnât gather the posts before they disappear. âThe argument is always in favor of preservation and against loss,â Jane Kamensky, the Schlesinger director and a Harvard history professor, told me. âAs a historian, I believe we only understand things through primary evidence. Anything that stays dark is not going to be understood.â\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nI met with Kamensky and her team in January, in temporary offices a few blocks from the Radcliffe Quadrangle (where the library is undergoing renovation), for [a virtual tour of what theyâve collected so far](https://www.schlesinger-metooproject-radcliffe.org/). She said that she hopes the data will go some way toward answering essential questions about #MeToo: What, if anything, has it accomplished? Was #MeToo a burst of revolutionary energy that has since flamed out, or is it a still-growing constellation of attempts to organize? Amanda Strauss, the special projects manager at the Schlesinger, said that their Twitter searches for #MeToo and related hashtags have continued to yield around a hundred and fifty thousand tweets every week, leaving them unsure about when to impose a temporal boundary on the archiveâor where, in hindsight, historians will locate the end of #MeToo.\n\nThe archivists use a tool, created at George Washington University and called [Social Feed Manager](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/about/overview), to perform weekly downloads of roughly fifty hashtags, which capture both trending conversations (#MuteRKelly) and sector-specific ones (#MeTooMedicine, #TimesUpTech), and also the parallel universe of counter-denunciations that collect under banners like #MeTooLiars and #IStandWithBrett. On the day of my visit, they scrolled through the latest haul of tweets from the evangelical #[ChurchToo](https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/silence-is-not-spiritual-the-evangelical-metoo-movement) movement to demonstrate how the app creates spreadsheets of the postsâ metadata (information such as the number of retweets, the number of followers, and geolocation, if user-enabled). Twitterâs A.P.I. permits this kind of free mass download for the first week or so after a post appears on the Web, and the library is working with the company to purchase the nearly nineteen million tweets from the first year of the hashtagsâ use.\n\nOther social-media sites present greater challenges: the Schlesinger can crawl individual Facebook and Instagram pages with a tool called the [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.io/), but collecting them at scale is notoriously difficult. (Strauss told me that the issue of archiving these platforms more extensively is temporarily âon hold.â) The staff had planned to choose news articles and other URLs by hand before realizing that they needed to rethink their reach. Now theyâre using [Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org/), a tool developed by faculty members at M.I.T. and Harvard, to run vast searches of news stories that they can archive en masse.\n\nAs Jill Lepore has [written in *The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb), most people assume that the Webâs contents will be with us forever. (âDonât post that picture if you donât want it to follow you!â) In fact, the Internet is among our most ephemeral inventions: a piece of paper can survive for seven hundred years, but âthe average life of a Web page is about a hundred days,â she wrote. To Strauss, collecting #MeToo feels âlike weâre in the middle of a ticker-tape parade, and this content is raining down around us, and we need to pick it up or itâs going to get swept up and put in the trash.â So far, the vulnerable sites shored up on Harvardâs servers include a Medium [post about sexual harassment in the childrenâs-book industry](https://medium.com/@anneursu_10179/sexual-harassment-in-the-childrens-book-industry-3417048ccde2), a whisper-network-sourced [accounting of abuses in *STEM*{:.small}](https://metoostem.com/stories/), and a hyper-local news serviceâs [investigation of the California state legislature](https://calmatters.org/articles/blog/track-the-legislatures-sexual-harassment-records-with-our-spreadsheet/). Ultimately, the collection will reach back to 2006, when the activist Tarana Burke began campaigning against sexual assault using the slogan âme too.â\n\nThe Schlesinger staffâs choices shape the archive to a degree thatâs unusual, and a little unwelcome. Standard collections have implicit boundaries: theyâre the papers of a person or an organization or perhaps the surviving documentation of a single event, such as the March for Life. But #MeTooâwhich drew strength from millions of sources and exerted influence in every directionâcan only be captured in what archivists call a âconstructedâ or âartificialâ collection, an assemblage of objects of disparate provenance, with borders that are imposed, not absolute. The Schlesinger has other constructed collections, such as a survey of early womenâs blogs, but the #MeToo project is by far the most ambitious. It pushes the library to the edge of its traditional role in a field that draws a stark line between archivists, who leave as few fingerprints as possible, and scholars, who mold history from the assembled clay.\n\nâItâs not the job of the archivist or librarian to try to answer questions like âIs #MeToo a movement?â or impose our own conceptual framework on this material,â Jane Kelly, the Web-archiving assistant who harvests the bulk of the actual posts and pages, said. âMy interpretation is a moot point.â But in this case the collectors canât help but be curators, judging where #MeToo ends and where every other discussion of women, work, harassment, and violence begins.\n\nSome Internet preservationists have been pushing brick-and-mortar libraries to embrace this evolution. âTraditional archivists seem most comfortable dealing with the outcomes of the work of various types of documenters,â Clifford Lynch, the director of the Coalition for Networked Information, [wrote in an influential 2017 paper](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/8097/6583). But the Internet is more like âa nearly infinite number of unique, individual, personalized performancesââa new one every time you log onâthan it is an assortment of artifacts. Lynch warns, âIf archivists will not *create, capture, curate* the âAge of Algorithms,â then we must quickly figure out who will undertake this task.â\n\nThe #MeToo project is one step in this direction, and itâs fitting that it occurs in the service of feminist history. Feminismâs contributions include a heightened awareness of history as a construct, its shape determined by what it leaves out. In [her famous poem](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/diving-wreck) âDiving Into the Wreck,â Adrienne Rich, whose papers the Schlesinger holds, envisions the legacy of womenâs lives as a hulk left to decay beneath the surface of the official past. She imagines herself swimming down âto see the damage that was done / and the treasures that prevail&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;the wreck and not the story of the wreck.â Survivors used #MeToo to dredge their experiences for inclusion in history. The archive of their efforts will tacitly acknowledge, by way of its construction, that no record is ever objective or complete.\n\n-=-=-=-\nAnother theme of feminist scholarship, and of #MeToo, is womenâs agency: telling your own story on your own terms. In the archive, this principle competes with the belief that the stories are worth saving. Itâs impossible to ask the individuals behind millions of Twitter accounts for permission to preserve their words, and, legally speaking, itâs also unnecessary under the companyâs user agreement. Twitter says that account holders own their tweets, but the fine print reveals that they donât control them: in [a recent survey](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305118763366) of two hundred and sixty-eight Twitter users, almost half were under the mistaken impression that their tweets couldnât be gathered for research without their express consent.\n\nAt the Schlesinger, these concerns are shaping conversations about which parts of the archive will be accessible to researchers, and when. The library could choose to share Twitter data from verified accounts, or accounts that reach a certain threshold number of followers, under the assumption that they had little expectation of privacy. In theory, it could allow keyword searches in which a researcher âasks the data a question and gets back an answer,â Kelly said, even as the actual tweets remain out of sight. The library quite possibly *would* remove content from view of the researchersâthough not from the collectionâif petitioned by its author. And the staff has considered the possibility that parts of the collection could be requested in the course of ongoing #MeToo litigation.  \n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nUltimately, the archivists view their work as a service to researchers far removed from these skirmishes. âTime solves the problem as long as the material is collected and maintained,â Kamensky told me. âOur horizon is very long, so if something needs to be closed for the life of the author, it can be.â Harvard, in accordance with federal law, embargoes student records for eighty years, for example. âI often shock students by telling them thatâs an actuarial assumption about when theyâll be dead.â And while collections often place restrictions on access in consultation with donors, the archivists hope to make most of the material accessible as soon as possible.\n\nStill, it may take a long time to discern what #MeToo meant, a question that waits to be answered by what happens next. For me, the collection is a comfort, preserving the futureâs ability to know what we donâtâto examine in daylight our record of travelling the undersea deep. I wish that I could see the present through the eyes of that someday, or even that I knew what I would do if I met that male archivist who belittled me now. Would I tell him that Iâm good at my job, which he doesnât seem to beâor would his condescension still have a hold on me? Would I even get angry, or would I just keep abjectly nodding, observing the insult from my old, practiced remove? If youâre reading this in the future (unlikely, but anyway), I wonder: Does my story make sense to you? I suspect it may sound familiar, but I hope

Not much more than three hours later, the plane, a Boeing 777, crashed in a field outside Donetsk, Ukraine. All two hundred and ninety-eight people on board were killed. The planeâs last radio contact was at 1:20 *P.M.*{: .small} G.M.T. At 2:50 *P.M.*{: .small} G.M.T., Igor Girkin, a Ukrainian separatist leader also known as Strelkov, or someone acting on his behalf, posted a message on VKontakte, a Russian social-media site: âWe just downed a plane, an AN-26.â (An Antonov 26 is a Soviet-built military cargo plane.) The post includes links to video of the wreckage of a plane; it appears to be a Boeing 777.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks before the crash, Anatol Shmelev, the curator of the Russia and Eurasia collection at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford, had submitted to the Internet Archive, a nonprofit library in California, a list of Ukrainian and Russian Web sites and blogs that ought to be recorded as part of the archiveâs Ukraine Conflict collection. Shmelev is one of about a thousand librarians and archivists around the world who identify possible acquisitions for the Internet Archiveâs subject collections, which are stored in its Wayback Machine, in San Francisco. Strelkovâs VKontakte page was on Shmelevâs list. âStrelkov is the field commander in Slaviansk and one of the most important figures in the conflict,â Shmelev had written in an e-mail to the Internet Archive on July 1st, and his page âdeserves to be recorded twice a day.â\n\n\n\nOn July 17th, at 3:22 *P.M.*{: .small} G.M.T., the Wayback Machine saved a screenshot of Strelkovâs VKontakte post about downing a plane. Two hours and twenty-two minutes later, Arthur Bright, the Europe editor of the _Christian Science Monitor_, tweeted a picture of the screenshot, along with the message âGrab of Donetsk militant Strelkovâs claim of downing what appears to have been MH17.â By then, Strelkovâs VKontakte page had already been edited: the claim about shooting down a plane was deleted. The only real evidence of the original claim lies in the Wayback Machine.\n\n\n\nThe average life of a Web page is about a hundred days. Strelkovâs âWe just downed a planeâ post lasted barely two hours. It might seem, and it often feels, as though stuff on the Web lasts forever, for better and frequently for worse: the embarrassing photograph, the regretted blog (more usually regrettable not in the way the slaughter of civilians is regrettable but in the way that bad hair is regrettable). No one believes any longer, if anyone ever did, that âif itâs on the Web it must be true,â but a lot of people do believe that if itâs on the Web it will stay on the Web. Chances are, though, that it actually wonât. In 2006, David Cameron gave a speech in which he said that Google was democratizing the world, because âmaking more information available to more peopleâ was providing âthe power for anyone to hold to account those who in the past might have had a monopoly of power.â Seven years later, Britainâs Conservative Party scrubbed from its Web site ten yearsâ worth of Tory speeches, including that one. Last year, BuzzFeed deleted more than four thousand of its staff writersâ early posts, apparently because, as time passed, they looked stupider and stupider. Social media, public records, junk: in the end, everything goes.\n\n\n\nWeb pages donât have to be deliberately deleted to disappear. Sites hosted by corporations tend to die with their hosts. When MySpace, GeoCities, and Friendster were reconfigured or sold, millions of accounts vanished. (Some of those companies may have notified users, but Jason Scott, who started an outfit called Archive Teamâits motto is âWe are going to rescue your shitââsays that such notification is usually purely notional: âThey were sending e-mail to dead e-mail addresses, saying, âHello, Arthur Dent, your house is going to be crushed.âÂ â) Facebook has been around for only a decade; it wonât be around forever. Twitter is a rare case: it has arranged to archive all of its tweets at the Library of Congress. In 2010, after the announcement, Andy Borowitz tweeted, âLibrary of Congress to acquire entire Twitter archiveâwill rename itself Museum of Crap.â Not long after that, Borowitz abandoned that Twitter account. You might, one day, be able to find his old tweets at the Library of Congress, but not anytime soon: the Twitter Archive is not yet open for research. Meanwhile, on the Web, if you click on a link to Borowitzâs tweet about the Museum of Crap, you get this message: âSorry, that page doesnât exist!â\n\n\n\nThe Web dwells in a never-ending present. It isâelementallyâethereal, ephemeral, unstable, and unreliable. Sometimes when you try to visit a Web page what you see is an error message: âPage Not Found.â This is known as âlink rot,â and itâs a drag, but itâs better than the alternative. More often, you see an updated Web page; most likely the original has been overwritten. (To overwrite, in computing, means to destroy old data by storing new data in their place; overwriting is an artifact of an era when computer storage was very expensive.) Or maybe the page has been moved and something else is where it used to be. This is known as âcontent drift,â and itâs more pernicious than an error message, because itâs impossible to tell that what youâre seeing isnât what you went to look for: the overwriting, erasure, or moving of the original is invisible. For the law and for the courts, link rot and content drift, which are collectively known as âreference rot,â have been disastrous. In providing evidence, legal scholars, lawyers, and judges often cite Web pages in their footnotes; they expect that evidence to remain where they found it as their proof, the way that evidence on paperâin court records and books and law journalsâremains where they found it, in libraries and courthouses. But a 2013 survey of law- and policy-related publications found that, at the end of six years, nearly fifty per cent of the URLs cited in those publications no longer worked. According to a 2014 study conducted at Harvard Law School, âmore than 70% of the URLs within the Harvard Law Review and other journals, and 50% of the URLs within United States Supreme Court opinions, do not link to the originally cited information.â The overwriting, drifting, and rotting of the Web is no less catastrophic for engineers, scientists, and doctors. Last month, a team of digital library researchers based at Los Alamos National Laboratory reported the results of an exacting study of three and a half million scholarly articles published in science, technology, and medical journals between 1997 and 2012: one in five links provided in the notes suffers from reference rot. Itâs like trying to stand on quicksand.\n\n\n\nThe footnote, a landmark in the history of civilization, took centuries to invent and to spread. It has taken mere years nearly to destroy. A footnote used to say, âHere is how I know this and where I found it.â A footnote thatâs a link says, âHere is what I used to know and where I once found it, but chances are itâs not there anymore.â It doesnât matter whether footnotes are your stock-in-trade. Everybodyâs in a pinch. Citing a Web page as the source for something you knowâusing a URL as evidenceâis ubiquitous. Many people find themselves doing it three or four times before breakfast and five times more before lunch. What happens when your evidence vanishes by dinnertime?\n\n\n\nThe day after Strelkovâs âWe just downed a planeâ post was deposited into the Wayback Machine, Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told the U.N. Security Council, in New York, that Ukrainian separatist leaders had âboasted on social media about shooting down a plane, but later deleted these messages.â In San Francisco, the people who run the Wayback Machine posted on the Internet Archiveâs Facebook page, âHereâs why we exist.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe address of the Internet Archive is archive.org, but another way to visit is to take a plane to San Francisco and ride in a cab to the Presidio, past cypresses that look as though someone had drawn them there with a smudgy crayon. At 300 Funston Avenue, climb a set of stone steps and knock on the brass door of a Greek Revival temple. You canât miss it: itâs painted wedding-cake white and itâs got, out front, eight Corinthian columns and six marble urns.\n\n\n\n\n\nâWe bought it because it matched our logo,â Brewster Kahle told me when I met him there, and he wasnât kidding. Kahle is the founder of the Internet Archive and the inventor of the Wayback Machine. The logo of the Internet Archive is a white, pedimented Greek temple. When Kahle started the Internet Archive, in 1996, in his attic, he gave everyone working with him a book called âThe Vanished Library,â about the burning of the Library of Alexandria. âThe idea is to build the Library of Alexandria Two,â he told me. (The Hellenism goes further: thereâs a partial backup of the Internet Archive in Alexandria, Egypt.) Kahleâs plan is to one-up the Greeks. The motto of the Internet Archive is âUniversal Access to All Knowledge.â The Library of Alexandria was open only to the learned; the Internet Archive is open to everyone. In 2009, when the Fourth Church of Christ, Scientist, decided to sell its building, Kahle went to Funston Avenue to see it, and said, âThatâs our logo!â He loves that the churchâs cornerstone was laid in 1923: everything published in the United States before that date lies in the public domain. A temple built in copyrightâs year zero seemed fated. Kahle hops, just slightly, in his shoes when he gets excited. He says, showing me the church, âItâs _Greek!_â\n\n\n\nKahle is long-armed and pink-cheeked and public-spirited; his hair is gray and frizzled. He wears round wire-rimmed eyeglasses, linen pants, and patterned button-down shirts. He looks like Mr. Micawber, if Mr. Micawber had left Dickensâs London in a time machine and landed in the Pacific, circa 1955, disguised as an American tourist. Instead, Kahle was born in New Jersey in 1960. When he was a kid, he watched âThe Rocky and Bullwinkle Showâ; it has a segment called âPeabodyâs Improbable History,â which is where the Wayback Machine got its name. Mr. Peabody, a beagle who is also a Harvard graduate and a Nobel laureate, builds a *WABAC*{: .small} machineâitâs meant to sound like a *UNIVAC*{: .small}, one of the first commercial computersâand he uses it to take a boy named Sherman on adventures in time. âWe just set it, turn it on, open the door, and there we areâor _were_, really,â Peabody says.\n\n\n\nWhen Kahle was growing up, some of the very same people who were building what would one day become the Internet were thinking about libraries. In 1961, in Cambridge, J. C. R. Licklider, a scientist at the technology firm Bolt, Beranek and Newman, began a two-year study on the future of the library, funded by the Ford Foundation and aided by a team of researchers that included Marvin Minsky, at M.I.T. As Licklider saw it, books were good at displaying information but bad at storing, organizing, and retrieving it. âWe should be prepared to reject the schema of the physical book itself,â he argued, and to reject âthe printed page as a long-term storage device.â The goal of the project was to imagine what libraries would be like in the year 2000. Licklider envisioned a library in which computers would replace books and form a ânetwork in which every element of the fund of knowledge is connected to every other element.â \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b5f1120855957e69d53f1]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nIn 1963, Licklider became a director at the Department of Defenseâs Advanced Research Projects Agency (now called *DARPA*{: .small}). During his first year, he wrote a seven-page memo in which he addressed his colleagues as âMembers and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network,â and proposed the networking of *ARPA*{: .small} machines. This sparked the imagination of an electrical engineer named Lawrence Roberts, who later went to *ARPA*{: .small} from M.I.T.âs Lincoln Laboratory. (Licklider had helped found both B.B.N. and Lincoln.) Lickliderâs two-hundred-page Ford Foundation report, âLibraries of the Future,â was published in 1965. By then, the network he imagined was already being built, and the word âhyper-textâ was being used. By 1969, relying on a data-transmission technology called âpacket-switchingâ which had been developed by a Welsh scientist named Donald Davies, *ARPA*{: .small} had built a computer network called *ARPAnet*{: .small}. By the mid-nineteen-seventies, researchers across the country had developed a network of networks: an internetwork, or, later, an âinternet.â\n\n\n\nKahle enrolled at M.I.T. in 1978. He studied computer science and engineering with Minsky. After graduating, in 1982, he worked for and started companies that were later sold for a great deal of money. In the late eighties, while working at Thinking Machines, he developed Wide Area Information Servers, or *WAIS*{: .small}, a protocol for searching, navigating, and publishing on the Internet. One feature of *WAIS*{: .small} was a time axis; it provided for archiving through version control. (Wikipedia has version control; from any page, you can click on a tab that says âView Historyâ to see all earlier versions of that page.) *WAIS*{: .small} came before the Web, and was then overtaken by it. In 1989, at *CERN*{: .small}, the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee, an English computer scientist, proposed a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) to link pages on what he called the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee toyed with the idea of a time axis for his protocol, too. One reason it was never developed was the preference for the most up-to-date information: a bias against obsolescence. But the chief reason was the premium placed on ease of use. âWe were so young then, and the Web was so young,â Berners-Lee told me. âI was trying to get it to go. Preservation was not a priority. But weâre getting older now.â Other scientists involved in building the infrastructure of the Internet are getting older and more concerned, too. Vint Cerf, who worked on *ARPAnet*{: .small} in the seventies, and now holds the title of Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, has started talking about what he sees as a need for âdigital vellumâ: long-term storage. âI worry that the twenty-first century will become an informational black hole,â Cerf e-mailed me. But Kahle has been worried about this problem all along.\n\n\n\nâIâm completely in praise of what Tim Berners-Lee did,â Kahle told me, âbut he kept it very, very simple.â The first Web page in the United States was created at *SLAC*{: .small}, Stanfordâs linear-accelerator center, at the end of 1991. Berners-Leeâs protocolâwhich is not only usable but also elegantâspread fast, initially across universities and then into the public. âEmphasized text like *this*{: .blue} is a hypertext link,â a 1994 version of *SLAC*{: .small}âs Web page explained. In 1991, a ban on commercial traffic on the Internet was lifted. Then came Web browsers and e-commerce: both Netscape and Amazon were founded in 1994. The Internet as most people now know itâWeb-based and commercialâbegan in the mid-nineties. Just as soon as it began, it started disappearing.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAnd the Internet Archive began collecting it. The Wayback Machine is a Web archive, a collection of old Web pages; it is, in fact, _the_ Web archive. There are others, but the Wayback Machine is so much bigger than all of them that itâs very nearly true that if itâs not in the Wayback Machine it doesnât exist. The Wayback Machine is a robot. It crawls across the Internet, in the manner of Eric Carleâs very hungry caterpillar, attempting to make a copy of every Web page it can find every two months, though that rate varies. (It first crawled over this magazineâs home page, newyorker.com, in November, 1998, and since then has crawled the site nearly seven thousand times, lately at a rate of about six times a day.) The Internet Archive is also stocked with Web pages that are chosen by librarians, specialists like Anatol Shmelev, collecting in subject areas, through a service called Archive It, at archive-it.org, which also allows individuals and institutions to build their own archives. (A copy of everything they save goes into the Wayback Machine, too.) And anyone who wants to can preserve a Web page, at any time, by going to archive.org/web, typing in a URL, and clicking âSave Page Now.â (Thatâs how most of the twelve screenshots of Strelkovâs VKontakte page entered the Wayback Machine on the day the Malaysia Airlines flight was downed: seven captures that day were made by a robot; the rest were made by humans.)\n\n\n\n\n\nI was on a panel with Kahle a few years ago, discussing the relationship between material and digital archives. When I met him, I was struck by a story he told about how he once put the entire World Wide Web into a shipping container. He just wanted to see if it would fit. How big is the Web? It turns out, he said, that itâs twenty feet by eight feet by eight feet, or, at least, it was on the day he measured it. How much did it weigh? Twenty-six thousand pounds. He thought that _meant_ something. He thought people needed to _know_ that.\n\n\n\nKahle put the Web into a storage container, but most people measure digital data in bytes. This essay is about two hundred thousand bytes. A book is about a megabyte. A megabyte is a million bytes. A gigabyte is a billion bytes. A terabyte is a million million bytes. A petabyte is a million gigabytes. In the lobby of the Internet Archive, you can get a free bumper sticker that says â10,000,000,000,000,000 Bytes Archived.â Ten petabytes. Itâs obsolete. That figure is from 2012. Since then, itâs doubled.\n\n\n\nThe Wayback Machine has archived more than four hundred and thirty billion Web pages. The Web is global, but, aside from the Internet Archive, a handful of fledgling commercial enterprises, and a growing number of university Web archives, most Web archives are run by national libraries. They collect chiefly whatâs in their own domains (the Web Archive of the National Library of Sweden, for instance, includes every Web page that ends in â.seâ). The Library of Congress has archived nine billion pages, the British Library six billion. Those collections, like the collections of most national libraries, are in one way or another dependent on the Wayback Machine; the majority also use Heritrix, the Internet Archiveâs open-source code. The British Library and the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale de France backfilled the early years of their collections by using the Internet Archiveâs crawls of the .uk and .fr domains. The Library of Congress doesnât actually do its own Web crawling; it contracts with the Internet Archive to do it instead.\n\n\n\nThe church at 300 Funston Avenue is twenty thousand square feet. The Internet Archive, the building, is open to the public most afternoons. It is, after all, a library. In addition to housing the Wayback Machine, the Internet Archive is a digital library, a vast collection of digitized books, films, television and radio programs, music, and other stuff. Because of copyright, not everything the Internet Archive has digitized is online. In the lobby of the church, thereâs a scanning station and a listening room: two armchairs, a coffee table, a pair of bookshelves, two iPads, and two sets of headphones. âYou can listen to anything here,â Kahle says. âWe canât put all our music on the Internet, but we can put everything here.â\n\n\n\nCopyright is the elephant in the archive. One reason the Library of Congress has a very small Web-page collection, compared with the Internet Archive, is that the Library of Congress generally does not collect a Web page without asking, or, at least, giving notice. âThe Internet Archive hoovers,â Abbie Grotke, who runs the Library of Congressâs Web-archive team, says. âWe canât hoover, because we have to notify site owners and get permissions.â (There are some exceptions.) The Library of Congress has something like an opt-in policy; the Internet Archive has an opt-out policy. The Wayback Machine collects every Web page it can find, unless that page is blocked; blocking a Web crawler requires adding only a simple text file, ârobots.txt,â to the root of a Web site. The Wayback Machine will honor that file and not crawl that site, and it will also, when it comes across a robots.txt, remove all past versions of that site. When the Conservative Party in Britain deleted ten yearsâ worth of speeches from its Web site, it also added a robots.txt, which meant that, the next time the Wayback Machine tried to crawl the site, all its captures of those speeches went away, too. (Some have since been restored.) In a story that ran in the _Guardian_, a Labour Party M.P. said, âIt will take more than David Cameron pressing delete to make people forget about his broken promises.â And it would take more than a robots.txt to entirely destroy those speeches: they have also been collected in the U.K. Web Archive, at the British Library. The U.K. has whatâs known as a legal-deposit law; it requires copies of everything published in Britain to be deposited in the British Library. In 2013, that law was revised to include everything published on the U.K. Web. âPeople put their private lives up there, and we actually donât want that stuff,â Andy Jackson, the technical head of the U.K. Web Archive, told me. âWe donât want anything that you wouldnât consider a publication.â It is hard to say quite where the line lies. But Britainâs legal-deposit laws mean that the British Library doesnât have to honor a request to stop collecting.\n\n\n\nLegal-deposit laws have been the standard in Western Europe for centuries. They provide national libraries with a form of legal protection unavailable to the Library of Congress, which is not strictly a national library; also, U.S. legal- deposit laws have exempted online-only works. âWe are citadels,â Gildas Illien, the former Web archivist at the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale de France, told me. The Internet Archive is an invaluable public institution, but itâs not a national library, either, and, because the law of copyright has not kept up with technological change, Kahle has been collecting Web sites and making them freely available to the public without the full and explicit protection of the law. âItâs extremely audacious,â Illien says. âIn Europe, no organization, or very few, would take that risk.â Thereâs another feature to legal-deposit laws like those in France, a compromise between advocates of archiving and advocates of privacy. Archivists at the BnF can capture whatever Web pages they want, but those collections can be used only in the physical building itself. (For the same reason, you canât check a book out of the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale de France; you have to read it there.) One result is that the BnFâs Web archive is used by a handful of researchers, a few dozen a month; the Wayback Machine is used by hundreds of thousands of people a day.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, Kahle proposed an initiative in which the Internet Archive, in collaboration with national libraries, would become the head of a worldwide consortium of Web archives. (The Internet Archive collects from around the world, and is available in most of the world. Currently, the biggest exception is ChinaââI guess because we have materials on the archive that the Chinese government would rather not have its citizens see,â Kahle says.) This plan didnât work out, but from that failure came the International Internet Preservation Consortium, founded in 2003 and chartered at the BnF. It started with a dozen member institutions; there are now forty-nine.\n\n\n\nSomething else came out of that consortium. I talked to Illien two days after the massacre in Paris at the offices of _Charlie Hebdo_. âWe are overwhelmed, and scared, and even taking the subway is terrifying, and we are scared for our children,â Illien said. âThe library is a target.â When we spoke, the suspects were still at large; hostages had been taken. Illien and his colleagues had started a Web archive about the massacre and the worldâs response. âRight now the media is full of it, but we know that most of that wonât last,â he said. âWe wrote to our colleagues around the world and asked them to send us feeds to these URLs, to Web sites that were happening, right now, in Paris, so that we could collect them and historians will one day be able to see.â He was very quiet. He said, âWhen something like that happens, you wonder what you can do from where you sit. Our job is memory.â \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b5f13ba20a654ac5d4462]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nThe plan to found a global Internet archive proved unworkable, partly because national laws relating to legal deposit, copyright, and privacy are impossible to reconcile, but also because Europeans tend to be suspicious of American organizations based in Silicon Valley ingesting their cultural inheritance. Illien told me that, when faced with Kahleâs proposal, ânational libraries decided they could not rely on a third party,â even a nonprofit, âfor such a fundamental heritage and preservation mission.â In this same spirit, and in response to Google Books, European libraries and museums collaborated to launch Europeana, a digital library, in 2008. The Googleplex, Googleâs headquarters, is thirty-eight miles away from the Internet Archive, but the two could hardly be more different. In 2009, after the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers sued Google Books for copyright infringement, Kahle opposed the proposed settlement, charging Google with effectively attempting to privatize the public-library system. In 2010, he was on the founding steering committee of the Digital Public Library of America, which is something of an American version of Europeana; its mission is to make whatâs in libraries, archives, and museums âfreely available to the worldÂ .Â .Â . in the face of increasingly restrictive digital options.â\n\n\n\nKahle is a digital utopian attempting to stave off a digital dystopia. He views the Web as a giant library, and doesnât think it ought to belong to a corporation, or that anyone should have to go through a portal owned by a corporation in order to read it. âWe are building a library that is us,â he says, âand it is ours.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWhen the Internet Archive bought the church, Kahle recalls, âwe had the idea that weâd convert it into a library, but what does a library look like anymore? So weâve been settling in, and figuring that out.â\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the lobby, we headed up a flight of yellow-carpeted stairs to the chapel, an enormous dome-ceilinged room filled with rows of oak pews. There are arched stained-glass windows, and the dome is a stained-glass window, too, open to the sky, like an eye of God. The chapel seats seven hundred people. The floor is sloped. âAt first, we thought weâd flatten the floor and pull up the pews,â Kahle said, as he gestured around the room. âBut we couldnât. Theyâre just too beautiful.â\n\n\n\nOn the wall on either side of the altar, wooden slates display what, when this was a church, had been the listing of the dayâs hymn numbers. The archivists of the Internet have changed those numbers. One hymn number was 314. âDo you know what that is?â Kahle asked. It was a test, and something of a trick question, like when someone asks you whatâs your favorite B track on the White Album. âPi,â I said, dutifully, or its first three digits, anyway. Another number was 42. Kahle gave me an inquiring look. I rolled my eyes. Seriously? But it is serious, in a way. Itâs hard not to worry that the Wayback Machine will end up like the computer in Douglas Adamsâs âHitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy,â which is asked what is the meaning of âlife, the universe, and everything,â and, after thinking for millions of years, says, âForty-two.â If the Internet can be archived, will it ever have anything to tell us? Honestly, isnât most of the Web trash? And, if everythingâs saved, wonât there be too much of it for anyone to make sense of any of it? Wonât it be useless?\n\n\n\nThe Wayback Machine is humongous, and getting humongouser. You canât search it the way you can search the Web, because itâs too big and whatâs in there isnât sorted, or indexed, or catalogued in any of the many ways in which a paper archive is organized; itâs not ordered in any way at all, except by URL and by date. To use it, all you can do is type in a URL, and choose the date for it that youâd like to look at. Itâs more like a phone book than like an archive. Also, itâs riddled with errors. One kind is created when the dead Web grabs content from the live Web, sometimes because Web archives often crawl different parts of the same page at different times: text in one year, photographs in another. In October, 2012, if you asked the Wayback Machine to show you what cnn.com looked like on September 3, 2008, it would have shown you a page featuring stories about the 2008 McCain-Obama Presidential race, but the advertisement alongside it would have been for the 2012 Romney-Obama debate. Another problem is that there is no equivalent to what, in a physical archive, is a perfect provenance. Last July, when the computer scientist Michael Nelson tweeted the archived screenshots of Strelkovâs page, a man in St. Petersburg tweeted back, âYep. Perfect tool to produce âevidenceâ of any kind.â Kahle is careful on this point. When asked to authenticate a screenshot, he says, âWe can say, âThis is what we know. This is what our records say. This is how we received this information, from which apparent Web site, at this IP address.â But to actually say that this happened in the past is something that we canât say, in an ontological way.â Nevertheless, screenshots from Web archives have held up in court, repeatedly. And, as Kahle points out, âThey turn out to be much more trustworthy than most of what people try to base court decisions on.â\n\n\n\nYou can do something more like keyword searching in smaller subject collections, but nothing like Google searching (there is no relevance ranking, for instance), because the tools for doing anything meaningful with Web archives are years behind the tools for creating those archives. Doing research in a paper archive is to doing research in a Web archive as going to a fish market is to being thrown in the middle of an ocean; the only thing they have in common is that both involve fish.\n\n\n\nThe Web archivists at the British Library had the brilliant idea of bringing in a team of historians to see what they could do with the U.K. Web Archive; it wasnât all that much, but it was helpful to see what they _tried_ to do, and why it didnât work. Gareth Millward, a young scholar interested in the history of disability, wanted to trace the history of the Royal National Institute for the Blind. It turned out that the institute had endorsed a talking watch, and its name appeared in every advertisement for the watch. âThis one advert appears thousands of times in the database,â Millward told me. It cluttered and bogged down nearly everything he attempted. Last year, the Internet Archive made an archive of its .gov domain, tidied up and compressed the data, and made it available to a group of scholars, who tried very hard to make something of the material. It was so difficult to recruit scholars to use the data that the project was mostly a wash. Kahle says, âI give it a B.â Stanfordâs Web archivist, Nicholas Taylor, thinks itâs a chicken-and-egg problem. âWe donât know what tools to build, because no research has been done, but the research hasnât been done because we havenât built any tools.â\n\n\n\nThe footnote problem, though, stands a good chance of being fixed. Last year, a tool called Perma.cc was launched. It was developed by the Harvard Library Innovation Lab, and its founding supporters included more than sixty law-school libraries, along with the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society, the Internet Archive, the Legal Information Preservation Alliance, and the Digital Public Library of America. Perma.cc promises âto create citation links that will never break.â It works something like the Wayback Machineâs âSave Page Now.â If youâre writing a scholarly paper and want to use a link in your footnotes, you can create an archived version of the page youâre linking to, a âpermalink,â and anyone later reading your footnotes will, when clicking on that link, be brought to the permanently archived version. Perma.cc has already been adopted by law reviews and state courts; itâs only a matter of time before itâs universally adopted as the standard in legal, scientific, and scholarly citation.\n\n\n\nPerma.cc is a patch, an excellent patch. Herbert Van de Sompel, a Belgian computer scientist who works at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, is trying to reweave the fabric of the Web. Itâs not possible to go back in time and rewrite the HTTP protocol, but Van de Sompelâs work involves adding to it. He and Michael Nelson are part of the team behind Memento, a protocol that you can use on Google Chrome as a Web extension, so that you can navigate from site to site, and from time to time. He told me, âMemento allows you to say, âI donât want to see this link where it points me to today; I want to see it around the time that this page was written, for example.âÂ â It searches not only the Wayback Machine but also every major public Web archive in the world, to find the page closest in time to the time youâd like to travel to. (âA world with one archive is a really bad idea,â Van de Sompel points out. âYou need redundance.â) This month, the Memento group is launching a Web portal called Time Travel. Eventually, if Memento and projects like it work, the Web will have a time dimension, a way to get from now to then, effortlessly, a fourth dimension. And then the past will be inescapable, which is as terrifying as it is interesting.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAt the back of the chapel, up a short flight of stairs, there are two niches, arched alcoves the same shape and size as the stained-glass windows. Three towers of computers stand within each niche, and ten computers are stacked in each tower: black, rectangular, and humming. There are towers like this all over the building; these are only six of them. Still, this is _it_.\n\n\n\n\n\nKahle stands on his tiptoes, sinks back into his sneakers, and then bounds up the stairs. He is like a very sweet boy who, having built a very fine snowman, drags his mother outdoors to see it before it melts. I almost expect him to take my hand. I follow him up the stairs.\n\n\n\nâThink of them as open stacks,â he says, showing me the racks. âYou can walk right up to them and touch them.â He reaches out and traces the edge of one of the racks with the tip of his index finger. âIf you had all the words in every book in the Library of Congress, it would be about an inch, here,â he says, measuring the distance between his forefinger and thumb.\n\n\n\nUp close, theyâre noisy. Itâs mainly fans, cooling the machines. At first, the noise was a problem: a library is supposed to be quiet. Kahle had soundproofing built into the walls.\n\n\n\nEach unit has a yellow and a green light, glowing steadily: power indicators. Then, there are blue lights, flickering.\n\n\n\nâEvery time a light blinks, someone is uploading or downloading,â Kahle explains. Six hundred thousand people use the Wayback Machine every day, conducting two thousand searches a second. âYou can _see_ it.â He smiles as he watches. âTheyâre glowing books!â He waves his arms. âThey glow when theyâre being read!â\n\n\n\nOne day last summer, a missile was launched into the sky and a plane crashed in a field. âWe just downed a plane,â a soldier told the world. People fell to the earth, their last passage. Somewhere, someone hit âSave Page Now.â\n\n\n\nWhere is the Internetâs memory, the history of our time?\n\n\n\nâItâs right _here!_â Kahle cries.\n\n\n\nThe machine hums and is muffled. It is sacred and profane. It is eradicable and unbearable. And it glows, against the dark.Â â¦","canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59112e62f8fa3e67faf0d229","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ffbc1c7a8e33fb390bc3","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jill Lepore, a staff writer, has been contributing toÂ *The New Yorker*Â since 2005.

Journalism has played a role in this. On October 10, 2017, *The New Yorker* published the [first in a series of articles](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories) by Ronan Farrow in which women brought allegations of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment against the film executive Harvey Weinstein. (Weinstein denied that he had committed rape or sexual assault.) Farrowâs story came several days after a remarkable [story in the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html?_r=0), by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, reported allegations that Weinstein had sexually harassed multiple women and paid them for their silence. As interest in the accusations against Weinstein crested, the actress Alyssa Milano posted to Twitter, âIf youâve been sexually harassed or assaulted write âme tooâ as a reply to this tweet,â prompting thousands of women (and men) to reactivate a slogan that the activist Tarana Burke had coined in 2006\\. Almost instantly, #MeToo became shorthand for a decentralized campaign against gender-based violence and abuse. Weinstein was hardly the first powerful man to be investigated for disgraceful behavior toward womenâRoger Ailes and Bill OâReilly at Fox News preceded himâbut Weinsteinâs fall catalyzed the movement, and what followed has been a long line of prominent men in politics, media, show business, corporate leadership, and many other fields who have been called to account.\n\nTo mark a tumultuous year, we asked eight of our writers to look back on #MeToo in order to anticipate what couldâor shouldâcome next. As it happens, we gave them this assignment in the midst of the battle over [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh)âs appointment to the Supreme Court. Kavanaughâs ascent to the nationâs highest court has only intensified the discussion of #MeToo, and is bound to play a critical role in the midterm elections next month. In this package, Jia Tolentino assesses the backlash against #MeToo, while Masha Gessen asks what real justice for victims could look like. Amanda Petrusich measures her own anger while also taking solace in the relative optimism of her students. Doreen St. FÃ©lix describes the movementâs need for a more flexible language. Helen Rosner sizes up the ongoing reckoning in the restaurant industry. Katy Waldman looks at the movementâs impact on the literary world. Han Zhang reports on how #MeToo spread via social media and chat apps in China, eluding government surveillance. And Allyson Hobbs writes about her own sexual assault and African-American traditions of testimony. Right now, many women and men are searching for rational answers to questions about the workplace, about justice, and about the ways in which we conduct our private lives.

According to a recent [Harris/Axios](https://www.axios.com/facebook-reputation-drops-axios-harris-poll-0d6c406a-4c2e-463a-af98-1748d3e0ab9a.html) survey of the hundred most visible companies in the U.S., Facebookâs reputation has taken a precipitous dive in the last five years, with its most acute plunge in the past year, and it scores particularly low in the categories of citizenship, ethics, and trust.\n\nWhile Zuckerbergâs blog post can be read as a response to this loss of faith, it is also a strategic move to capitalize on [the social-media platformâs failures](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/facebooks-very-bad-month-just-got-worse). To be clear, what Zuckerberg calls âtown squareâ Facebook, where people post updates about new jobs, and share prom pictures and erroneous information about vaccines, will continue to exist. (On Thursday, Facebook [announced](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/07/facebook-anti-vaxx-vaccine-hoax-ads) that it would ban anti-vaccine advertisements on the site.) His new vision is to create a separate product that merges Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram into an encrypted and interoperable communications platform that will be more like a âliving room.â According to Zuckerberg, âWeâve worked hard to build privacy into all our products, including those for public sharing. But one great property of messaging services is that, even as your contacts list grows, your individual threads and groups remain private. As your friends evolve over time, messaging services evolve gracefully and remain intimate.â\n\nThis new Facebook promises to store data securely in the cloud, and delete messages after a set amount of time to reduce âthe risk of your messages resurfacing and embarrassing you later.â (Apparently, Zuckerberg already uses this feature, as [Tech Crunch reported](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages), in April, 2018.) Its interoperability means, for example, that users will be able to buy something from Facebook Marketplace and communicate with the seller via WhatsApp; Zuckerberg says this will enable the buyer to avoid sharing a phone number with a stranger. Just last week, however, [a user discovered](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-phone-number-that-secures-your-facebook-account-isnt-as-safe-as-you-think-2019-03-04) that phone numbers provided for two-factor authentication on Facebook can be used to track people across the Facebook universe. Zuckerberg does not address how the new product will handle this feature, since âtown squareâ Facebook will continue to exist.\n\nOnce Facebook has merged all of its products, the company plans to build other products on top of it, including payment portals, banking services, and, not surprisingly, advertising. In an [interview with *Wiredâs*](https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-privacy-pivot/) editor-in-chief, Nicholas Thompson, Zuckerberg explained that âWhat Iâm trying to lay out is a privacy-focused vision for this kind of platform that starts with messaging and making that as secure as possible with end-to-end encryption, and then building all of the other kinds of private and intimate ways that you would want to interactâfrom calling, to groups, to stories, to payments, to different forms of commerce, to sharing location, to eventually having a more open-ended system to plug in different kinds of tools for providing the interaction with people in all the ways that you would want.â \n\nIf this sounds familiar, it is. Zuckerbergâs concept borrows liberally from WeChat, the multiverse Chinese social-networking platform, popularly known as Chinaâs â[app for everything](https://the-parallax.com/2018/06/21/meet-wechat-everything-app-china/).â WeChatâs billion monthly active users employ the app for texting, video conferencing, broadcasting, money transfers, paying fines, and making medical appointments. Privacy, however, is not one of its attributes. According to a 2015 article in [*Quartz*](https://qz.com/518908/wechats-new-heat-map-feature-lets-users-and-chinese-authorities-see-where-crowds-are-forming/), WeChatâs âheat mapâ feature alerts Chinese authorities to unusual crowds of people, which the government can then surveil.\n\nZuckerberg is quick to point out that his vision for this new Facebook is aspirational. It has not yet been built, and it is not certain that it *can* be builtâat least in the way he imagines itâwith across-the-board encryption. âI believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content wonât stick around forever,â Zuckerberg tells us. âThis is the future I hope we will help bring about.â By announcing it now, and framing it in terms of privacy, he appears to be addressing the concerns of both users and regulators, while failing to acknowledge that a consolidated Facebook will provide advertisers with an even richer and more easily accessed database of users than the site currently offers. As [*Wired* reported](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/facebook-whatsapp-merger) in January, when the merger of Facebookâs apps was floated in the press, âthe move will unlock huge quantities of user information that was previously locked away in silos.â ( As Privacy Matters recently [noted](https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters/status/1052562585223073793) on Twitter, Facebookâs data policy states, âWe collect information about the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups that you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or groups that you are part of.â)\n\nZuckerberg also acknowledged that an encrypted Facebook may pose problems for law enforcement and intelligence services, but promised that the company would work with authorities to root out bad guys who âmisuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion.â Itâs unclear how, with end-to-end encryption, it will be able to do this. Facebookâs private groups have already been used to incite genocide and other acts of violence, suppress voter turnout, and disseminate misinformation. Its pivot to privacy will not only give such activities more space to operate behind the relative shelter of a digital wall but will also relieve Facebook from the responsibility of policing them. Instead of moreâand more exactingâcontent moderation, there will be less. Instead of removing bad actors from the service, the pivot to privacy will give them a safe harbor. \n\nIf âtown squareâ Facebook is, as Zuckerberg and his associates like to say, âa neutral platform,â this new âliving roomâ Facebook, where people gather in smallish, obscure groups, is likely to be a broadcast channel for all sorts of odious and malevolent ideas and behaviors. Weâve seen this already on WhatsApp. Last year, mobs in India were incited to kill more than two dozen innocent people after false rumors of a child-kidnapping ring were spread through the messaging app. As the New York *Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/technology/whatsapp-india-killings.html) at the time, âWhatsAppâs design makes it easy to spread false information. Many messages are shared in groups, and when they are forwarded, there is no indication of their origin.â (According to the *Times,* WhatsApp subsequently introduced new labels for forwarded messages, ran newspaper ads to warn the public about misinformation, and vowed to work more closely with police.) Instagram has also been an effective tool for spreading misinformation. According to data shared with the Senate Intelligence Committee last December, between [2015 and 2017](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tech-giants-have-done-bare-minimum-to-help-russia-investigation-senate-intel-committee-told), Russian propagandists working out of the Internet Research Agency generated posts that garnered a hundred and eighty-seven million interactions on the photo-sharing app, which was more engagement than they accomplished on either Facebook or Twitter. An encrypted Instagram will be a boon to trolls.\n\nLast week, the relentless British journalist Carole Cadwalladr, along with her colleague Duncan Campbell, [reported in the *Observer*](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment) that Facebook has been pressuring politicians around the world to lobby against imposing regulations on the social network, offering investments and other incentives. (A Facebook spokesperson told the *Observer* that the documents forming the basis of the reporting were âcherrypicked.â) In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is considering whether to fine Facebook billions of dollars for violating a 2011 consent decree intended to protect usersâ private data. In Wednesdayâs announcement, Zuckerberg, who is famous for shambling apologies, seemed to have finally run out of mea culpas. âI understand that many people donât think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform,â he wrote, âbecause frankly we donât currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services.â On that point, at least, heâs right.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Facebook","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark

Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg), the C.E.O. of Facebook, has been posting occasional essays about the future of his company. The most recent, published on Wednesday, outlines âa privacy-focused vision for social networking.â âPublic social networks will continue to be very important in peopleâs lives,â Zuckerberg writes. But âthe future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services.â He hopes to build such platforms, and expand the ones the company already owns. He isnât proposing to dismantle Facebook as it currently exists. The Facebook to come, he explains, will facilitate âprivate interactionsâ; it will feature âreduced permanence,â with content disappearing automatically, Snapchat-style; it will allow for messages, video chats, monetary transactions, and âother kinds of private servicesâ that are encrypted âend-to-end.â (This type of encryption âprevents anyoneâincluding usâfrom seeing what people share,â Zuckerberg explains.)  Zuckerberg wants to supplement âthe platforms weâve already built to help people share and connect more openlyâ with âplatforms for private sharing.â The idea is to let you use Facebook in secret.\n\nThe move toward privacy seems designed to respond to a number of problems. To some extent, it responds to Facebookâs content-moderation problem: if a conversation that violates the companyâs âcommunity guidelinesâ is encrypted, such that even Facebookâs software canât read it, then the company canât be expected to expunge it. It responds to the Ralph Northam-yearbook problem (âPeople want to know that what they share wonât come back to hurt them laterâ), since, by default, content will auto-delete.  And it responds to the China problem, as Zuckerberg vows ânot to build data centers in countries that have a track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression.â It also attempts to address Facebookâs public-relations problem: after a scandalous year, fewer people trust the network than ever.\n\nWhat it does not and cannot address is the social-media problem. That problem, essentially, is centralization. Itâs extraordinary that one companyâand, to an extent, one personâhas the power to reshape the way that billions of people communicate, not just once but over and over again. In its original incarnation, Facebook helped turn ordinary people into broadcasters; this had predictable, desirable consequences (baby photos; gratitude challenges; rainbow-hued demonstrations of solidarity) and unpredictable, disastrous ones (harassment; anti-vaxxers; Russian trolls). Almost certainly, Facebookâs privacy initiatives will result in good and bad outcomes that are hard to predictâand those outcomes, whatever they are, will unfold at a massive, global scale, affecting societies around the world simultaneously. That scale, in itself, is a problemâone that Facebook will never solve.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c78ee7fe02cbd163327","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Privacy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"privacy"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e5e72179605b11ad9914","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Joshua RothmanÂ is *The New Yorkerâs* archive editor.

He does not enjoy interviews, especially after two years of ceaseless controversy. Having got his start as a programmer with a nocturnal bent, he is also not a morning person. Walking toward the kitchen, which has a long farmhouse table and cabinets painted forest green, he said, âI havenât eaten breakfast yet. Have you?â\n\nSince 2011, Zuckerberg has lived in a century-old white clapboard Craftsman in the Crescent Park neighborhood, an enclave of giant oaks and historic homes not far from Stanford University. The house, which cost seven million dollars, affords him a sense of sanctuary. Itâs set back from the road, shielded by hedges, a wall, and mature trees. Guests enter through an arched wooden gate and follow a long gravel path to a front lawn with a saltwater pool in the center. The year after Zuckerberg bought the house, he and his longtime girlfriend, Priscilla Chan, held their wedding in the back yard, which encompasses gardens, a pond, and a shaded pavilion. Since then, they have had two children, and acquired a seven-hundred-acre estate in Hawaii, a ski retreat in Montana, and a four-story town house on Liberty Hill, in San Francisco. But the familyâs full-time residence is here, a ten-minute drive from Facebookâs headquarters.\n\nOccasionally, Zuckerberg records a Facebook video from the back yard or the dinner table, as is expected of a man who built his fortune exhorting employees to keep âpushing the world in the direction of making it a more open and transparent place.â But his appetite for personal openness is limited. Although Zuckerberg is the most famous entrepreneur of his generation, he remains elusive to everyone but a small circle of family and friends, and his efforts to protect his privacy inevitably attract attention. The local press has chronicled his feud with a developer who announced plans to build a mansion that would look into Zuckerbergâs master bedroom. After a legal fight, the developer gave up, and Zuckerberg spent forty-four million dollars to buy the houses surrounding his. Over the years, he has come to believe that he will always be the subject of criticism. âWeâre notâpick your noncontroversial businessâselling dog food, although I think that people who do that probably say there is controversy in that, too, but this is an inherently cultural thing,â he told me, of his business. âItâs at the intersection of technology and psychology, and itâs very personal.â\n\nHe carried a plate of banana bread and a carafe of water into the living room, and settled onto a navy-blue velvet sofa. Since co-founding Facebook, in 2004, his uniform has evolved from hoodies and flip-flops to his current outfit, a gray sweater, indigo jeans, and black Nikes. At thirty-four, Zuckerberg, who has very fair skin, a tall forehead, and large eyes, is leaner than when he first became a public figure, more than a decade ago. On the porch, next to the front door, he keeps a Peloton stationary bike, a favorite accessory in the tech world, which live-streams a personal trainer to your home. Zuckerberg uses the machine, but he does not love cycling. A few years ago, on his first attempt to use a road bike with racing pedals, he forgot to unclip, tipped over, and broke his arm. Except for cycling on his porch, he said, âI havenât clipped in since.â\n\nHe and his wife prefer board games to television, and, within reach of the couch, I noticed a game called Ricochet Robots. âIt gets extremely competitive,â Zuckerberg said. âWe play with these friends, and one of them is a genius at this. Playing with him is just infuriating.â Dave Morin, a former Facebook employee who is the founder and C.E.O. of Sunrise Bio, a startup seeking cures for depression, used to play Risk with Zuckerberg at the office. âHeâs not playing you in a game of Risk. Heâs playing you in a game of games,â Morin told me. âThe first game, he might amass all his armies on one property, and the next game he might spread them all over the place. Heâs trying to figure out the psychological way to beat you in all the games.â\n\nAcross the tech industry, the depth of Zuckerbergâs desire to win is often remarked upon. Dick Costolo, the former C.E.O. of [Twitter](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Twitter), told me, âHeâs a ruthless execution machine, and if he has decided to come after you, youâre going to take a beating.â Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, said, âThere are a number of people in the Valley who have a perception of Mark that heâs really aggressive and competitive. I think some people are a little hesitant about him from that perspective.â Hoffman has been an investor in Facebook since its early days, but for a long time he sensed that Zuckerberg kept his distance because they were both building social networks. âFor many years, it was, like, âYour LinkedIn thing is going to be crushed, so even though weâre friendly, I donât want to get too close to you personally, because Iâm going to crush you.â Now, of course, thatâs behind us and weâre good friends.â\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about this reputation, he framed the dynamic differently. The survival of any social-media business rests on ânetwork effects,â in which the value of the network grows only by finding new users. As a result, he said, âthereâs a natural zero-sumness. If weâre going to achieve what we want to, itâs not just about building the best features. Itâs about building the best community.â He added, âI care about succeeding. And, yes, sometimes you have to beat someone to something, in order to get to the next thing. But thatâs not primarily the way that I think I roll.â\n\nFor many years, Zuckerberg ended Facebook meetings with the half-joking exhortation âDomination!â Although he eventually stopped doing this (in European legal systems, âdominanceâ refers to corporate monopoly), his discomfort with losing is undimmed. A few years ago, he played Scrabble on a corporate jet with a friendâs daughter, who was in high school at the time. She won. Before they played a second game, he wrote a simple computer program that would look up his letters in the dictionary so that he could choose from all possible words. Zuckerbergâs program had a narrow lead when the flight landed. The girl told me, âDuring the game in which I was playing the program, everyone around us was taking sides: Team Human and Team Machine.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIf Facebook were a country, it would have the largest population on earth. More than 2.2 billion people, about a third of humanity, log in at least once a month. That user base has no precedent in the history of American enterprise. Fourteen years after it was founded, in Zuckerbergâs dorm room, Facebook has as many adherents as Christianity.\n\nA couple of years ago, the company was still revelling in its power. By collecting vast quantities of information about its users, it allows advertisers to target people with precisionâa business model that earns Facebook more ad revenue in a year than all American newspapers combined. Zuckerberg was spending much of his time conferring with heads of state and unveiling plans of fantastical ambition, such as building giant drones that would beam free Internet (including Facebook) into developing countries. He enjoyed extraordinary control over his company; in addition to his positions as chairman and C.E.O., he controlled about sixty per cent of shareholder votes, thanks to a special class of stock with ten times the power of ordinary shares. His personal fortune had grown to more than sixty billion dollars. Facebook was one of four companies (along with Google, Amazon, and Apple) that dominated the Internet; the combined value of their stock is larger than the G.D.P. of France.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfdbd07a5060baeb7b]||||||\n+++\n\nFor years, Facebook had heard concerns about its use of private data and its ability to shape peopleâs behavior. The companyâs troubles came to a head during the Presidential election of 2016, when propagandists used the site to spread misinformation that helped turn society against itself. Some of the culprits were profiteers who gamed Facebookâs automated systems with toxic political clickbait known as âfake news.â In a prime example, at least a hundred Web sites were traced to Veles, Macedonia, a small city where entrepreneurs, some still in high school, discovered that posting fabrications to pro-[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) Facebook groups unleashed geysers of traffic. Fake-news sources also paid Facebook to âmicrotargetâ ads at users who had proved susceptible in the past.\n\nThe other culprits, according to U.S. intelligence, were Russian agents who wanted to sow political chaos and help Trump win. In February, [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), the special counsel investigating Russiaâs role in the election, charged thirteen Russians with an âinterference operationâ that made use of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The Internet Research Agency, a firm in St. Petersburg working for the Kremlin, drew hundreds of thousands of users to Facebook groups optimized to stoke outrage, including Secured Borders, Blacktivist, and Defend the 2nd. They used Facebook to organize offline rallies, and bought Facebook ads intended to hurt Hillary Clintonâs standing among Democratic voters. (One read âHillary Clinton Doesnât Deserve the Black Vote.â) With fewer than a hundred operatives, the I.R.A. achieved an astonishing impact: Facebook estimates that the content reached as many as a hundred and fifty million users.\n\nAt the same time, former Facebook executives, echoing a growing body of research, began to voice misgivings about the companyâs role in exacerbating isolation, outrage, and addictive behaviors. One of the largest studies, published last year in the _American Journal of Epidemiology_, followed the Facebook use of more than five thousand people over three years and found that higher use correlated with self-reported declines in physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction. At an event in November, 2017, Sean Parker, Facebookâs first president, called himself a âconscientious objectorâ to social media, saying, âGod only knows what itâs doing to our childrenâs brains.â A few days later, Chamath Palihapitiya, the former vice-president of user growth, told an audience at Stanford, âThe short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society worksâno civil discourse, no coÃ¶peration, misinformation, mistruth.â Palihapitiya, a prominent [Silicon Valley](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Silicon-Valley) figure who worked at Facebook from 2007 to 2011, said, âI feel tremendous guilt. I think we all knew in the back of our minds.â Of his children, he added, âTheyâre not allowed to use this shit.â (Facebook replied to the remarks in a statement, noting that Palihapitiya had left six years earlier, and adding, âFacebook was a very different company back then.â)\n\nIn March, Facebook was confronted with an even larger scandal: the _Times_ and the British newspaper the _Observer_ reported that a researcher had gained access to the personal information of Facebook users and sold it to [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Cambridge-Analytica), a consultancy hired by Trump and other Republicans which advertised using âpsychographicâ techniques to manipulate voter behavior. In all, the personal data of eighty-seven million people had been harvested. Moreover, Facebook had known of the problem since December of 2015 but had said nothing to users or regulators. The company acknowledged the breach only after the press discovered it.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica revelations touched off the most serious crisis in Facebookâs history, and, with it, a public reckoning with the power of Big Tech. Facebook is now under investigation by the F.B.I., the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as by authorities abroad, from London to Brussels to Sydney. Facebookâs peers and rivals have expressed conspicuously little sympathy. [Elon Musk](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Elon-Musk) deleted his Facebook pages and those of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. [Tim Cook](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Tim-Cook), the C.E.O. of Apple, told an interviewer, âWe could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer,â but âweâve elected not to do that.â At Facebookâs annual shareholder meeting, in May, executives struggled to keep order. An investor who interrupted the agenda to argue against Zuckerbergâs renomination as chairman was removed. Outside, an airplane flew a banner that read â*YOU BROKE DEMOCRACY.*{: .small}â It was paid for by Freedom from Facebook, a coalition of progressive groups that have asked the F.T.C. to break up the company into smaller units.\n\nOn July 25th, Facebookâs stock price dropped nineteen per cent, cutting its market value by a hundred and nineteen billion dollars, the largest one-day drop in Wall Street history. Nick Bilton, a technology writer at _Vanity Fair_, tweeted that Zuckerberg was losing $2.7 million per second, âdouble what the average American makes in an entire lifetime.â Facebookâs user base had flatlined in the U.S. and Canada, and dropped slightly in Europe, and executives warned that revenue growth would decline further, in part because the scandals had led users to opt out of allowing Facebook to collect some data. Facebook depends on trust, and the events of the past two years had made people wonder whether the company deserved it.\n\nZuckerbergâs friends describe his travails as a by-product of his success. He is often compared to another Harvard dropout, [Bill Gates](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Bill-Gates), who has been his mentor in business and philanthropy. Gates told me, âSomebody who is smart, and rich, and ends up not acknowledging problems as quickly as they should will be attacked as arrogant. That comes with the territory.â He added, âI wouldnât say that Markâs an arrogant individual.â But, to critics, Facebook is guilty of a willful blindness driven by greed, naÃ¯vetÃ©, and contempt for oversight.\n\nIn a series of conversations over the summer, I talked to Zuckerberg about Facebookâs problems, and about his underlying views on technology and society. We spoke at his home, at his office, and by phone. I also interviewed four dozen people inside and outside the company about its culture, his performance, and his decision-making. I found Zuckerberg straining, not always coherently, to grasp problems for which he was plainly unprepared. These are not technical puzzles to be cracked in the middle of the night but some of the subtlest aspects of human affairs, including the meaning of truth, the limits of free speech, and the origins of violence.\n\nZuckerberg is now at the center of a full-fledged debate about the moral character of Silicon Valley and the conscience of its leaders. Leslie Berlin, a historian of technology at Stanford, told me, âFor a long time, Silicon Valley enjoyed an unencumbered embrace in America. And now everyone says, Is this a trick? And the question Mark Zuckerberg is dealing with is: Should my company be the arbiter of truth and decency for two billion people? Nobody in the history of technology has dealt with that.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFacebookâs headquarters, at 1 Hacker Way, in Menlo Park, overlooking the salt marshes south of San Francisco, has the feel of a small, prosperous dictatorship, akin to Kuwait or Brunei. The campus is a self-contained universe, with the full range of free Silicon Valley perks: dry cleaning, haircuts, music lessons, and food by the acre, including barbecue, biryani, and salad bars. (New arrivals are said to put on the âFacebook fifteen.â) Along with stock options and generous benefits, such trappings have roots in the nineteen-seventies, when, Leslie Berlin said, founders aspired to create pleasant workplaces and stave off the rise of labor unions. The campus, which was designed with the help of consultants from Disney, is arranged as an ersatz town that encircles a central plaza, with shops and restaurants and offices along a main street. From the air, the word â*Hack*{: .small}â is visible in gigantic letters on the plaza pavement.\n\nOn Zuckerbergâs campus, he is king. Executives offer fulsome praise. David Marcus, who runs Facebookâs blockchain project, told me recently, âWhen I see him portrayed in certain ways, it really hurts me personally, because itâs not the guy he is.â Even when colleagues speak more candidly, on the whole they like him. âHeâs not an asshole,â a former senior executive told me. âThatâs why people work there so long.â\n\nBefore I visited Zuckerberg for the first time, in June, members of his staff offered the kind of advice usually reserved for approaching a skittish bird: proceed gingerly, build a connection, avoid surprises. The advice, I discovered, wasnât necessary. In person, he is warmer and more direct than his public pronouncements, which resemble a politicianâs bland pablum, would suggest. The contrast between the public and the private Zuckerberg reminded me of Hillary Clinton. In both cases, friends complain that the popular image is divorced from the casual, funny, generous person they know. Yet neither Zuckerberg nor Clinton has found a way to publicly express a more genuine persona. In Zuckerbergâs case, moments of self-reflection are so rare that, last spring, following a CNN interview in which he said that he wanted to build a company that âmy girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for,â the network framed the clip as a news event, with the title âZuckerberg in rare emotional moment.â\n\nI asked Zuckerberg about his aversion to opening up.âIâm not the most polished person, and I will say something wrong, and you see the cost of that,â he said. âI donât want to inflict that pain, or do something thatâs going to not reflect well on the people around me.â In the most recent flap, a few weeks earlier, he had told Kara Swisher, the host of the â[Recode Decode](https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575158/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-full-transcript-kara-swisher)â podcast, that he permits Holocaust deniers on Facebook because he isnât sure if they are âintentionally getting it wrong.â After a furor erupted, he issued a statement saying that he finds Holocaust denial âdeeply offensive.â Zuckerberg told me, âIn an alternate world where there werenât the compounding experiences that I had, I probably would have gotten more comfortable being more personal, and out there, and I wouldnât have felt pushback every time I did something. And maybe my persona, or at least how I felt comfortable acting publicly, would shift.â\n\nThe downside of Zuckerbergâs exalted status within his company is that it is difficult for him to get genuine, unexpurgated feedback. He has tried, at times, to puncture his own bubble. In 2013, as a New Yearâs resolution, he pledged to meet someone new, outside Facebook, every day. In 2017, he travelled to more than thirty states on a âlistening tourâ that he hoped would better acquaint him with the outside world. David Plouffe, President Obamaâs former campaign manager, who is now the head of policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the familyâs philanthropic investment company, attended some events on the tour. He told me, âWhen a politician goes to one of those, itâs an hour, and theyâre talking for fifty of those minutes. He would talk for, like, five, and just ask questions.â\n\nBut the exercise came off as stilted and tone-deaf. Zuckerberg travelled with a professional photographer, who documented him feeding a calf in Wisconsin, ordering barbecue, and working on an assembly line at a Ford plant in Michigan. Online, people joked that the photos made him look like an extraterrestrial exploring the human race for the first time. A former Facebook executive who was involved in the tour told a friend, âNo one wanted to tell Mark, and no one did tell Mark, that this really looks just dumb.â\n\nZuckerberg has spent nearly half his life inside a company of his own making, handpicking his lieutenants, and sculpting his environment to suit him. Even Facebookâs signature royal blue reflects his tastes. He is red-green color-blind, and he chose blue because he sees it most vividly. [Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Sheryl-Sandberg), the chief operating officer, told me, âSometimes Mark will say, in front of the company, âWell, Iâve never worked anywhere else, but Sheryl tells meÂ .&#160;.&#160;.â&#160;â She went on, âHe acknowledges he doesnât always have the most experience. Heâs only had the experience heâs had, and being Mark Zuckerberg is pretty extraordinary.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nLong before it seemed inevitable or even plausible, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg had an outsized sense of his own potential. It was âa teleological frame of feeling almost chosen,â a longtime friend told me. âI think Mark has always seen himself as a man of history, someone who is destined to be great, and I mean that in the broadest sense of the term.â Zuckerberg has observed that more than a few giants of history grew up in bourgeois comfort near big cities and then channelled those advantages into transformative power.\n\nIn Zuckerbergâs case, the setting was Dobbs Ferry, New York, a Westchester County suburb twenty-five miles north of New York City. His mother, Karen Kempner, grew up in Queens; on a blind date, she met a mailmanâs son, Edward Zuckerberg, of Flatbush, who was studying to be a dentist. They married and had four children. Mark, the only boy, was the second-oldest. His mother, who had become a psychiatrist, eventually gave up her career to take care of the kids and manage the dental office, which was connected to the family home. Of his father, Zuckerberg told me, âHe was a dentist, but he was also a huge techie. So he always had not just a system for drilling teeth but, like, the laser system for drilling teeth that was controlled by the computer.â Ed Zuckerberg marketed himself as the Painless Dr. Z, and later drummed up dentistry business with a direct-mail solicitation that declared, âI am literally the Father of Facebook!â (Since 2013, Zuckerbergâs parents have lived in California, where Ed practices part time and lectures on using social media to attract patients.)\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf2c0c1035aeefc65e]||||||\n+++\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Ed bought early personal computersâthe Atari 800, the I.B.M. XTâand Mark learned to code. At twelve, he set up his first network, ZuckNet, on which messages and files could be shared between the house and his fatherâs dental office. Rabbi David Holtz, of Temple Beth Abraham, in Tarrytown, told me that he watched Zuckerberg with other kids and sensed that he was âbeyond a lot of his peers. He was thinking about things that other people were not.â When I asked Zuckerberg where his drive came from, he traced it to his grandparents, who had immigrated from Europe in the early twentieth century. âThey came over, went through the Great Depression, had very hard lives,â he said. âTheir dream for their kids was that they would each become doctors, which they did, and my mom just always believed that we should have a bigger impact.â His eldest sister, Randi, an early Facebook spokesperson, has gone on to write books and host a radio show; Donna received her Ph.D. in classics from Princeton and edits an online classics journal; Arielle has worked at Google and as a venture capitalist.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg was a junior in high school, he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he spent most of his time coding, fencing, and studying Latin. Ancient Rome became a lifelong fascination, first because of the language (âItâs very much like coding or math, and so I appreciated thatâ) and then because of the history. Zuckerberg told me, âYou have all these good and bad and complex figures. I think Augustus is one of the most fascinating. Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace.â For non-classics majors: Augustus Caesar, born in 63 B.C., staked his claim to power at the age of eighteen and turned Rome from a republic into an empire by conquering Egypt, northern Spain, and large parts of central Europe. He also eliminated political opponents, banished his daughter for promiscuity, and was suspected of arranging the execution of his grandson.\n\nâWhat are the trade-offs in that?â Zuckerberg said, growing animated. âOn the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today. Two hundred years feels unattainable.â On the other hand, he said, âthat didnât come for free, and he had to do certain things.â In 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan spent their honeymoon in Rome. He later said, âMy wife was making fun of me, saying she thought there were three people on the honeymoon: me, her, and Augustus. All the photos were different sculptures of Augustus.â The couple named their second daughter August.\n\nIn 2002, Zuckerberg went to [Harvard](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvard), where he embraced the hacker mystique, which celebrates brilliance in pursuit of disruption. âThe âfuck youâ to those in power was very strong,â the longtime friend said. In 2004, as a sophomore, he embarked on the project whose origin story is now well known: the founding of Thefacebook.com with four fellow-students (âtheâ was dropped the following year); the legal battles over ownership, including a suit filed by twin brothers, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, accusing Zuckerberg of stealing their idea; the disclosure of embarrassing messages in which Zuckerberg mocked users for giving him so much data (âthey âtrust me.â dumb fucks,â he wrote); his regrets about those remarks, and his efforts, in the years afterward, to convince the world that he has left that mind-set behind.\n\nDuring Zuckerbergâs sophomore year, in line for the bathroom at a party, he met Priscilla Chan, who was a freshman. Her parents, who traced their roots to China, had grown up in Vietnam and arrived in the U.S. as refugees after the war, settling in Quincy, Massachusetts, where they washed dishes in a Chinese restaurant. Priscilla was the eldest of three daughters, and the first member of her family to go to college. âI suddenly go to Harvard, where thereâs this world where people had real and meaningful intellectual pursuits,â she said. âThen I met Mark, who so exemplified that.â She was struck by how little Zuckerbergâs background had in common with her own. âFifty per cent of people go to college from the high school I went to. You could learn how to be a carpenter or a mechanic,â she said. âI was just, like, âThis person speaks a whole new language and lives in a framework that Iâve never seen before.â&#160;â She added, âMaybe there was some judgment on my part: âYou donât understand me because you went to Phillips Exeter,â&#160;â but, she said, âI had to realize early on that I was not going to change who Mark was.â After Harvard, Chan taught in a primary school and eventually became a pediatrician. In 2017, she stopped seeing patients to be the day-to-day head of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. When I asked Chan about how Zuckerberg had responded at home to the criticism of the past two years, she talked to me about _Sitzfleisch_, the German term for sitting and working for long periods of time. âHeâd actually sit so long that he froze up his muscles and injured his hip,â she said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter his sophomore year, Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto and never left. Even by the standards of Silicon Valley, Facebookâs first office had a youthful feel. Zuckerberg carried two sets of business cards. One said âIâm CEOÂ .&#160;.&#160;. bitch!â Visitors encountered a graffiti mural of a scantily clad woman riding a Rottweiler. In Adam Fisherâs â[Valley of Genius](https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Genius-Uncensored-History-Founders/dp/1455559024/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591936&sr=8-1&keywords=valley+of+genius+the+uncensored+history+of+silicon+valley),â an oral history of Silicon Valley, an early employee named Ezra Callahan muses, â&#160;âHow much was the direction of the internet influenced by the perspective of nineteen-, twenty-, twenty-one-year-old well-off white boys?â Thatâs a real question that sociologists will be studying forever.â\n\nFacebook was fortunate to launch when it did: Silicon Valley was recovering from the dot-com bust and was entering a period of near-messianic ambitions. The Internet was no longer so new that users were scarce, but still new enough that it was largely unregulated; first movers could amass vast followings and consolidate power, and the coming rise of inexpensive smartphones would bring millions of new people online. Most important, Facebook capitalized on a resource that most people hardly knew existed: the willingness of users to subsidize the company by handing over colossal amounts of personal information, for free.\n\nIn Facebook, Zuckerberg had found the instrument to achieve his conception of greatness. His onetime speechwriter Katherine Losse, in her memoir, â[The Boy Kings](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Kings-Journey-Social-Network/dp/1451668260/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591916&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Boy+Kings),â explained that the âengineering ideology of Facebookâ was clear: âScaling and growth are everything, individuals and their experiences are secondary to what is necessary to maximize the system.â Over time, Facebook devoted ever-greater focus to what is known in Silicon Valley as âgrowth hacking,â the constant pursuit of scale. Whenever the company talked about âconnecting people,â that was, in effect, code for user growth.\n\nThen, in 2007, growth plateaued at around fifty million users and wouldnât budge. Other social networks had maxed out at around that level, and Facebook employees wondered if they had hit a hidden limit. Zuckerberg created a special Growth Team, which had broad latitude to find ways of boosting the numbers. Among other fixes, they discovered that, by offering the site in more languages, they could open huge markets. Alex Schultz, a founding member of the Growth Team, said that he and his colleagues were fanatical in their pursuit of expansion. âYou will fight for that inch, you will die for that inch,â he told me. Facebook left no opportunity untapped. In 2011, the company asked the Federal Election Commission for an exemption to rules requiring the source of funding for political ads to be disclosed. In filings, a Facebook lawyer argued that the agency âshould not stand in the way of innovation.â\n\nSandy Parakilas, who joined Facebook in 2011, as an operations manager, paraphrased the message of his orientation session as âWe believe in the religion of growth.â He said, âThe Growth Team was the coolest. Other teams would even try to call subgroups within their teams the âGrowth Xâ or the âGrowth Yâ to try to get people excited.â\n\nTo gain greater reach, Facebook had made the fateful decision to become a âplatformâ for outside developers, much as Windows had been in the realm of desktop computers, a generation before. The company had opened its trove of data to programmers who wanted to build Facebook games, personality tests, and other apps. After a few months at Facebook, Parakilas was put in charge of a team responsible for making sure that outsiders were not misusing the data, and he was unnerved by what he found. Some games were siphoning off usersâ messages and photographs. In one case, he said, a developer was harvesting user information, including that of children, to create unauthorized profiles on its own Web site. Facebook had given away data before it had a system to check for abuse. Parakilas suggested that there be an audit to uncover the scale of the problem. But, according to Parakilas, an executive rejected the idea, telling him, âDo you really want to see what youâll find?â\n\nParakilas told me, âIt was very difficult to get the kind of resources that you needed to do a good job of insuring real compliance. Meanwhile, you looked at the Growth Team and they had engineers coming out of their ears. All the smartest minds are focussed on doing whatever they can possibly do to get those growth numbers up.â\n\nNew hires learned that a crucial measure of the companyâs performance was how many people had logged in to Facebook on six of the previous seven days, a measurement known as L6/7\\. âYou could say itâs how many people love this service so much they use it six out of seven days,â Parakilas, who left the company in 2012, said. âBut, if your job is to get that number up, at some point you run out of good, purely positive ways. You start thinking about âWell, what are the dark patterns that I can use to get people to log back in?â&#160;â\n\nFacebook engineers became a new breed of behaviorists, tweaking levers of vanity and passion and susceptibility. The real-world effects were striking. In 2012, when Chan was in medical school, she and Zuckerberg discussed a critical shortage of organs for transplant, inspiring Zuckerberg to add a small, powerful nudge on Facebook: if people indicated that they were organ donors, it triggered a notification to friends, and, in turn, a cascade of social pressure. Researchers later found that, on the first day the feature appeared, it increased official organ-donor enrollment more than twentyfold nationwide.\n\nSean Parker later described the companyâs expertise as âexploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.â The goal: âHow do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?â Facebook engineers discovered that people find it nearly impossible not to log in after receiving an e-mail saying that someone has uploaded a picture of them. Facebook also discovered its power to affect peopleâs political behavior. Researchers found that, during the 2010 midterm elections, Facebook was able to prod users to vote simply by feeding them pictures of friends who had already voted, and by giving them the option to click on an âI Votedâ button. The technique boosted turnout by three hundred and forty thousand peopleâmore than four times the number of votes separating Trump and Clinton in key states in the 2016 race. It became a running joke among employees that Facebook could tilt an election just by choosing where to deploy its âI Votedâ button.\n\nThese powers of social engineering could be put to dubious purposes. In 2012, Facebook data scientists used nearly seven hundred thousand people as guinea pigs, feeding them happy or sad posts to test whether emotion is contagious on social media. (They concluded that it is.) When the findings were published, in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, they caused an uproar among users, many of whom were horrified that their emotions may have been surreptitiously manipulated. In an apology, one of the scientists wrote, âIn hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.â\n\nFacebook was, in the words of Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, becoming a pioneer in âpersuasive technology.â He explained, âA hammer, in your hand, is non-persuasiveâit doesnât have its own ways of manipulating the person that holds it. But Facebook and Snapchat, in their design features, are persuading a teen-ager to wake up and see photo after photo after photo of their friends having fun without them, even if it makes them feel worse.â In 2015, Harris delivered a talk at Facebook about his concern that social media was contributing to alienation. âI said, âYou guys are in the best position in the world to deal with loneliness and see it as a thing that you are amplifying and a thing that you can help make go the other way,â&#160;â he told me. âThey didnât do anything about it.â He added, âMy points were in their blind spot.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook grew, Zuckerberg and his executives adopted a core belief: even if people criticized your decisions, they would eventually come around. In one of the first demonstrations of that idea, in 2006, Facebook introduced the News Feed, a feature that suddenly alerted friends whenever a user changed profile pictures, joined groups, or altered a relationship status. (Until then, users had to visit a friendâs page to see updates.) Users revolted. There was a street protest at the headquarters, and hundreds of thousands of people joined a Facebook group opposing the change. Zuckerberg posted a tepid apology (âCalm down. Breathe. We hear you.â), and people got used to the feed.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab502]||||||\n+++\n\nâA lot of the early experience for me was just having people really not believe that what we were going to do was going to work,â Zuckerberg told me. âIf you think about the early narratives, it was, like, âWell, this was just a college thing.â Or âItâs not gonna be a big deal.â Or âO.K., other people are using it, but itâs kind of a fad. Thereâs Friendster and thereâs MySpace, and there will be something after,â or whatever.â He added, âI feel like it really tests you emotionally to have constant doubt, and the assertion that you donât know what you are doing.â\n\nIn 2006, Zuckerberg made his most unpopular decision at the fledgling company. Yahoo was offering a billion dollars to buy Facebook and, as Matt Cohler, a top aide at the time, recalls, âOur growth had stalled out.â Cohler and many others implored Zuckerberg to take the offer, but he refused. âI think nearly all of his leadership team lost faith in him and in the business,â Cohler said. Zuckerberg told me that most of his leadership âleft within eighteen months. Some of them I had to fire because it was just too dysfunctional. It just completely blew up. But the thing that I learned from that is, if you stick with your values and with what you believe you want to be doing in the world, you can get through. Sometimes it will take some time, and you have to rebuild, but thatâs a pretty powerful lesson.â\n\nOn several occasions, Zuckerberg stumbled when it came to issues of privacy. In 2007, Facebook started giving advertisers a chance to buy into a program called Beacon, which would announce to a userâs friends what that user was browsing for, or buying, online. Users could opt out, but many had no idea that the feature existed until it revealed upcoming holiday gifts, or, in some cases, exposed extramarital affairs. Zuckerberg apologized (âWe simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it,â he wrote), and Beacon was withdrawn.\n\nDespite the apology, Zuckerberg was convinced that he was ahead of his users, not at odds with them. In 2010, he said that privacy was no longer a âsocial norm.â That year, the company found itself in trouble again after it revised its privacy controls to make most information public by default. The Federal Trade Commission cited Facebook for âengaging in unfair and deceptive practicesâ with regard to the privacy of user data. The company signed a consent decree pledging to establish a âcomprehensive privacy programâ and to evaluate it every other year for twenty years. In a post, Zuckerberg offered a qualified apology: âI think that a small number of high profile mistakesÂ .&#160;.&#160;. have often overshadowed much of the good work weâve done.â\n\nFacebook had adopted a buccaneering motto, âMove fast and break things,â which celebrated the idea that it was better to be flawed and first than careful and perfect. Andrew Bosworth, a former Harvard teaching assistant who is now one of Zuckerbergâs longest-serving lieutenants and a member of his inner circle, explained, âA failure can be a form of success. Itâs not the form you want, but it can be a useful thing to how you learn.â In Zuckerbergâs view, skeptics were often just fogies and scolds. âThereâs always someone who wants to slow you down,â he said in a commencement address at Harvard last year. âIn our society, we often donât do big things because weâre so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing. The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that canât keep us from starting.â\n\nZuckerbergâs disregard for criticism entered a more emphatic phase in 2010, with the release of the movie â[The Social Network](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/influencing-people),â an account of Facebookâs early years, written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher. Some of the film was fictionalized. It presented Zuckerbergâs motivation largely as a desire to meet girls, even though, in real life, he was dating Priscilla Chan for most of the time period covered in the movie. But other elements cut close to the truth, including the depiction of his juvenile bravado and the early feuds over ownership. Zuckerberg and Facebook had chosen not to be involved in the production, and the portrayal was unflattering. Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is cocksure and cold, and the real Zuckerberg found the depiction hurtful. âFirst impressions matter a lot, and for a lot of people that was their introduction to me,â he told me. âMy reaction to this, to all these things, is primarily that I perceive it through the employees.â His concern was less about how people would think of him, he said, than about âhow is our company, how are our employeesâthese people I work with and care so much aboutâhow are they going to process this?â\n\nBefore the movie came out, Facebook executives debated how to respond. Zuckerberg settled on a stance of effortful good cheer, renting a movie theatre to screen it for the staff. Eight years later, Facebook executives still mention what they call, resentfully, âthe movie.â Sandberg, who is the companyâs second most important public figure, and one of Zuckerbergâs most ardent defenders, told me, âFrom its facts to its essence to its portrayal, I think that was a very unfair picture. I still think it forms the basis of a lot of what people believe about Mark.â\n\nWhile the movie contributed to the fortress mentality on campus, Zuckerberg made a series of decisions that solidified his confidence in his instincts. In 2012, he paid a billion dollars for [Instagram](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/instagram), the photo-sharing service, which at the time had only thirteen employees. Outside the industry, the startup appeared wildly overpriced, but it proved to be one of the best investments in the history of the Internet. (Today, Instagram is valued at more than a hundred times what Zuckerberg paid for it, and, even more important, it is popular with young people, a cohort that shows declining interest in Facebook.) That spring, Facebook went public on the Nasdaq, at a valuation of a hundred and four billion dollars. There were technical glitches on the day of the listing, and many people doubted that the company could earn enough money to justify the valuation. The share price promptly sank. The _Wall Street Journal_ called the I.P.O. a â[fiasco](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577436873952633672),â and shareholders sued Facebook and Zuckerberg. âWe got a ton of criticism,â he recalled. âOur market cap got cut in half. But what I felt was, we were at a sufficient skill and complexity that it was going to take a couple years to work through the problem, but I had strong conviction that we were doing the right thing.â (Even with its recent plunge, the value of Facebook stock has more than quadrupled in the years since.)\n\nZuckerberg was happy to make sharp turns to achieve his aims. In 2011, when users started moving from desktop computers to phones, Facebook swerved toward mobile technology. Zuckerberg told employees that he would kick them out of his office if their ideas did not account for the transition. âWithin a month, you literally canât meet with Mark if youâre not bringing him a mobile product,â Bosworth recalled.\n\nIn 2014, as problems accumulated, Facebook changed its motto, âMove fast and break things,â to the decidedly less glamorous âMove fast with stable infrastructure.â Still, internally, much of the original spirit endured, and the push for haste began to take a toll in the offline world. In early 2016, Zuckerberg directed employees to accelerate the release of Facebook Live, a video-streaming service, and expanded its team of engineers from twelve to more than a hundred. When the product emerged, two months later, so did unforeseen issues: the service let users flag videos as inappropriate, but it didnât give them a way to indicate where in a broadcast the problem appeared. As a result, Facebook Live videos of people committing suicide, or engaged in criminal activity, started circulating before reviewers had time to race through, find the issues, and take the videos down. A few months after the service launched, a Chicago man named Antonio Perkins was fatally shot on Facebook Live and the video was viewed hundreds of thousands of times.\n\nThe incident might have served as a warning to slow down, but, instead, the next day, Bosworth sent around a remarkable internal memo justifying some of Facebookâs âuglyâ physical and social effects as the trade-offs necessary for growth: âMaybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is \\*de facto\\* good.â\n\nThis spring, after the memo [leaked to BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data), Bosworth said that he had been playing devilâs advocate, and Zuckerberg issued a statement: âBoz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. Weâve never believed the ends justify the means.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nZuckerberg was also experimenting with [philanthropy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/gospels-of-giving-for-the-new-gilded-age). In 2010, shortly before the release of âThe Social Network,â he made a high-profile gift. Appearing onstage at âThe Oprah Winfrey Show,â along with Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, and Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, he announced a hundred-million-dollar donation to help Newarkâs struggling public-school system. [The project](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled) quickly encountered opposition from local groups that saw it as out of touch, and, eight years later, itâs generally considered a failure. In May, Ras Baraka, Newarkâs mayor, said of the donation, âYou canât just cobble up a bunch of money and drop it in the middle of the street and say, âThis is going to fix everything.â&#160;â\n\nFor all the criticism, the project has produced some measurable improvements. A Harvard study found greater gains in English than the state average, and a study by MarGrady Research, an education-policy group, found that high-school graduation rates and over-all student enrollment in Newark have risen since the donation. Zuckerberg emphasizes those results, even as he acknowledges flaws in his approach. âYour earning potential is dramatically higher if you graduate from high school versus not. That part of it, I think, is the part that worked and it was effective,â he said. âThere were a bunch of other things that we tried that either were much harder than we thought or just didnât work.â Strategies that helped him in business turned out to hurt him in education reform. âI think in a lot of philanthropy and government-related work, if you try five things and a few of them fail, then the ones that fail are going to get a lot of the attention,â he said.\n\nIn 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan pledged to spend ninety-nine per cent of their Facebook fortune âto advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation.â They created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited-liability company that gives to charity, invests in for-profit companies, and engages in political advocacy. David Plouffe said that the lessons of the Newark investment shaped the initiativeâs perspective. âI think the lesson was, you have to do this in full partnership with the community, not just the leaders,â he said. âYou need to have enthusiastic buy-in from superintendents, and teachers, and parents.â\n\nIn contrast to a traditional foundation, an L.L.C. can lobby and give money to politicians, without as strict a legal requirement to disclose activities. In other words, rather than trying to win over politicians and citizens in places like Newark, Zuckerberg and Chan could help elect politicians who agree with them, and rally the public directly by running ads and supporting advocacy groups. (A spokesperson for C.Z.I. said that it has given no money to candidates; it has supported ballot initiatives through a 501(c)(4) social-welfare organization.) âThe whole point of the L.L.C. structure is to allow a coÃ¶rdinated attack,â Rob Reich, a co-director of Stanfordâs Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, told me. The structure has gained popularity in Silicon Valley but has been criticized for allowing wealthy individuals to orchestrate large-scale social agendas behind closed doors. Reich said, âThere should be much greater transparency, so that itâs not dark. Thatâs not a criticism of Mark Zuckerberg. Itâs a criticism of the law.â\n\nIn 2016, Zuckerberg announced, onstage and in a Facebook post, his intention to âhelp cure all disease in our childrenâs lifetime.â That was partly bluster: C.Z.I. is working on a slightly more realistic agenda, to âcure, prevent or manage all diseases.â The theatrics irritated some in the philanthropy world who thought that Zuckerbergâs presentation minimized the challenges, but, in general, scientists have applauded the ambition. When I asked Zuckerberg about the reception of the project, he said, âItâs funny, when I talk to people here in the Valley, you get a couple of reactions. A bunch of people have the reaction of âOh, thatâs obviously going to happen on its ownâwhy donât you just spend your time doing something else?â And then a bunch of people have the reaction of âOh, that seems almost impossibleâwhy are you setting your sights so high?â&#160;â\n\nCharacteristically, Zuckerberg favors the optimistic scenario. âOn average, every year for the last eighty years or so, I think, life expectancy has gone up by about a quarter of a year. And, if you believe that technological and scientific progress is not going to slow, there is a potential upside to speeding that up,â he said. âWeâre going to get to a point where the life expectancy implied by extrapolating that out will mean that weâll basically have been able to manage or cure all of the major things that people suffer from and die from today. Based on the data that we already see, it seems like thereâs a reasonable shot.â\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3ce01fe0d4c650956c9]||||||\n+++\n\nI asked Bill Gates, whose private foundation is the largest in the U.S., about Zuckerbergâs objectives. âThere are aspirations and then there are plans,â he said. âAnd plans vary in terms of their degree of realism and concreteness.â He added that Zuckerbergâs long-range goal is âvery safe, because you will not be around to write the article saying that he overcommitted.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook expanded, so did its blind spots. The companyâs financial future relies partly on growth in developing countries, but the platform has been a powerful catalyst of violence in fragile parts of the globe. In India, the largest market for Facebookâs WhatsApp service, hoaxes have triggered riots, lynchings, and fatal beatings. Local officials resorted to shutting down the Internet sixty-five times last year. In Libya, people took to Facebook to trade weapons, and armed groups relayed the locations of targets for artillery strikes. In Sri Lanka, after a Buddhist mob attacked Muslims this spring over a false rumor, a Presidential adviser told the _[Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html)_, âThe germs are ours, but Facebook is the wind.â\n\nNowhere has the damage been starker than in [Myanmar](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Myanmar), where the Rohingya Muslim minority has been subject to brutal killings, gang rapes, and torture. In 2012, around one per cent of the countryâs population had access to the Internet. Three years later, that figure had reached twenty-five per cent. Phones often came preloaded with the Facebook app, and Buddhist extremists seeking to inflame ethnic tensions with the Rohingya mastered the art of misinformation. Wirathu, a monk with a large Facebook following, sparked a deadly riot against Muslims in 2014 when he shared a fake report of a rape and warned of a âJihad against us.â Others gamed Facebookâs rules against hate speech by fanning paranoia about demographic change. Although Muslims make up no more than five per cent of the country, a popular graphic appearing on Facebook cautioned that âwhen Muslims become the most powerfulâ they will offer âIslam or the sword.â\n\nBeginning in 2013, a series of experts on Myanmar met with Facebook officials to warn them that it was fuelling attacks on the Rohingya. David Madden, an entrepreneur based in Myanmar, delivered a presentation to officials at the Menlo Park headquarters, pointing out that the company was playing a role akin to that of the radio broadcasts that spread hatred during the Rwandan genocide. In 2016, C4ADS, a Washington-based nonprofit, published a detailed analysis of Facebook usage in Myanmar, and described a âcampaign of hate speech that actively dehumanizes Muslims.â Facebook officials said that they were hiring more Burmese-language reviewers to take down dangerous content, but the company repeatedly declined to say how many had actually been hired. By last March, the situation had become dire: almost a million Rohingya had fled the country, and more than a hundred thousand were confined to internal camps. The United Nations investigator in charge of examining the crisis, which the U.N. has deemed a genocide, said, âIâm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it was originally intended.â Afterward, when pressed, Zuckerberg repeated the claim that Facebook was âhiring dozensâ of additional Burmese-language content reviewers.\n\nMore than three months later, I asked Jes Kaliebe Petersen, the C.E.O. of Phandeeyar, a tech hub in Myanmar, if there had been any progress. âWe havenât seen any tangible change from Facebook,â he told me. âWe donât know how much content is being reported. We donât know how many people at Facebook speak Burmese. The situation is getting worse and worse here.â\n\nI saw Zuckerberg the following morning, and asked him what was taking so long. He replied, âI think, fundamentally, weâve been slow at the same thing in a number of areas, because itâs actually the same problem. But, yeah, I think the situation in Myanmar is terrible.â It was a frustrating and evasive reply. I asked him to specify the problem. He said, âAcross the board, the solution to this is we need to move from what is fundamentally a reactive model to a model where we are using technical systems to flag things to a much larger number of people who speak all the native languages around the world and who can just capture much more of the content.â\n\nI told him that people in Myanmar are incredulous that a company with Facebookâs resources has failed to heed their complaints. âWeâre taking this seriously,â he said. âYou canât just snap your fingers and solve these problems. It takes time to hire the people and train them, and to build the systems that can flag stuff for them.â He promised that Facebook would have âa hundred or more Burmese-speaking people by the end of the year,â and added, âI hate that weâre in this position where we are not moving as quickly as we would like.â A few weeks after our conversation, Facebook announced that it was banning Myanmarâs Army chief and several other military officials.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg had come to see his ability to reject complaints as a virtue. But, by 2016, that stance had primed the company for a crisis. Tristan Harris, the design ethicist, said, âWhen youâre running anything like Facebook, you get criticized all the time, and you just stop paying attention to criticism if a lot of it is not well founded. You learn to treat it as naÃ¯ve and uninformed.â He went on, âThe problem is it also puts you out of touch with genuine criticism from people who actually understand the issues.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe 2016 election was supposed to be good for Facebook. That January, Sheryl Sandberg told investors that the election would be âa big deal in terms of ad spend,â comparable to the Super Bowl and the World Cup. According to Borrell Associates, a research and consulting firm, candidates and other political groups were on track to spend $1.4 billion online in the election, up ninefold from four years earlier.\n\nFacebook offered to âembedâ employees, for free, in Presidential campaign offices to help them use the platform effectively. Clintonâs campaign said no. Trumpâs said yes, and Facebook employees helped his campaign craft messages. Although Trumpâs language was openly hostile to ethnic minorities, inside Facebook his behavior felt, to some executives, like just part of the distant cesspool of Washington. Americans always seemed to be choosing between a hated Republican and a hated Democrat, and Trumpâs descriptions of Mexicans as rapists was simply an extension of that.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump used Facebook to raise two hundred and eighty million dollars. Just days before the election, his team paid for a voter-suppression effort on the platform. According to _Bloomberg Businessweek_, it targeted three Democratic constituenciesââidealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americansââsending them videos precisely tailored to discourage them from turning out for Clinton. Theresa Hong, the Trump campaignâs digital-content director, later told an interviewer, âWithout Facebook we wouldnât have won.â\n\nAfter the election, Facebook executives fretted that the company would be blamed for the spread of fake news. Zuckerbergâs staff gave him statistics showing that the vast majority of election information on the platform was legitimate. At a tech conference a few days later, Zuckerberg was defensive. âThe idea that fake news on Facebookâof which, you know, itâs a very small amount of the contentâinfluenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,â he said. To some at Facebook, Zuckerbergâs defensiveness was alarming. A former executive told [_Wired_,](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/) âWe had to really flip him on that. We realized that if we didnât, the company was going to start heading down this pariah path.â\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about his âpretty crazyâ comment, he said that he was wrong to have been âglib.â He told me, âNobody wants any amount of fake news. It is an issue on an ongoing basis, and we need to take that seriously.â But he still bristles at the implication that Facebook may have distorted voter behavior. âI find the notion that people would only vote some way because they were tricked to be almost viscerally offensive,â he said. âBecause it goes against the whole notion that you should trust people and that individuals are smart and can understand their own experience and can make their own assessments about what direction they want their community to go in.â\n\nShortly after the election, Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, contacted Facebook to discuss Russian interference. âThe initial reaction was completely dismissive,â he told me. But, by the spring, he sensed that the company was realizing that it had a serious problem. âThey were seeing an enormous amount of Russian activity in the French elections,â Warner said. âIt was getting better, but I still donât think they were putting nearly enough resources behind this.â Warner, who made a fortune in the telecom business, added, âMost of the companies in the Valley think that policymakers, one, donât get it, and, two, that ultimately, if they just stonewall us, then weâll go away.â\n\nFacebook moved fitfully to acknowledge the role it had played in the election. In September of 2017, after Robert Mueller obtained a search warrant, Facebook agreed to give his office an inventory of ads linked to Russia and the details of who had paid for them. In October, Facebook disclosed that Russian operatives had published about eighty thousand posts, reaching a hundred and twenty-six million Americans.\n\nIn March, after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, Zuckerberg and Facebook were paralyzed. For five days, Zuckerberg said nothing. His personal Facebook profile offered no statements or analysis. Its most recent post was a photo of him and Chan baking hamantaschen for Purim.\n\nâI feel like weâve let people down and that feels terrible,â he told me later. âBut it goes back to this notion that we shouldnât be making the same mistake multiple times.â He insists that fake news is less common than people imagine: âThe average person might perceive, from how much we and others talk about it, that there is more than ten times as much misinformation or hoax content on Facebook than the academic measures that weâve seen so far suggest.â He is still not convinced that the spread of misinformation had an impact on the election. âI actually donât consider that a closed thing,â he said. âI still think thatâs the kind of thing that needs to be studied.â\n\nIn conversation, Zuckerberg is, unsurprisingly, highly analytical. When he encounters a theory that doesnât accord with his own, he finds a seam of disagreementâa fact, a methodology, a premiseâand hammers at it. Itâs an effective technique for winning arguments, but one that makes it difficult to introduce new information. Over time, some former colleagues say, his deputies have begun to filter out bad news from presentations before it reaches him. A former Facebook official told me, âThey only want to hear good news. They donât want people who are disagreeing with them. There is a culture of âYou go along to get along.â&#160;â\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfbc66792cd5fab4be]||||||\n+++\n\nI once asked Zuckerberg what he reads to get the news. âI probably mostly read aggregators,â he said. âI definitely follow Techmemeââa roundup of headlines about his industryââand the media and political equivalents of that, just for awareness.â He went on, âThereâs really no newspaper that I pick up and read front to back. Well, that might be true of most people these daysâmost people donât read the physical paperâbut there arenât many news Web sites where I go to browse.â\n\nA couple of days later, he called me and asked to revisit the subject. âI felt like my answers were kind of vague, because I didnât necessarily feel like it was appropriate for me to get into which specific organizations or reporters I read and follow,â he said. âI guess what I tried to convey, although Iâm not sure if this came across clearly, is that the job of uncovering new facts and doing it in a trusted way is just an absolutely critical function for society.â\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg have attributed their mistakes to excessive optimism, a blindness to the darker applications of their service. But that explanation ignores their fixation on growth, and their unwillingness to heed warnings. Zuckerberg resisted calls to reorganize the company around a new understanding of privacy, or to reconsider the depth of data it collects for advertisers.\n\nJamesÂ P. Steyer, the founder and C.E.O. of Common Sense Media, an organization that promotes safety in technology and media for children, visited Facebookâs headquarters in the spring of 2018 to discuss his concerns about a product called Messenger Kids, which allows children under thirteenâthe minimum age to use the primary Facebook appâto make video calls and send messages to contacts that a parent approves. He met with Sandberg and Elliot Schrage, at the time the head of policy and communications. âI respect their business success, and like Sheryl personally, and I was hoping they might finally consider taking steps to better protect kids. Instead, they said that the best thing for young kids was to spend more time on Messenger Kids,â Steyer told me. âThey still seemed to be in denial. Would _you_ âmove fast and break thingsâ when it comes to children? To our democracy? No, because you can damage them forever.â\n\nTo some people in the company, the executives seemed concentrated not on solving the problems or on preventing the next ones but on containing the damage. Tavis McGinn, a former Google pollster, started working at Facebook in the spring of 2017, doing polls with a narrow focus: measuring the public perception of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. During the next six months, McGinn conducted eight surveys and four focus groups in three countries, collecting the kinds of measurements favored by politicians and advertisers. Facebook polled reactions to the companyâs new stated mission to âbring the world closer together,â as well as to items on Zuckerbergâs social-media feed, including his writings, photographs, and even his casual banter during a back-yard barbecue broadcast on Facebook Live.\n\nIn September, McGinn resigned. In an interview, he told the Web site the Verge that he had become discouraged. âI was not going to be able to change the way that the company does business,â he said. âI couldnât change the values. I couldnât change the culture.â He concluded that measuring the âtrue social outcomesâ of Facebook was of limited interest to senior staffers. âI think research can be very powerful, if people are willing to listen,â he said. âBut I decided after six months that it was a waste of my time to be there. I didnât feel great about the product. I didnât feel proud to tell people I worked at Facebook. I didnât feel I was helping the world.â (McGinn, who has signed a nondisclosure agreement with Facebook, declined to comment for this article.)\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn March, Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress for the first time about Facebookâs handling of user data. The hearing was scheduled for April. As the date approached, the hearing acquired the overtones of a trial.\n\nIn barely two years, the mood in Washington had shifted. Internet companies and entrepreneurs, formerly valorized as the vanguard of American ingenuity and the astronauts of our time, were being compared to Standard Oil and other monopolists of the Gilded Age. This spring, the _Wall Street Journal_ published [an article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-titans-tiptoe-toward-monopoly-1527783845) that began, âImagine a not-too-distant future in which trustbusters force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.â It was accompanied by a sepia-toned illustration in which portraits of Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and other tech C.E.O.s had been grafted onto overstuffed torsos meant to evoke the robber barons. In 1915, Louis Brandeis, the reformer and future Supreme Court Justice, testified before a congressional committee about the dangers of corporations large enough that they could achieve a level of near-sovereignty âso powerful that the ordinary social and industrial forces existing are insufficient to cope with it.â He called this the âcurse of bigness.â Tim Wu, a Columbia law-school professor and the author of a forthcoming book inspired by Brandeisâs phrase, told me, âToday, no sector exemplifies more clearly the threat of bigness to democracy than Big Tech.â He added, âWhen a concentrated private power has such control over what we see and hear, it has a power that rivals or exceeds that of elected government.â\n\nShortly before Zuckerberg was due to testify, a team from the Washington law firm of WilmerHale flew to Menlo Park to run him through mock hearings and to coach him on the requisite gestures of humility. Even before the recent scandals, Bill Gates had advised Zuckerberg to be alert to the opinions of lawmakers, a lesson that Gates had learned in 1998, when Microsoft faced accusations of monopolistic behavior. Gates testified to Congress, defiantly, that âthe computer-software industry is not broken, and there is no need to fix it.â Within months, the Department of Justice sued Microsoft for violating federal antitrust law, leading to three years of legal agony before a settlement was reached. Gates told me that he regretted âtauntingâ regulators, saying, âNot something I would choose to repeat.â He encouraged Zuckerberg to be attentive to D.C. âI said, âGet an office thereânow.â And Mark did, and he owes me,â Gates said. Last year, Facebook spent $11.5 million on lobbying in Washington, ranking it between the American Bankers Association and General Dynamics among top spenders.\n\nOn April 10th, when Zuckerberg arrived at the [Senate hearing](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/what-was-missing-from-mark-zuckerbergs-first-day-of-congressional-testimony), he wore a sombre blue suit, and took a seat before more than forty senators. In front of him, his notes outlined likely questions and answers, including the prospect that a senator might ask him to step down from the company. His answer, in shorthand, would be: âFounded Facebook. My decisions. I made mistakes. Big challenge, but weâve solved problems before, going to solve this one. Already taking action.â\n\nAs it turned out, nobody asked him to resignâor much of anything difficult. Despite scattered moments of pressure, the overwhelming impression left by the event was how poorly some senators grasped the issues. In the most revealing moment, Orrin Hatch, the eighty-four-year-old Republican from Utah, demanded to know how Facebook makes money if âusers donât pay for your service.â Zuckerberg replied, âSenator, we run ads,â allowing a small smile.\n\nTo observers inclined to distrust Zuckerberg, he was evasive to the point of amnesiacâhe said, more than forty times, that he would need to follow upâbut when the hearing concluded, after five hours, he had emerged unscathed, and Wall Street, watching closely, rewarded him by boosting the value of Facebookâs stock by twenty billion dollars. A few days later, on the internal Facebook message board, an employee wrote that he planned to buy T-shirts reading âSenator, we run ads.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg whether policymakers might try to break up Facebook, he replied, adamantly, that such a move would be a mistake. The field is âextremely competitive,â he told me. âI think sometimes people get into this mode of âWell, thereâs not, like, an exact replacement for Facebook.â Well, actually, that makes it _more_ competitive, because what we really are is a system of different things: we compete with Twitter as a broadcast medium; we compete with Snapchat as a broadcast medium; we do messaging, and iMessage is default-installed on every iPhone.â He acknowledged the deeper concern. âThereâs this other question, which is just, laws aside, how do we feel about these tech companies being big?â he said. But he argued that efforts to âcurtailâ the growth of Facebook or other Silicon Valley heavyweights would cede the field to China. âI think that anything that weâre doing to constrain them will, first, have an impact on how successful we can be in other places,â he said. âI wouldnât worry in the near term about Chinese companies or anyone else winning in the U.S., for the most part. But there are all these places where there are day-to-day more competitive situationsâin Southeast Asia, across Europe, Latin America, lots of different places.â\n\nThe rough consensus in Washington is that regulators are unlikely to try to break up Facebook. The F.T.C. will almost certainly fine the company for violations, and may consider blocking it from buying big potential competitors, but, as a former F.T.C. commissioner told me, âin the United States youâre allowed to have a monopoly position, as long as you achieve it and maintain it without doing illegal things.â\n\nFacebook is encountering tougher treatment in Europe, where antitrust laws are stronger and the history of fascism makes people especially wary of intrusions on privacy. One of the most formidable critics of Silicon Valley is the [European Union](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/european-union)âs top antitrust regulator, Margrethe Vestager. Last year, after an investigation of Googleâs search engine, Vestager accused the company of giving an âillegal advantageâ to its shopping service and fined it $2.7 billion, at that time the largest fine ever imposed by the E.U. in an antitrust case. In July, she added another five-billion-dollar fine for the companyâs practice of requiring device makers to preinstall Google apps.\n\nIn Brussels, Vestager is a high-profile presenceânearly six feet tall, with short black-and-silver hair. She grew up in rural Denmark, the eldest child of two Lutheran pastors, and, when I spoke to her recently, she talked about her enforcement powers in philosophical terms. âWhat weâre dealing with, when people start doing something illegal, is exactly as old as Adam and Eve,â she said. âHuman decisions very often are guided by greed, by fear of being pushed out of the marketplace, or of losing something thatâs important to you. And then, if you throw power into that cocktail of greed and fear, you have something that you can recognize throughout time.â\n\nVestager told me that her office has no open cases involving Facebook, but she expressed concern that the company was taking advantage of users, beginning with terms of service that she calls âunbalanced.â She paraphrased those terms as âItâs your data, but you give us a royalty-free global license to do, basically, whatever we want.â Imagine, she said, if a brick-and-mortar business asked to copy all your photographs for its unlimited, unspecified uses. âYour children, from the very first day until the confirmation, the rehearsal dinner for the wedding, the wedding itself, the first child being baptized. You would never accept that,â she said. âBut this is what you accept without a blink of an eye when itâs digital.â\n\nIn Vestagerâs view, a healthy market should produce competitors to Facebook that position themselves as ethical alternatives, collecting less data and seeking a smaller share of user attention. âWe need social media that will allow us to have a nonaddictive, advertising-free space,â she said. âYouâre more than welcome to be successful and to dramatically outgrow your competitors if customers like your product. But, if you grow to be dominant, you have a special responsibility not to misuse your dominant position to make it very difficult for others to compete against you and to attract potential customers. Of course, we keep an eye on it. If we get worried, we will start looking.â\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab503]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs the pressure on Facebook has intensified, the company has been moving to fix its vulnerabilities. In December, after Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya spoke publicly about the damaging psychological effects of social media, Facebook acknowledged evidence that heavy use can exacerbate anxiety and loneliness. After years of perfecting addictive features, such as âauto-playâ videos, it announced a new direction: it would promote the quality, rather than the quantity, of time spent on the site. The company modified its algorithm to emphasize updates from friends and family, the kind of content most likely to promote âactive engagement.â In a post, Zuckerberg wrote, âWe can help make sure that Facebook is time well spent.â\n\nThe company also grappled with the possibility that it would once again become a vehicle for election-season propaganda. In 2018, hundreds of millions of people would be voting in elections around the world, including in the U.S. midterms. After years of lobbying against requirements to disclose the sources of funding for political ads, the company announced that users would now be able to look up who paid for a political ad, whom the ad targeted, and which other ads the funders had run.\n\nSamidh Chakrabarti, the product manager in charge of Facebookâs âelection integrityâ work, told me that the revelations about Russiaâs Internet Research Agency were deeply alarming. âThis wasnât the kind of product that any of us thought that we were working on,â he said. With the midterms approaching, the company had discovered that Russiaâs model for exploiting Facebook had inspired a generation of new actors similarly focussed on skewing political debate. âThere are lots of copycats,â Chakrabarti said.\n\nZuckerberg used to rave about the virtues of âfrictionless sharing,â but these days Facebook is working on âimposing frictionâ to slow the spread of disinformation. In January, the company hired Nathaniel Gleicher, the former director for cybersecurity policy on President Obamaâs National Security Council, to blunt âinformation operations.â In July, it removed thirty-two accounts running disinformation campaigns that were traced to Russia. A few weeks later, it removed more than six hundred and fifty accounts, groups, and pages with links to Russia or Iran. Depending on your point of view, the removals were a sign either of progress or of the growing scale of the problem. Regardless, they highlighted the astonishing degree to which the security of elections around the world now rests in the hands of Gleicher, Chakrabarti, and other employees at Facebook.\n\nAs hard as it is to curb election propaganda, Zuckerbergâs most intractable problem may lie elsewhereâin the struggle over which opinions can appear on Facebook, which cannot, and who gets to decide. As an engineer, Zuckerberg never wanted to wade into the realm of content. Initially, Facebook tried blocking certain kinds of material, such as posts featuring nudity, but it was forced to create long lists of exceptions, including images of breast-feeding, âacts of protest,â and works of art. Once Facebook became a venue for political debate, the problem exploded. In April, in a call with investment analysts, Zuckerberg said glumly that it was proving âeasier to build an A.I. system to detect a nipple than what is hate speech.â\n\nThe cult of growth leads to the curse of bigness: every day, a billion things were being posted to Facebook. At any given moment, a Facebook âcontent moderatorâ was deciding whether a post in, say, Sri Lanka met the standard of hate speech or whether a dispute over Korean politics had crossed the line into bullying. Zuckerberg sought to avoid banning users, preferring to be a âplatform for all ideas.â But he needed to prevent Facebook from becoming a swamp of hoaxes and abuse. His solution was to ban âhate speechâ and impose lesser punishments for âmisinformation,â a broad category that ranged from crude deceptions to simple mistakes. Facebook tried to develop rules about how the punishments would be applied, but each idiosyncratic scenario prompted more rules, and over time they became byzantine. According to Facebook training slides published by the _Guardian_ last year, moderators were told that it was permissible to say âYou are such a Jewâ but not permissible to say âIrish are the best, but really French sucks,â because the latter was defining another people as âinferiors.â Users could not write âMigrants are scum,â because it is dehumanizing, but they could write âKeep the horny migrant teen-agers away from our daughters.â The distinctions were explained to trainees in arcane formulas such as âNot ProtectedÂ +Â Quasi protectedÂ =Â not protected.â\n\nIn July, the issue landed, inescapably, in Zuckerbergâs lap. For years, Facebook had provided a platform to the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose delusions include that the parents of children killed in the [Sandy Hook school massacre](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/newtown-shooting) are paid actors with an anti-gun agenda. Facebook was loath to ban Jones. When people complained that his rants violated rules against harassment and fake news, Facebook experimented with punishments. At first, it âreducedâ him, tweaking the algorithm so that his messages would be shown to fewer people, while feeding his fans articles that fact-checked his assertions.\n\nThen, in late July, Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, the parents of Noah Pozner, a child killed at Sandy Hook, published an open letter addressed âDear Mr Zuckerberg,â in which they described âliving in hidingâ because of death threats from conspiracy theorists, after âan almost inconceivable battle with Facebook to provide us with the most basic of protections.â In their view, Zuckerberg had âdeemed that the attacks on us are immaterial, that providing assistance in removing threats is too cumbersome, and that our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate.â\n\nFacebook relented, somewhat. On July 27th, it took down four of Jonesâs videos and suspended him for a month. But public pressure did not let up. On August 5th, the dam broke after Apple, saying that the company âdoes not tolerate hate speech,â stopped distributing five podcasts associated with Jones. Facebook shut down four of Jonesâs pages for ârepeatedlyâ violating rules against hate speech and bullying. I asked Zuckerberg why Facebook had wavered in its handling of the situation. He was prickly about the suggestion: âI donât believe that it is the right thing to ban a person for saying something that is factually incorrect.â\n\nJones seemed a lot more than factually incorrect, I said.\n\nâO.K., but I think the facts here are pretty clear,â he said, homing in. âThe _initial_ questions were around misinformation.â He added, âWe donât take it down and ban people unless itâs directly inciting violence.â He told me that, after Jones was reduced, more complaints about him flooded in, alerting Facebook to older posts, and that the company was debating what to do when Apple announced its ban. Zuckerberg said, âWhen they moved, it was, like, O.K., we shouldnât just be sitting on this content and these enforcement decisions. We should move on what we know violates the policy. We need to make a decision now.â\n\nIt will hardly be the last quandary of this sort. Facebookâs free-speech dilemmas have no simple answersâyou donât have to be a fan of Alex Jones to be unnerved by the companyâs extraordinary power to silence a voice when it chooses, or, for that matter, to amplify others, to pull the levers of what we see, hear, and experience. Zuckerberg is hoping to erect a scalable system, an orderly decision tree that accounts for every eventuality and exception, but the boundaries of speech are a bedevilling problem that defies mechanistic fixes. The Supreme Court, defining obscenity, landed on âI know it when I see it.â For now, Facebook is making do with a Rube Goldberg machine of policies and improvisations, and opportunists are relishing it. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, seized on the ban of Jones as a fascist assault on conservatives. In a moment that was rich even by Cruzâs standards, he quoted Martin NiemÃ¶llerâs famous lines about the Holocaust, saying, âAs the poem goes, you know, âFirst they came for Alex Jones.â&#160;â\n\nLast week, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sandberg said, âWe now have over twenty thousand people and we are able to review reports in fifty languages, twenty-four hours a day.â (In the hallway before the session, as if to underscore the complexities ahead, Alex Jones had made a scene, heckling Senator Marco Rubio for not doing more to get him back on Facebook.) In recent years, Sandberg has gained fame for her work outside the company, including her books, âLean In,â a best-seller on womenâs empowerment, and âOption B,â which she wrote after the sudden death of her husband, Dave Goldberg. But her responsibility for the Facebook fallout is likely to grow, and her reputation as C.O.O. hinges on the implementation of changes. Many people in Silicon Valley believe that Sandberg and Facebookâs board of directors must do more to prevent the company from making another major mistake. âI know a couple of guys who are color-blind,â a prominent executive told me, âand their wives lay their clothes out for them in the morning if they donât want to go out every day looking like Bozo the Clown. Sheryl and the board are expected to lay the clothes out for Mark.â He went on, âIf you have blind spots, then you rely on the people around you to tell you where they are.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn one of our conversations, I asked Zuckerberg whether he finds it insulting when people speculate that he lacks emotions. âInsulting?â he asked, and then paused for several seconds to consider. âI donât find it insulting. I donât think itâs _accurate_. I mean, I definitely care a lot. Thereâs a difference between letting emotions drive impulsive decisions and caring.â He went on, âUltimately, I think the reason that we built this successful thing is because we just solve problem after problem after problem, and typically you donât do that by making impulsive, emotional decisions.â\n\nThe caricature of Zuckerberg is that of an automaton with little regard for the human dimensions of his work. The truth is something else: he decided long ago that no historical change is painless. Like Augustus, he is at peace with his trade-offs. Between speech and truth, he chose speech. Between speed and perfection, he chose speed. Between scale and safety, he chose scale. His life thus far has convinced him that he can solve âproblem after problem after problem,â no matter the howling from the public it may cause.\n\nAt a certain point, the habits of mind that served Zuckerberg well on his ascent will start to work against him. To avoid further crises, he will have to embrace the fact that heâs now a protector of the peace, not a disrupter of it. Facebookâs colossal power of persuasion has delivered fortune but also peril. Like it or not, Zuckerberg is a gatekeeper. The era when Facebook could learn by doing, and fix the mistakes later, is over. The costs are too high, and idealism is not a defense against negligence.\n\nIn some sense, the âMark Zuckerberg productionââas he called Facebook in its early yearsâhas only just begun. Zuckerberg is not yet thirty-five, and the ambition with which he built his empire could well be directed toward shoring up his company, his country, and his name. The question is not whether Zuckerberg has the power to fix Facebook but whether he has the will; whether he will kick people out of his officeâwith the gusto that he once mustered for the pivot to mobileâif they donât bring him ideas for preventing violence in Myanmar, or protecting privacy, or mitigating the toxicity of social media. He succeeded, long ago, in making Facebook great. The challenge before him now is to make it good.Â â¦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02cf1c7a8e33fb390be6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Evan Osnos joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2008 and covers politics and foreign affairs.

Who, that is, besides Facebook executives and their lawyers? Until a little over a week ago, the company had successfully sequestered internal e-mails, which were obtained by the legal team of Ted Kramer, the founder of the app company Six4Three, during the discovery process in a 2015 lawsuit. At issue was Facebookâs policy of allowing third-party app developers to access the data of Facebook usersâ friendsâthe very policy that enabled [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cambridge-analytica) to buy the data of eighty-seven million unwitting users on behalf of the Trump campaign. In Kramerâs case, his Pikinis app relied on that access; once Facebook changed its policy, in 2014, the app no longer worked. Kramer cried foul and sued Facebook for breach of contract. At the companyâs request, the judge in the case ordered the records sealed to keep them, ironically, private.\n\nThat changed on November 20th, when a parliamentary sergeant-at-arms showed up at Kramerâs London hotel room and escorted him to the halls of Westminster, where the Tory M.P. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, demanded that Kramer turn over all his files in the case under threat of arrest. Kramer, who was in London on unrelated business, said that he panicked and moved a number of files from a Dropbox account to a USB drive, which he turned over to the M.P. How Collins knew that Kramer was in London has been traced to the tireless *Guardian* reporter Carole Cadwalladr, who has spent more than two years unravelling the connections between Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), [Steve Bannon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon), Robert Mercer, and [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit). After arranging to meet with Kramer, she appears to have [tipped](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/six4three-kramer-collins-facebook) off Collins to Kramerâs whereabouts. But how Collins knew that Kramer was in possession of the documentsâwhich were not his to haveâremains a mystery. There are reports that the two men had been in communication for the past few months, at Cadwalladrâs prompting, which suggests that the frog march to Parliament was just for show. (When Kramerâs lawyers found out that he was in possession of the discovery documents and that he had given them to Collins, they attempted to drop him, but, over the weekend, a California judge [demanded](http://fortune.com/2018/12/01/facebook-leak-six4three/) that they continue to represent Kramer until the matter of the purloined files is adjudicated.) \n\nCollins, for his part, claimed that whatever seal was in force in California was irrelevant in the U.K. On November 27th, he used the snatched e-mails to grill Richard Allan, the Facebook executive who was sent to speak for the company at an unprecedented international hearing on fake news and disinformation that Collins convened in Parliament. [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg), who said he was too busy to appearâmaking this the fourth time that he has refused a request from Parliamentâwas represented by a nameplate positioned in front of an empty chair; every time the television cameras panned to Allan, they also showed his absent boss. Allan admitted that the optics were ânot great,â and then went on to do his best Zuckerberg imitation, dodging and feinting as the lawmakers sought to put him on the spot. The most damning [claim](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-considered-charging-for-access-to-user-data-1543454648) to emerge was that Facebook either gave, or considered giving, favored access to its usersâ data to companies that spent at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in advertising on the platform. There also seemed to be [evidence](https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/a3mkxe/facebook-was-aware-of-russian-meddling-as-far-back-as-2014) that Facebook had been informed, in 2014, that computers with Russian I.P. addresses were siphoning three billion data points a day from Facebook accounts, a claim that Allan refused to address in the hearing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Collins published the full cache that he seized from Kramer. The [two hundred and fifty pages](https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Note-by-Chair-and-selected-documents-ordered-from-Six4Three.pdf) of internal Facebook documents show, irrefutably, that the company did indeed whitelist a number of lucrative business partners, including Netflix, Lyft, and Airbnb, allowing them continued and unfettered access to the accounts of Facebook users and their friends after the company claimed that it had stopped the practice. The documents also reveal that, in 2015, a permissions update for Android devices, which users were required to accept, included a feature that continuously uploaded text messages and call logs to Facebook. \n\nThe fallout from Ted Kramerâs London misadventure was just one debacle of many during Facebookâs terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month. Back at Facebook headquarters, in Menlo Park, Zuckerberg was quite busy after all, doing damage control after a scathing New York *Times* exposÃ©. â[Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebookâs Leaders Fought Through Crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html),â which was published on November 14th, created one of the biggest crises in the companyâs history. As if to prove the reportersâ claims, Zuckerberg publicly denied their veracity. But the *Times* piece was deeply sourced and contained the disturbing revelation that the company had enlisted a right-wing opposition-research group, Definers Public Affairs, to dig up dirt on [George Soros](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-soros) after Soros gave a blistering [speech](https://www.businessinsider.com/george-soros-calls-facebook-google-menace-society-obstacles-innovation-2018-1) at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, decrying the power of social media, especially Facebook and [Google](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/google), for their âfar-reaching adverse consequences on the functioning of democracy, particularly on the integrity of elections.â\n\nDefiners Public Affairs had previously [pushed](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/everything-facebook-said-on-sheryl-sandberg-definers-since-nyt-report.html) out misinformation about the Apple C.E.O., Tim Cook, on behalf of the tech company Qualcomm, which wanted to undermine Cookâs relationship with the Trump Administration. For Facebook, Definers launched a P.R. campaignâpropagated through the conservative and alt-right media ecospheresâthat traded on anti-Semitic innuendo to suggest that Soros was the deep pockets behind a grassroots anti-Facebook group.  News of Facebookâs campaign against Soros came out three weeks after Cesar Sayoc, a fervent Trump supporter, sent a pipe bomb to Sorosâand also to the Clintons, the billionaire Tom Steyer, and other prominent Democrats. \n\nAnd then it got worse. On November 15th, shortly after the *Times* exposÃ© was published, Facebook [claimed](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/everything-facebook-said-on-sheryl-sandberg-definers-since-nyt-report.html), âThe New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebookâs behalf or to spread misinformation.â The next day, Facebookâs chief operating officer, [Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/sheryl-sandberg), who is in charge of the companyâs communications team, said, somewhat intricately, âI did not know about or hire Definers or any firm.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;Definers was hired, we have lots of firms. They were hired not to smear anyone.â But then, the night before Thanksgiving, in a Facebook blog post that the company perhaps thought would be lost in the holiday shuffle, Sandberg allowed that âI did receive a small number of e-mails where Definers was referenced.â A week later, after another damning [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/technology/definers-public-affairs-tim-miller.html) in the *Times*, a company spokesperson admitted that it was Sandberg herself who had initiated an investigation into whether Soros had a financial interest in criticizing Facebookâthat is, if the veteran financier had engaged in what is called âshort and distort,â trash-talking a company after betting that its stock will lose value. Not surprisingly, he hadnât.\n\nSorosâs complaints about Facebook were hardly original: former Facebook employees such as Chamath Palihapitiya, who served as its vice-president for growth, and investors including Roger McNamee have made similar criticisms. Nor was Soros being speculative. At the time of his Davos talk, the companyâs role in enabling Russian operatives to exploit social divisions in the United States through Facebook ads and user pages, and helping the Trump campaign suppress the African-American vote, were well known. Indeed, in a two-part âFrontlineâ documentary, â[The Facebook Dilemma](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/facebook-dilemma/),â which was released at the end of October, a collection of former Facebook employees expressed concerns about the unwillingness of Zuckerberg and Sandberg to take meaningful responsibility for Facebookâs immense power and capacity to do harm. âMy concerns, at the time, were that I knew that there were all these malicious actors who would do a wide range of bad things given the opportunity, given the ability to target people based on this information that Facebook had,â Sandy Parakilas, who had been the companyâs platform-operations manager in 2011, told the filmmakers. âSo I started thinking through what are the worst-case scenarios of what people could do with this data&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;and I shared that with a number of people, both people in privacy and some senior executives. And the response was muted, I would say.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;I got the sense that this just wasnât their priority. They werenât that concerned about the vulnerabilities that the company was creating.â\n\nThose vulnerabilities were on full display on November 5th, the day before the midterm elections. In an effort to prevent the kinds of malign interferences that had dogged the Presidential election two years earlier, Facebook had set up what it was calling a âwar roomâ to monitor its network. The company had already [removed](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/31/technology/facebook-removes-pages/index.html) thirty Facebook pages, which it believed were designed by Russians to interfere with the elections. The war room was both a public declaration that Facebook was taking fake news and propaganda seriously and an admission that the platform remained susceptible to manipulation. âThis is going to be a constant arms race,â Katie Harbath, Facebookâs global-politics and government-outreach director, [told](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17991924/facebook-election-war-room-misinformation-fake-news-whatsapp) the Verge. âThis is our new normal. Bad actors are going to get more sophisticated in what theyâre doing, and weâre going to have to get more sophisticated in trying to catch them.â Since elections happen around the world throughout the year, the company planned to keep the war room open âfor the foreseeable future.â\n\nThat same day, Business for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit organization, issued a report that Facebook had commissioned to address concerns about the platformâs role in the Rohingya genocide, in Myanmar. While the Facebook platform has been used in other countries to cultivate ethnic and sectarian violenceâNigeria, Germany, Egypt, India, and Sri Lanka among themâits co-optation by the Myanmar Army was especially heinous. Adopting the playbook of Russian operatives, the Army created hundreds of seemingly innocuous Facebook accounts about celebrities, entertainment, and beauty, which it used to plant incendiary narratives about the countryâs Muslim minority. In its response to the B.S.R. report, Alex Warofka, Facebookâs product-policy manager, said that the company had already implemented a number of its recommendations but that âthere is more to do.â \n\nShortly after the Myanmar report was issued, Facebook was compelled to take down an inflammatory, racist [video ad](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-runs-racist-ad-on-facebook-targeting-arizona-and-florida), paid for by the Trump campaign, on the grounds that the ad âviolates Facebookâs advertising policy against sensational content.â The spot, which targeted voters in Florida and Arizona, blamed Democrats for an undocumented immigrant who had twice been deported before killing two sheriffâs deputies, in Sacramento, in 2014\\. Facebookâs policy disallows ads that are âdehumanizing or denigrating [to an] entire group of people, and using frightening and exaggerated rumors of danger.â The company removed the ad only after it had already been seen on Facebook by as many as five million people. And hereâs the rub: while the ad âcannot receive paid distribution,â the company declared, âthe video is allowed to be posted on Facebook.â So there you have it, the fecklessness of Facebook in a single sentence.\n\nNovember has passed, but Facebookâs troubles have not. A departing African-American Facebook employee charged, in a Facebook [post](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/27/facebook-has-problem-black-people-former-employee-says/2126056002/), that the company was âfailing its black employees and its black usersâ; Facebook [took down](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/04/facebook-mark-s-luckie-african-american-workers-users) his post. *Wired* [reported](https://www.wired.com/story/nonprofits-facebook-get-hacked-need-help/) that the company was abandoning charitiesâwhich it had lured to the platformâonce theyâd been hacked. The election war room has been [dismantled](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/26/facebook-wont-use-its-war-room-for-future-elections-report-says.html), leading some to suggest that it was a publicity stunt. Definers Public Affairs is no longer working for Facebook, but the damage to Sheryl Sandbergâs credibility and carefully coiffed public persona may prove irreversibleâas Michelle Obama [said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/03/michelle-obama-lean-in-sheryl-sandberg) the other day, âitâs not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesnât work all the time.â And that creepy Pikinis app, courtesy of Damian Collins, has now supplied a portrait of naked greed and corporate dissembling. That empty seat in Parliament, where Mark Zuckerberg chose not to sit to answer the concerns of the global community, has suddenly got much hotter.\n\n*A previous version of this article misstated when Facebook first hired Definers Public Affairs.* ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c80e56e652c90274670","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cambridge Analytica","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cambridge-analytica"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c9781ab3335f580f19e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sheryl Sandberg","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sheryl-sandberg"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f161ebe912338a3717da","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5ac2e2e17730741c5fa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sue Halpern, a contributing writer covering politics and technology, has been writing for *The New Yorker* since 2005.

At five degrees of warming, much of the planet would be in constant drought. With just six metres of sea-level riseâan optimistic projectionâland where three hundred and seventy-five million people currently live will be underwater. Some of the apocalyptic stories arenât from the future but our recent past: in the [Paradise Camp Fire](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-californias-efforts-to-prevent-wildfires-reflect-a-national-crisis-on-climate-change) of late 2018, people fleeing the flames âfound themselves sprinting past exploding cars, their sneakers melting to the asphalt as they ran.â  \n\nTo anyone who has been paying attention, the broad strokes of âThe Uninhabitable Earthâ come as no surprise. We are racing towardâin fact have already enteredâan era of water shortage, wildfire, sea-level rise, and extreme weather. To read the book is to ask hard questions about oneâs own future. When will the city where I live be flooded? Where should I live when it does? Where will my future children live? Should I have children at all?\n\nYet Wallace-Wells has also stressed that there is no place for fatalism. [In an interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/19/695874069/-uninhabitable-earth-draws-attention-to-3-major-misunderstandings-about-climate), he said that âevery inch of warming makes a differenceââwe cannot stop the process of warming altogether, but we can control whether climate change yields a future that is apocalyptic or instead âmerely grim.â Several years ago, I [asked](https://www.guernicamag.com/bill-mckibben-planetary-emergency/) the climate activist and writer [Bill McKibben](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/bill-mckibben) how he was able to keep from falling into depression, given how much time he devotes to thinking about climate change. He answered that fighting is the keyâitâs only despairing if you think that you canât take on the problem. âItâs the greatest fight in human history, one whose outcome will reverberate for geologic time, and it has to happen right now,â he said.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the American Psychological Association put together a task force to examine the relationship between psychology and climate change. It found that, although people said that climate change was important, they did not âfeel a sense of urgency.â The task force identified several mental barriers that contributed to this blasÃ© stance. People were uncertain about climate change, mistrustful of the science, or denied that it was related to human activity. They tended to minimize the risks and believe that there was plenty of time to make changes before the real impacts were felt. Just ten years later, these attitudes about climate feel like ancient relics. But two key factors, which the task force identified as keeping people from taking action, have stood the test of time: one was habit, and the other was lack of control. âIngrained behaviors are extremely resistant to permanent change,â the group stated. âPeople believe their actions would be too small to make a difference and choose to do nothing.â\n\nWallace-Wells hits this note in his book, too, writing, âWe seem most comfortable adopting a learned posture of powerlessness.â As uncertainty and denial about climate have diminished, they have been replaced by similarly paralyzing feelings of panic, anxiety, and resignation. As we begin to live through the massive dangers imparted by climate change, as one psychologist put it to me, âWe are in psychological terrain, whether we like it or not.â\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nJohn Fraser is a conservation psychologist who has studied burnout and trauma among people doing environmental work. âWe have to move beyond terrorizing people with disaster stories,â he told me. Responses to climate change are often discussed as a spectrum, with denial and disengagement at one end and intense alarm on the other. We are getting more alarmed. In 2009, [a Yale and George Mason study](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/) grouped Americansâ responses to climate into six categories: alarmed, concerned, cautious, disengaged, doubtful, and dismissive. In 2009, eighteen per cent were alarmed; in 2018, that number had risen to twenty-nine per cent. \n\nFraser wants people to feel not alarmed but activated, and he takes a relentlessly positive, solutions-oriented attitude. âWe got trains all the way across America in a few years, and people on the moon in a few years,â  he said. And ideas for climate moonshots abound: [negative-carbon-emission plants](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/can-carbon-dioxide-removal-save-the-world) are prohibitively expensive, but they do exist; some advocate for reviving nuclear power; proponents of a [Green New Deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-good-news-about-a-green-new-deal) call for ending fossil-fuel extraction and subsidies, and radically expanding public transportation. In Silicon Valley, ideas are emerging that rely less on politics than on technology, like flooding some deserts to grow carbon-sucking algae beds, or using electrochemistry to get rocks to absorb carbon from the air. Fraser believes that the most productive way to communicate about environmental problems is to emphasize the positive solutions that exist. âWhat we need to promote is hope,â he said. âThe first step to a healthy response is feeling that the problem is solvable.â\n\nâIs it appropriate to feel terrified? No,â Fraser said. âBecause you just shut down.â\n\nMargaret Klein Salamon, who trained as a clinical psychologist before founding a [climate-advocacy organization](https://www.theclimatemobilization.org/), takes the opposite view. She doesnât see fear as paralyzing but as a necessary response that activates people to recognize danger and take action. Whatâs more, given the state of the atmosphere, she argues that acute fear is rational. âItâs important to feel afraid of things that will kill usâthat is healthy and good,â she said. She believes that reckoning with the scope of the emergency is required, both to activate responsible behavior and to reap the mental-health benefits of âliving in climate truth.â Salamon, who grew up in a family of psychoanalysts and considers therapy to be âsomething of a family business,â is writing âTransform Yourself with Climate Truth,â a self-help book on the subject.\n\nSalamon said that itâs no surprise that people canât process the truth about the climate crisis and instead construct defense mechanisms against it. In twenty years, what now registers as an extreme heat wave will likely be the norm. By 2045, more than three hundred thousand U.S. homes will be lost to encroaching oceans; by 2100, a trillion dollarsâ worth of real estate will be lost in the U.S. alone. As atmospheric carbon levels rise, plants produce more sugars and fewer nutrientsâby 2050, vegetables will be turning into junk food. Thereâs a huge overlap between things that wreak havoc on the climate and things that serve a materialist version of the good, comfortable life: meat-eating, air-conditioning, air travel. âItâs a basic part of being human that our minds frequently deal with competing interestsâthatâs how defense mechanisms are formed,â Salamon said.\n\nSalamon hosts periodic phone sessions in which callers can dial in to discuss their feelings about climate change and climate activism. All sorts of emotions have come up on these calls: guilt and shame, grief, panic, helplessness, even âdestructive gleeâ from people who are angry that their warnings havenât been heeded. Salamon stresses the importance of processing climate change as an emotional and personal phenomenon, not just a scientific one. Everyone, she said, needs to grieve for his or her own future, which isnât going to look the way we thought. Itâs going to be more parched, more crowded, more dangerous, and more austere.\n \n-=-=-=-\n\nIn October, 2017, Wallace-Wells spoke on a panel at the annual conference of the Society of Environmental Journalists that was titled âDoomsday Stories: The Ethics and Efficacy of Doomsday Reporting.â The conversation largely followed the fault line between scaring readers and offering them hope. Coming down hard on the side of fear, Wallace-Wells passed along something he had been told by the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who said, âYou really canât let peopleâs need for hope get in the way of the telling the truth.â And fear is useful, Wallace-Wells said: the threat of mutually assured destruction motivated world leaders to end the Cold War, and fear of cancer has led people to quit smoking. âItâs a little too simplistic to think that anything that is scary is inevitably paralyzing to the public, and I think itâs a little patronizing,â he said. \n\nOne of the other panelists was the psychologist and communications expert Renee Lertzman, who argued that it was necessary to âblow up the dichotomyâ between fear and hope, or truth and positivity. The problem with the horror-story narratives is not necessarily that they are frightening, she said, but that they are presented almost cinematicallyâplacing people outside of the action in the âpolitically neutralizingâ position of âtitillated, excited, fearful spectators.â In her book â[Environmental Melancholia](https://www.amazon.com/Environmental-Melancholia-Psychoanalytic-dimensions-Explorations/dp/0415727995),â Lertzman argues that unprocessed grief about ecological devastation is a big part of what prevents people from addressing environmental challenges. This âarrested, inchoate form of mourningâ keeps people locked in a state of inaction, she writes.\n\nWhen I spoke to Lertzman, she talked about the need to have conversations about climate change that allow space for people to processâor at least acknowledgeâtheir feelings. A gesture as simple as beginning a conversation by allowing a few moments to say, â âDamn, this is intense,â â she told me, âfrees up a lot of energy to move into problem-solving mode.â This recognition is a familiar move in psychology: first acknowledging that a topic is difficult and then wading in. It reminded me of the way that a doctor with a good bedside manner might approach delivering a difficult diagnosis, but Lertzman said that itâs more complicated than that: because of our culpability in the climate crisis, discussing it is like getting news about a health issue thatâs directly related to oneâs own habits. You not only have to face a scary future but reckon with how you helped to create it. âWe have to come to terms with the fact that what weâre doing is no longer sustainable, and the onus is on us to rise to the occasion,â she said.\n\nâWhat works really well is when people feel that they are invited and inspired to be part of something constructive, combined with having the safety to grapple with the magnitude of things,â Lertzman told me. This way of thinking loops back to Bill McKibbenâs advice, that the only cure for climate agita is activism. Susan Clayton, a professor of social psychology and environmental studies (and a member of the A.P.A.âs climate-change task force, a decade ago), made a similar point, telling me that whatâs good for the climateâin the form of participation in a community effortâis also good for the psyche. âItâs similar to the civil-rights movement,â she said. âThe act of coming together is empowering and validating.â\n\nIn a poignant essay posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@maryheglar/sorry-yall-but-climate-change-ain-t-the-first-existential-threat-b3c999267aa0), Mary AnnaÃ¯se Heglar, who works at the Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote that the climate movement has a lot to learn from the civil-rights movement. Climate change might be the first existential threat levelled at all of humanity, but America itself has been an existential threat to black people for hundreds of years. Describing the calculated violence of Jim Crow, she writes, âI want you to understand how overwhelming, how insurmountable it must have felt. I want you to understand that there was no end in sight.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;They, too, trembled for every baby born into that world.â The flooding and fires of our changed climate may be unprecedented, but the threat of annihilation is certainly notâin their discussions of climate change, both Wallace-Wells and Salamon refer to their ancestors who lived through the Holocaust. Put in this light, the response of quiet climate denialismânot disbelief in the phenomenon but the choice to bury oneâs head in the sand because thinking about it is too unpleasantâis not just untenable but childish. As Heglar writes, âYou donât fight something like that because you think you will win. You fight because you have to.â\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAbout halfway through âThe Uninhabitable Earth,â Wallace-Wells pauses to give his âbrave readerâ a small pat on the back for making it through what would be âenough horror to induce a panic attack in even the most optimistic.â When I started reading the book, the experience was shockingly physical. My heart beat faster as I was reading about the disasters to come. My eyes filled with tears as I tracked Wallace-Wellsâs climate timelines with the coming decades of my life, or those of the children I might have.  But as I read on, in the course of several days, I became acclimated. I could read it with my mind, without my fight-or-flight systems getting in the way. This felt strangely empowering.\n\nWallace-Wells writes that the past century of fossil-fuel extraction and industrial capitalism has enabled a life style I enjoyâthat this very process âmade middle-class-ness possibleâ for billions of people.â Yet, at the same time, it is a system that must be radically overhauled. Modern people have a tendency, he writes, to see human systems as more inviolable than natural ones. And so ârenovating capitalism so that it doesnât reward fossil fuel extraction can seem unlikelier than suspending sulfur in the air to dye the sky red and cool the planet off by a degree or two.â Itâs why creating global factories to suck carbon out of the atmosphere might appear to be easier than simply ending fossil-fuel subsidies, he writes. These are the competing truths we have to integrate: a livable world is incompatible with fossil fuels, and fossil fuels made the world we live in.\n\nDecarbonizing the economy will be difficult, but it must be done. It will be hardâbut not as hard as surviving the catalogue of disasters that will befall us if we donât. This is, to my mind, the great strength of Wallace-Wellsâs approach to storytelling. The thing to grieve, then, is not the Earthâs habitable climate but, instead, the century of carefree car-driving and reckless deforestation, the years of eating meat with abandon and inexpensively flying around the worldâand the massive economic growth that this system has enabled. Overhauling the fossil-fuel economy will represent a true loss, but its sacrifices will be nowhere near the alternative. The process is subject to all matter of difficulties: the problem of collective action, scientific uncertainty, technological challenges, political mobilization, and many others. But to do anything less is to go insane.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1c9722d4972cd5b832b5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c9722d4972cd5b832b5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Book Reviews","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"book-reviews"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Book Reviews","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"book-reviews"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Psychology","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"psychology"}],"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"},{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Elements","parent":[{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"Science","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a7d92e2e17730741c744","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-riederer","email":"","name":"Rachel Riederer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Rachel Riederer is a member of The New Yorkerâs editorial staff.

Brand had an interest in using genetic technology for conservation, and when Church said that he read and wrote DNA, Brand told me, âthat got my attention.â Reading DNA had been done before, but writing DNA was something new. The two hit it off and have been collaborating on a project to resurrect the woolly mammoth, the giant Arctic elephant that went extinct ten thousand years ago. Church is a pioneer in genetic technologyâhe helped develop the *CRISPR*{:.small}-Cas9 technology that a researcher in China recently used on the worldâs first [genetically edited newborns](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/he-jiankui-and-the-implications-of-experimenting-with-genetically-edited-babies)âand, in his lab, scientists are working on bringing the prehistoric pachyderm back from extinction. The process would involve adding certain mammoth genetic adaptations, like a long, dense pelt and layers of insulating fat, to the DNA of Asian elephants, which share more than ninety-nine per cent of their DNA with their extinct cousins. Church and Brand have a vision of herds of future mammoths grazing the steppes of the far north. \n\nChurchâs woolly mammoth research is just one of several de-extinction projectsâthere are about ten underway nowâthat aim to use genetics to restore lost species. In her book â[The Re-Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/Re-Origin-Species-second-extinct-animals/dp/194753436X),â the Swedish science journalist Torill Kornfeldt travels the world meeting the scientists and conservationists involved in this movement. In California, she talks with Ben Novak, a scientist obsessed with bringing back the passenger pigeonâa bird that once travelled in flocks that were so giant and dense, Novak tells her, that they âswept through the landscape, with the same effect as forest fires.â In upstate New York, a researcher is working toward restoring the American chestnut, which was decimated by blight in the late eighteen-hundreds. Until then, chestnuts were so prevalent in the eastern half of the United States that, when their white blossoms fell in the spring, the hillsides looked like they were covered in snow; in the fall, their sweet, starchy nuts served as a free, abundant harvest. At Australiaâs Sea Simulator aquarium, resurrection scientists are working on coral, which faces an existential threat from the rapid warming and acidifying of ocean waters. These researchers want to help coral avoid extinction by âtrying to nudge evolution,â imbuing them with traits that will allow them to survive the hotter oceans of the future. \n\nSome of the projects Kornfeldt writes about are incredibly compelling, given that we are living through a [mass-extinction event](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/25/the-sixth-extinction) that threatens the stability of the worldâs ecosystems. But de-extinctionâs appeal also works on a much smaller scale: who wouldnât want to restore the beautiful chestnut to its former, generous glory? It disappeared from the Eastern forests so recently that, in some places, intact root systems still push up new saplings that grow briefly before succumbing to the blight that still lives in other, unaffected trees. And Kornfeldtâs account of seeing one of the last living northern white rhinocerosesâan elderly female called Nola, lumbering around her zoo enclosure, rotund and majesticâframes de-extinction as not just an ecological service but a rescue mission for individual creatures. By the time the book went to press, Nola had died, but cells of some of the last of her kind live on in the Frozen Zoo, a San Diego facility where eggs, sperm, and embryos from thousands of threatened or extinct species are kept in cold storage. Those tiny cells contain a world of possibility and rebirth, held in limbo under a layer of liquid nitrogen. \n\nNola makes for a charismatic ambassador of de-extinction, but some of the other projects raise big questions, both ethical and practical. Itâs hard to imagine how one might go about introducing herds of woolly mammoths in the near-future Arctic: If the mammoths make it into existence, will temperatures in the far north still be cold enough to sustain a habitat for them? And just whose land do these giant herd animals get to graze? Meanwhile, the passenger pigeons, which used to descend in flocks that left areas picked clean and covered in guano, sound less Garden of Eden than Biblical plague. Another Harvard researcher, Arkhat Abzhanov, is modifying chicken embryos to make them more like their dinosaur ancestors; he likens his research to âexamining birdsâ family tree by moving backwards along the branches.â Abzhanov doesnât let the embryos hatch, and itâs not clear that their mix of genetic features would allow them to function if they did. Kornfeldt writes that âchicken-sized dinosaur pets might sell like hot cakesâ and âbe delightfully harmlessââbut if such animals were to be brought into the world, what would they be? Itâs impossible not to think of Frankensteinâs monster, in both the creatureâs monstrosity and its suffering.  \n\nItâs this tensionâeven more than the specifics surrounding the revival of any one speciesâthat carries Kornfeldtâs stories along: she constantly pursues the question of what all of this means for humanityâs relationship to nature. To bring species backâfrom extinction or from its brinkâis a godlike power. Stewart Brand, ever bullish on human potential, has said, âWe are as gods and have to get good at it.â He sees species revival as part of a tech-forward approach to environmentalism. âBiotech has an enormous amount to bring to conservation,â he told me. We already wipe species out on the regular, so if weâre going to have godlike power, why not wield it intentionally and responsibly? \n\nBen Minteer, a professor of environmental ethics and one of the few de-extinction critics featured in the book, points out the danger of humanity becoming âmesmerised by its own power.â He recommends an âearthly modestyâ: instead of trying to engineer our way out of planetary ruin by further altering nature, we should scale back destruction instead. The debate calls to mind what Bill McKibben wrote, in 1989, in â[The End of Nature](http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1989-09-11#folio=072)â: âWe have deprived nature of its independence, and that is fatal to its meaning. Natureâs independence *is* its meaning.â By changing the climate through carbon emissions, he wrote, humanity had infiltrated every part of the wilderness, leaving nothing untouched. The same idea applies here. Whatever any of these genetically resurrected species might be, they wonât be part of nature.                                                                                                \n\n-=-=-=-\n\nReading the science of de-extinction can inspire a lot of hopeânot necessarily about the species themselves, but for demonstrating how relatively fast an area of science can develop. (The first genetically engineered plant was created in the early eighties. The human genome was sequenced in 2003\\. In 2006, a technique was developed to turn specialized cells into stem cells.) Thereâs an element of serendipity to scientific discovery, but that kind of progress doesnât happen by accidentâitâs the result of the concentrated effort that happens when broad swaths of society decide to make something a priority. In the nineties, the Human Genome Project was the new moon landing, publicly funded with almost three billion dollars from the U.S. government, and running alongside parallel projects supported by private corporations and other governments. When the first sequencing was complete, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair announced it together at the White House, using language that was [heraldic even for Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse3.archives.gov/WH/Work/062600.html): âWe are learning the language in which God created life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With this profound new knowledge, humankind is on the verge of gaining immense, new power to heal.â \n\nReading about the ways that bold, public investment in genetics has paid off, I canât help but wish for the same level of investmentâin public attention, funding, enthusiasmâto be directed toward the scientific approaches that are necessary to decarbonize the economy, shift global energy patterns, and mitigate climate change. The research into [carbon capture](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/can-carbon-dioxide-removal-save-the-world) and zero-emissions energy should attract the very best minds; the work should be lavished with public attention, funding, and enthusiasm. The Human Genome Project and the moon landing were the big, showy results that bloomed out of decades of research; viable technological climate fixes wonât just appear overnight. And, with Trump in the White House and his climate-denying appointees running energy and environmental policy, such a shift is its own kind of [moon shot](https://www.gq.com/story/green-new-deal-explainer?verso=true). But the advocates of a [Green New Deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/creating-a-road-map-for-a-green-new-deal), such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are thinking on this kind of scale. As Robinson Meyer writes in [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-winning-climate-strategy/576514/), âIn the 1960s, the U.S. pointed the full power of its military-technological industry at going to the moon. Ocasio-Cortez wants to do the same thing, except to save the planet.â\n\nAs it turns out, the mammoths themselves could have a role to play in combating climate change. A main reason for the interest in bringing back the woolly mammothâor in introducing some new, mammothlike elephantâis its potential impact on the climate. At a nature reserve in Siberia called Pleistocene Park, the father and son scientists, Nikita and Sergey Zimov, are leading the effort to protect the permafrost with grazing herbivores. (My colleague Elizabeth Kolbert first [wrote about Pleistocene Park](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/recall-of-the-wild) in this magazine in 2012\\.) The permafrost, a thick layer of soil, sediment or rock that stays frozen year-round, is thawing. And that makes people nervous, because as it melts it will release a great quantity of greenhouse-gas emissions. Herbivores help because, in the winter, they act like snow plows, kicking up the snow and compacting it in their efforts to get to the grass beneath, exposing the ground to the frigid air and keeping it frozen. Inside the park, a mix of horses, elk, reindeer, oxen, and a lone bison roam and graze, and have restored the grassland by clearing it of scrubby bushes. Brand calls Pleistocene Park âone of the most gonzo pieces of science ever,â and, according to Nikita Zimov, itâs already working: the permafrost half a meter below the surface is seventeen degrees colder inside the park than it is outside. Mammoths, one imagines, would be even better snow-tramplers. George Church, a genetics pioneer and an eternal optimist, sums it up, though perhaps with some hyperbole: âSo it could be mammoths that save the climate.â \n\nOf course, Churchâs optimism might not be borne out. But Zimovâs anecdotal results are shored up by a new paper, [published, on December 6th, in *Science*](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/ysof-cpa120518.php), that shows that the presence of animals in an ecosystem can have dramatic impacts on landscapesâeven swinging them from being net carbon emitters to carbon sinks. But they can also do the reverse, depending on the vegetation, the animal, and a host of other factors. This finding reverses the conventional wisdom around climate modelling, that âlow-abundantâ animal populations canât impact an ecosystemâs carbon cycling the way that carbon-storing plants and carbon-gushing humans do. âSome of us have been saying for a long time that itâs not just animal abundance that matters but what these animals do that is important,â Oswald J. Schmitz, the studyâs lead author, said in a release. \n\nHumans have long been managers of nature. In the Serengeti, at the turn of the twentieth century, the wildebeest population was decimated by a cattle virus in less than a decade. Carcasses dotted the savanna. Without the grazers keeping grass in check, an overgrowth of dry ground vegetation set the stage for devastating wildfires. When the herds recovered, however, more carbon was recycled and kept in the landscape, turning the savanna back to a carbon sink. The herds made their comeback after a vaccination campaignâa de-extinction project of a different sort.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1c79397f5b30646d05e8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Extinction","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"extinction"},{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a244997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Animals","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"animals"}],"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7d92e2e17730741c744","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-riederer","email":"","name":"Rachel Riederer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Rachel Riederer is a member of The New Yorkerâs editorial staff.

I was in my twenties when I wrote it, and out on an intellectual limb: climate science was still young. But the data were persuasive, and freighted with sadness. We were spewing so much carbon into the atmosphere that nature was no longer a force beyond our influenceâand humanity, with its capacity for industry and heedlessness, had come to affect every cubic metre of the planetâs air, every inch of its surface, every drop of its water. Scientists underlined this notion a decade later when they began referring to our era as the Anthropocene, the world made by man.\n\nI was frightened by my reporting, but, at the time, it seemed likely that weâd try as a society to prevent the worst from happening. In 1988, GeorgeÂ H.Â W. Bush, running for President, promised that he would fight âthe greenhouse effect with the White House effect.â He did not, nor did his successors, nor did their peers in seats of power around the world, and so in the intervening decades what was a theoretical threat has become a fierce daily reality. As this essay goes to press, California is ablaze. A big fire near Los Angeles forced the evacuation of Malibu, and an even larger fire, in the Sierra Nevada foothills, has become the most destructive in Californiaâs history. After a summer of unprecedented high temperatures and a fall ârainy seasonâ with less than half the usual precipitation, the northern firestorm turned a city called Paradise into an inferno within an hour, razing more than ten thousand buildings and killing at least sixty-three people; more than six hundred others are missing. The authorities brought in cadaver dogs, a lab to match evacueesâ DNA with swabs taken from the dead, and anthropologists from California State University at Chico to advise on how to identify bodies from charred bone fragments.\n\nFor the past few years, a tide of optimistic thinking has held that conditions for human beings around the globe have been improving. Wars are scarcer, poverty and hunger are less severe, and there are better prospects for wide-scale literacy and education. But there are newer signs that human progress has begun to flag. In the face of our environmental deterioration, itâs now reasonable to ask whether the human game has begun to falterâperhaps even to play itself out. Late in 2017, a United Nations agency announced that the number of chronically malnourished people in the world, after a decade of decline, had started to grow againâby thirty-eight million, to a total of eight hundred and fifteen million, âlargely due to the proliferation of violent conflicts and climate-related shocks.â In June, 2018, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. found that child labor, after years of falling, was growing, âdriven in part by an increase in conflicts and climate-induced disasters.â\n\nIn 2015, at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris, the worldâs governments, noting that the earth has so far warmed a little more than one degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, set a goal of holding the increase this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with a fallback target of two degrees (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). This past October, the U.N.âs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a special report stating that global warming âis likely to reach 1.5 C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.â We will have drawn a line in the sand and then watched a rising tide erase it. The report did not mention that, in Paris, countriesâ initial pledges would cut emissions only enough to limit warming to 3.5 degrees Celsius (about 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, a scale and pace of change so profound as to call into question whether our current societies could survive it.\n\nScientists have warned for decades that climate change would lead to extreme weather. Shortly before the I.P.C.C. report was published, Hurricane Michael, the strongest hurricane ever to hit the Florida Panhandle, inflicted thirty billion dollarsâ worth of material damage and killed forty-five people. President Trump, who has argued that global warming is âa total, and very expensive, hoax,â visited Florida to survey the wreckage, but told reporters that the storm had not caused him to rethink his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accords. He expressed no interest in the I.P. C.C. report beyond asking âwho drew it.â (The answer is ninety-one researchers from forty countries.) He later claimed that his ânatural instinctâ for science made him confident that the climate would soon âchange back.â A month later, Trump blamed the fires in California on âgross mismanagement of forests.â\n\nHuman beings have always experienced wars and truces, crashes and recoveries, famines and terrorism. Weâve endured tyrants and outlasted perverse ideologies. Climate change is different. As a team of scientists recently pointed out in the journal _Nature Climate Change_, the physical shifts weâre inflicting on the planet will âextend longer than the entire history of human civilization thus far.â\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5bee0dd1050708639d6e1404]||||||\n+++\n\nThe poorest and most vulnerable will pay the highest price. But already, even in the most affluent areas, many of us hesitate to walk across a grassy meadow because of the proliferation of ticks bearing Lyme disease which have come with the hot weather; we have found ourselves unable to swim off beaches, because jellyfish, which thrive as warming seas kill off other marine life, have taken over the water. The planetâs diameter will remain eight thousand miles, and its surface will still cover two hundred million square miles. But the earth, for humans, has begun to shrink, under our feet and in our minds.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nâClimate change,â like âurban sprawlâ or âgun violence,â has become such a familiar term that we tend to read past it. But exactly what weâve been up to should fill us with awe. During the past two hundred years, we have burned immense quantities of coal and gas and oilâin car motors, basement furnaces, power plants, steel millsâand, as we have done so, carbon atoms have combined with oxygen atoms in the air to produce carbon dioxide. This, along with other gases like methane, has trapped heat that would otherwise have radiated back out to space.\n\nThere are at least four other episodes in the earthâs half-billion-year history of animal life when CO~2~ has poured into the atmosphere in greater volumes, but perhaps never at greater speeds. Even at the end of the Permian Age, when huge injections of CO~2~ from volcanoes burning through coal deposits culminated in âThe Great Dying,â the CO~2~ content of the atmosphere grew at perhaps a tenth of the current pace. Two centuries ago, the concentration of CO~2~ in the atmosphere was two hundred and seventy-five parts per million; it has now topped four hundred parts per million and is rising more than two parts per million each year. The extra heat that we trap near the planet every day is equivalent to the heat from four hundred thousand bombs the size of the one that was dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nAs a result, in the past thirty years weâve seen all twenty of the hottest years ever recorded. The melting of ice caps and glaciers and the rising levels of our oceans and seas, initially predicted for the end of the century, have occurred decades early. âIâve never been atÂ .Â .Â . a climate conference where people say âthat happened slower than I thought it would,âÂ â Christina Hulbe, a New Zealand climatologist, told a reporter for _Grist_ last year. This past May, a team of scientists from the University of Illinois reported that there was a thirty-five-per-cent chance that, because of unexpectedly high economic growth rates, the U.N.âs âworst-case scenarioâ for global warming was too optimistic. âWe are now truly in uncharted territory,â David Carlson, the former director of the World Meteorological Organizationâs climate-research division, said in the spring of 2017, after data showed that the previous year had broken global heat records.\n\nWe are off the literal charts as well. In August, I visited Greenland, where, one day, with a small group of scientists and activists, I took a boat from the village of Narsaq to a glacier on a nearby fjord. As we made our way across a broad bay, I glanced up at the electronic chart above the captainâs wheel, where a blinking icon showed that we were a mile inland. The captain explained that the chart was from five years ago, when the water around us was still ice. The American glaciologist Jason Box, who organized the trip, chose our landing site. âWe called this place the Eagle Glacier because of its shape,â he said. The name, too, was five years old. âThe head and the wings of the bird have melted away. I donât know what we should call it now, but the eagle is dead.â\n\nThere were two poets among the crew, Aka Niviana, who is Greenlandic, and Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, from the low-lying Marshall Islands, in the Pacific, where âking tidesâ recently washed through living rooms and unearthed graveyards. A small lens of fresh water has supported life on the Marshall Islandsâ atolls for millennia, but, as salt water intrudes, breadfruit trees and banana palms wilt and die. As the Greenlandic ice we were gazing at continues to melt, the water will drown Jetnil-Kijinerâs homeland. About a third of the carbon responsible for these changes has come from the United States.\n\nA few days after the boat trip, the two poets and I accompanied the scientists to another fjord, where they needed to change the memory card on a camera that tracks the retreat of the ice sheet. As we took off for the flight home over the snout of a giant glacier, an eight-story chunk calved off the face and crashed into the ocean. Iâd never seen anything quite like it for sheer powerâthe waves rose twenty feet as it plunged into the dark water. You could imagine the same waves washing through the Marshalls. You could almost sense the ice elevating the ocean by a sliverâalong the seafront in Mumbai, which already floods on a stormy day, and at the Battery in Manhattan, where the seawall rises just a few feet above the water.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen I say the world has begun to shrink, this is what I mean. Until now, human beings have been spreading, from our beginnings in Africa, out across the globeâslowly at first, and then much faster. But a period of contraction is setting in as we lose parts of the habitable earth. Sometimes our retreat will be hasty and violent; the effort to evacuate the blazing California towns along narrow roads was so chaotic that many people died in their cars. But most of the pullback will be slower, starting along the worldâs coastlines. Each year, another twenty-four thousand people abandon Vietnamâs sublimely fertile Mekong Delta as crop fields are polluted with salt. As sea ice melts along the Alaskan coast, there is nothing to protect towns, cities, and native villages from the waves. In Mexico Beach, Florida, which was all but eradicated by Hurricane Michael, a resident told the Washington _Post_, âThe older people canât rebuild; itâs too late in their lives. Who is going to be left? Who is going to care?â\n\nIn one week at the end of last year, I read accounts from Louisiana, where government officials were finalizing a plan to relocate thousands of people threatened by the rising Gulf (âNot everybody is going to live where they are now and continue their way of life, and that is a terrible, and emotional, reality to face,â [one state official said](http://secure-web.cisco.com/1_tRM6HBY6EwKu7mvGrG23MSX97cwLfmySPPikYtScLd6uyvbIIOeZnNNjeJGm3Bwmlsgj87NbNt3M1_9ippbnWu9WEXdVpTwpYPpRCQHBXumVgpP5RMBWaAsdidEsQnhVDxr8vVZJGZCnI81bnTvSBckwGlxIH31Gl7WL0aitYszQ-_VSZBOf6PqlG1da2i8w21lnLyPjO5hLrMY38L6KlBIvDyM9fULTllxvepiXOGMmWlbGlCbXQcUicPursrSARM3TBALJ4eTlDiOzR_dy_LPLC3hlsSwJHjwKY-FmhShjE3oBu2u8TwQ0S98SqMLEjuvAkAPEVSy6o6heTZgStH5Szp-kReFmy_YlEpO1A3_nVgjaN1r40ot220rAb4r/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2017-12-22%2Flouisiana-sinking-fast-prepares-to-empty-out-its-coastal-plain)); from Hawaii, where, according to a new study, thirty-eight miles of coastal roads will become impassable in the next few decades; and from Jakarta, a city with a population of ten million, where a rising Java Sea had flooded the streets. In the first days of 2018, a norâeaster flooded downtown Boston; dumpsters and cars floated through the financial district. âIf anyone wants to question global warming, just see where the flood zones are,â Marty Walsh, the mayor of Boston, told reporters. âSome of those zones did not flood thirty years ago.â\n\nAccording to a study from the United Kingdomâs National Oceanography Centre last summer, the damage caused by rising sea levels will cost the world as much as fourteen trillion dollars a year by 2100, if the U.N. targets arenât met. âLike it or not, we will retreat from most of the worldâs non-urban shorelines in the not very distant future,â Orrin Pilkey, an expert on sea levels at Duke University, wrote in his book âRetreat from a Rising Sea.â âWe can plan now and retreat in a strategic and calculated fashion, or we can worry about it later and retreat in tactical disarray in response to devastating storms. In other words, we can walk away methodically, or we can flee in panic.â\n\nBut itâs not clear where to go. As with the rising seas, rising temperatures have begun to narrow the margins of our inhabitation, this time in the hot continental interiors. Nine of the ten deadliest heat waves in human history have occurred since 2000\\. In India, the rise in temperature since 1960 (about one degree Fahrenheit) has increased the chance of mass heat-related deaths by a hundred and fifty per cent. The summer of 2018 was the hottest ever measured in certain areas. For a couple of days in June, temperatures in cities in Pakistan and Iran peaked at slightly above a hundred and twenty-nine degrees Fahrenheit, the highest reliably recorded temperatures ever measured. The same heat wave, nearer the shore of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, combined triple-digit temperatures with soaring humidity levels to produce a heat index of more than a hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit. June 26th was the warmest night in history, with the mercury in one Omani city remaining above a hundred and nine degrees Fahrenheit until morning. In July, a heat wave in Montreal killed more than seventy people, and Death Valley, which often sets American records, registered the hottest month ever seen on our planet. Africa recorded its highest temperature in June, the Korean Peninsula in July, and Europe in August. The _Times_ reported that, in Algeria, employees at a petroleum plant walked off the job as the temperature neared a hundred and twenty-four degrees. âWe couldnât keep up,â one worker told the reporter. âIt was impossible to do the work.â\n\nThis was no illusion; some of the world is becoming too hot for humans. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, increased heat and humidity have reduced the amount of work people can do outdoors by ten per cent, a figure that is predicted to double by 2050\\. About a decade ago, Australian and American researchers, setting out to determine the highest survivable so-called âwet-bulbâ temperature, concluded that when temperatures passed thirty-five degrees Celsius (ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit) and the humidity was higher than ninety per cent, even in âwell-ventilated shaded conditions,â sweating slows down, and humans can survive only âfor a few hours, the exact length of time being determined by individual physiology.â\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5bee0dd1132d895f517cf7be]||||||\n+++\n\nAs the planet warms, a crescent-shaped area encompassing parts of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the North China Plain, where about 1.5 billion people (a fifth of humanity) live, is at high risk of such temperatures in the next half century. Across this belt, extreme heat waves that currently happen once every generation could, by the end of the century, become âannual events with temperatures close to the threshold for several weeks each year, which could lead to famine and mass migration.â By 2070, tropical regions that now get one day of truly oppressive humid heat a year can expect between a hundred and two hundred and fifty days, if the current levels of greenhouse-gas emissions continue. According to Radley Horton, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, most people would ârun into terrible problemsâ before then. The effects, he added, will be âtransformative for all areas of human endeavorâeconomy, agriculture, military, recreation.â\n\nHumans share the planet with many other creatures, of course. We have already managed to kill off sixty per cent of the worldâs wildlife since 1970 by destroying their habitats, and now higher temperatures are starting to take their toll. A new study found that peak-dwelling birds were going extinct; as temperatures climb, the birds can no longer find relief on higher terrain. Coral reefs, rich in biodiversity, may soon be a tenth of their current size.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs some people flee humidity and rising sea levels, others will be forced to relocate in order to find enough water to survive. In late 2017, a study led by Manoj Joshi, of the University of East Anglia, found that, by 2050, if temperatures rise by two degrees a quarter of the earth will experience serious drought and desertification. The early signs are clear: SÃ£o Paulo came within days of running out of water last year, as did Cape Town this spring. In the fall, a record drought in Germany lowered the level of the Elbe to below twenty inches and reduced the corn harvest by forty per cent. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research concluded in a recent study that, as the number of days that reach eighty-six degrees Fahrenheit or higher increases, corn and soybean yields across the U.S. grain belt could fall by between twenty-two and forty-nine per cent. Weâve already overpumped the aquifers that lie beneath most of the worldâs breadbaskets; without the means to irrigate, we may encounter a repeat of the nineteen-thirties, when droughts and deep plowing led to the Dust Bowlâthis time with no way of fixing the problem. Back then, the Okies fled to California, but California is no longer a green oasis. A hundred million trees died in the record drought that gripped the Golden State for much of this decade. The dead limbs helped spread the waves of fire, as scientists earlier this year warned that they could.\n\nThirty years ago, some believed that warmer temperatures would expand the field of play, turning the Arctic into the new Midwest. As Rex Tillerson, then the C.E.O. of Exxon, cheerfully put it in 2012, âChanges to weather patterns that move crop production areas aroundâweâll adapt to that.â But there is no rich topsoil in the far North; instead, the ground is underlaid with permafrost, which can be found beneath a fifth of the Northern Hemisphere. As the permafrost melts, it releases more carbon into the atmosphere. The thawing layer cracks roads, tilts houses, and uproots trees to create what scientists call âdrunken forests.â Ninety scientists who released a joint report in 2017 concluded that economic losses from a warming Arctic could approach ninety trillion dollars in the course of the century, considerably outweighing whatever savings may have resulted from shorter shipping routes as the Northwest Passage unfreezes.\n\nChurchill, Manitoba, on the edge of the Hudson Bay, in Canada, is connected to the rest of the country by a single rail line. In the spring of 2017, record floods washed away much of the track. OmniTrax, which owns the line, tried to cancel its contract with the government, declaring what lawyers call a âforce majeure,â an unforeseen event beyond its responsibility. âTo fix things in this era of climate changeâwell, itâs fixed, but you donât count on it being the fix forever,â an engineer for the company explained at a media briefing in July. This summer, the Canadian government reopened the rail at a cost of a hundred and seventeen million dollarsâabout a hundred and ninety thousand dollars per Churchill resident. There is no reason to think the fix will last, and every reason to believe that our world will keep contracting.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAll this has played out more or less as scientists warned, albeit faster. What has defied expectations is the slowness of the response. The climatologist James Hansen testified before Congress about the dangers of human-caused climate change thirty years ago. Since then, carbon emissions have increased with each year except 2009 (the height of the global recession) and the newest data show that 2018 will set another record. Simple inertia and the human tendency to prioritize short-term gains have played a role, but the fossil-fuel industryâs contribution has been by far the most damaging. Alex Steffen, an environmental writer, coined the term âpredatory delayâ to describe âthe blocking or slowing of needed change, in order to make money off unsustainable, unjust systems in the meantime.â The behavior of the oil companies, which have pulled off perhaps the most consequential deception in mankindâs history, is a prime example.\n\nAs journalists at InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles _Times_ have revealed since 2015, Exxon, the worldâs largest oil company, understood that its product was contributing to climate change a decade before Hansen testified. In July, 1977, JamesÂ F. Black, one of Exxonâs senior scientists, addressed many of the companyâs top leaders in New York, explaining the earliest research on the greenhouse effect. âThere is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon-dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels,â he said, according to a written version of the speech which was later recorded, and which was obtained by InsideClimate News. In 1978, speaking to the companyâs executives, Black estimated that a doubling of the carbon-dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by between two and three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), and as much as ten degrees Celsius (eighteen degrees Fahrenheit) at the poles.\n\nExxon spent millions of dollars researching the problem. It outfitted an oil tanker, the Esso Atlantic, with CO~2~ detectors to measure how fast the oceans could absorb excess carbon, and hired mathematicians to build sophisticated climate models. By 1982, they had concluded that even the companyâs earlier estimates were probably too low. In a private corporate primer, they wrote that heading off global warming and âpotentially catastrophic eventsâ would ârequire major reductions in fossil fuel combustion.â\n\nAn investigation by the L.A. _Times_ revealed that Exxon executives took these warnings seriously. Ken Croasdale, a senior researcher for the companyâs Canadian subsidiary, led a team that investigated the positive and negative effects of warming on Exxonâs Arctic operations. In 1991, he found that greenhouse gases were rising due to the burning of fossil fuels. âNobody disputes this fact,â he said. The following year, he wrote that âglobal warming can only help lower exploration and development costsâ in the Beaufort Sea. Drilling season in the Arctic, he correctly predicted, would increase from two months to as many as five months. At the same time, he said, the rise in the sea level could threaten onshore infrastructure and create bigger waves that would damage offshore drilling structures. Thawing permafrost could make the earth buckle and slide under buildings and pipelines. As a result of these findings, Exxon and other major oil companies began laying plans to move into the Arctic, and started to build their new drilling platforms with higher decks, to compensate for the anticipated rises in sea level.\n\nThe implications of the exposÃ©s were startling. Not only did Exxon and other companies know that scientists like Hansen were right; they used his *NASA*{: .small} climate models to figure out how low their drilling costs in the Arctic would eventually fall. Had Exxon and its peers passed on what they knew to the public, geological history would look very different today. The problem of climate change would not be solved, but the crisis would, most likely, now be receding. In 1989, an international ban on chlorine-containing man-made chemicals that had been eroding the earthâs ozone layer went into effect. Last month, researchers reported that the ozone layer was on track to fully heal by 2060\\. But that was a relatively easy fight, because the chemicals in question were not central to the worldâs economy, and the manufacturers had readily available substitutes to sell. In the case of global warming, the culprit is fossil fuel, the most lucrative commodity on earth, and so the companies responsible took a different tack.\n\nA document uncovered by the L.A. _Times_ showed that, a month after Hansenâs testimony, in 1988, an unnamed Exxon âpublic affairs managerâ issued an internal memo recommending that the company âemphasize the uncertaintyâ in the scientific data about climate change. Within a few years, Exxon, Chevron, Shell, Amoco, and others had joined the Global Climate Coalition, âto coordinate business participation in the international policy debateâ on global warming. The G.C.C. coÃ¶rdinated with the National Coal Association and the American Petroleum Institute on a campaign, via letters and telephone calls, to prevent a tax on fossil fuels, and produced a video in which the agency insisted that more carbon dioxide would âend world hungerâ by promoting plant growth. With such efforts, it ginned up opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, the first global initiative to address climate change.\n\nIn October, 1997, two months before the Kyoto meeting, Lee Raymond, Exxonâs president and C.E.O., who had overseen the science department that in the nineteen-eighties produced the findings about climate change, gave a speech in Beijing to the World Petroleum Congress, in which he maintained that the earth was actually cooling. The idea that cutting fossil-fuel emissions could have an effect on the climate, he said, defied common sense. âIt is highly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century will be affected whether policies are enacted now, or twenty years from now,â he went on. Exxonâs own scientists had already shown each of these premises to be wrong.\n\nOn a December morning in 1997 at the Kyoto Convention Center, after a long night of negotiation, the developed nations reached a tentative accord on climate change. Exhausted delegates lay slumped on couches in the corridor, or on the floor in their suits, but most of them were grinning. Imperfect and limited though the agreement was, it seemed that momentum had gathered behind fighting climate change. But as I watched the delegates cheering and clapping, an American lobbyist, who had been coÃ¶rdinating much of the opposition to the accord, turned to me and said, âI canât wait to get back to Washington, where weâve got this under control.â\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5bee0dd2050708639d6e1405]||||||\n+++\n\nHe was right. On January 29, 2001, nine days after GeorgeÂ W. Bush was inaugurated, Lee Raymond visited his old friend Vice-President Dick Cheney, who had just stepped down as the C.E.O. of the oil-drilling giant Halliburton. Cheney helped persuade Bush to abandon his campaign promise to treat carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Within the year, Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant for Bush, had produced an internal memo that made a doctrine of the strategy that the G.C.C. had hit on a decade earlier. âVoters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community,â Luntz wrote in the memo, which was obtained by the Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based organization. âShould the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate.â\n\nThe strategy of muddling the publicâs impression of climate science has proved to be highly effective. In 2017, polls found that almost ninety per cent of Americans did not know that there was a scientific consensus on global warming. Raymond retired in 2006, after the company posted the biggest corporate profits in history, and his final annual salary was four hundred million dollars. His successor, Rex Tillerson, signed a five-hundred-billion-dollar deal to explore for oil in the rapidly thawing Russian Arctic, and in 2012 was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship. In 2016, Tillerson, at his last shareholder meeting before he briefly joined the Trump Administration as Secretary of State, said, âThe world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not.â\n\nItâs by no means clear whether Exxonâs deception and obfuscation are illegal. The company has long maintained that it âhas tracked the scientific consensus on climate change, and its research on the issue has been published in publicly available peer-reviewed journals.â The First Amendment preserves oneâs right to lie, although, in October, New York State Attorney General BarbaraÂ D. Underwood filed suit against Exxon for lying to investors, which _is_ a crime. What is certain is that the industryâs campaign cost us the efforts of the human generation that might have made the crucial difference in the climate fight.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nExxonâs behavior is shocking, but not entirely surprising. Philip Morris lied about the effects of cigarette smoking before the government stood up to Big Tobacco. The mystery that historians will have to unravel is what went so wrong in our governance and our culture that we have done, essentially, nothing to stand up to the fossil-fuel industry.\n\nThere are undoubtedly myriad intellectual, psychological, and political sources for our inaction, but I cannot help thinking that the influence of Ayn Rand, the Russian Ã©migrÃ© novelist, may have played a role. Randâs disquisitions on the âvirtue of selfishnessâ and unbridled capitalism are admired by many American politicians and economistsâPaul Ryan, Tillerson, Mike Pompeo, Andrew Puzder, and Donald Trump, among them. Trump, who has called âThe Fountainheadâ his favorite book, said that the novel ârelates to business and beauty and life and inner emotions. That book relates toÂ .Â .Â . everything.â Long after Randâs death, in 1982, the libertarian gospel of the novel continues to sway our politics: Government is bad. Solidarity is a trap. Taxes are theft. The Koch brothers, whose enormous fortune derives in large part from the mining and refining of oil and gas, have peddled a similar message, broadening the efforts that Exxon-funded groups like the Global Climate Coalition spearheaded in the late nineteen-eighties.\n\nFossil-fuel companies and electric utilities, often led by Koch-linked groups, have put up fierce resistance to change. In Kansas, Koch allies helped turn mandated targets for renewable energy into voluntary commitments. In Wisconsin, Scott Walkerâs administration prohibited state land officials from talking about climate change. In North Carolina, the state legislature, in conjunction with real-estate interests, effectively banned policymakers from using scientific estimates of sea-level rise in the coastal-planning process. Earlier this year, Americans for Prosperity, the most important Koch front group, waged a campaign against new bus routes and light-rail service in Tennessee, invoking human liberty. âIf someone has the freedom to go where they want, do what they want, theyâre not going to choose public transit,â a spokeswoman for the group explained. In Florida, an anti-renewable-subsidy ballot measure invoked the âRights of Electricity Consumers Regarding Solar Energy Choice.â\n\nSuch efforts help explain why, in 2017, the growth of American residential solar installations came to a halt even before March, 2018, when President Trump imposed a thirty-per-cent tariff on solar panels, and why the number of solar jobs fell in the U.S. for the first time since the industryâs great expansion began, a decade earlier. In February, at the Department of Energy, Rick Perryâwho once skipped his own arraignment on two felony charges, which were eventually dismissed, in order to attend a Koch brothers eventâissued a new projection in which he announced that the U.S. would go on emitting carbon at current levels through 2050; this means that our nation would use up all the planetâs remaining carbon budget if we plan on meeting the 1.5-degree target. Skepticism about the scientific consensus, Perry told the media in 2017, is a sign of a âwise, intellectually engaged person.â\n\nOf all the environmental reversals made by the Trump Administration, the most devastating was its decision, last year, to withdraw from the Paris accords, making the U.S., the largest single historical source of carbon, the only nation not engaged in international efforts to control it. As the Washington _Post_ reported, the withdrawal was the result of a collaborative venture. Among the anti-government ideologues and fossil-fuel lobbyists responsible was Myron Ebell, who was at Trumpâs side in the Rose Garden during the withdrawal announcement, and who, at Frontiers of Freedom, had helped run a âcomplex influence campaignâ in support of the tobacco industry. Ebell is a director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which was founded in 1984 to advance âthe principles of limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty,â and which funds the Cooler Heads Coalition, âan informal and ad-hoc group focused on dispelling the myths of global warming,â of which Ebell is the chairman. Also instrumental were the Heartland Institute and the Koch brothersâ Americans for Prosperity. After Trumpâs election, these groups sent a letter reminding him of his campaign pledge to pull America out. The C.E.I. ran a TV spot: âMr. President, donât listen to the swamp. Keep your promise.â And, despite the objections of most of his advisers, he did. The coalition had used its power to slow us down precisely at the moment when we needed to speed up. As a result, the particular politics of one country for one half-century will have changed the geological history of the earth.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWe are on a path to self-destruction, and yet there is nothing inevitable about our fate. Solar panels and wind turbines are now among the least expensive ways to produce energy. Storage batteries are cheaper and more efficient than ever. We could move quickly if we chose to, but weâd need to opt for solidarity and coÃ¶rdination on a global scale. The chances of that look slim. In Russia, the second-largest petrostate after the U.S., Vladimir Putin believes that âclimate change could be tied to some global cycles on Earth or even of planetary significance.â Saudi Arabia, the third-largest petrostate, tried to water down the recent I.P.C.C. report. Jair Bolsonaro, the newly elected President of Brazil, has vowed to institute policies that would dramatically accelerate the deforestation of the Amazon, the worldâs largest rain forest. Meanwhile, Exxon recently announced a plan to spend a million dollarsâabout a hundredth of what the company spends each month in search of new oil and gasâto back the fight for a carbon tax of forty dollars a ton. At a press conference, some of the I.P.C.C.âs authors laughed out loud at the idea that such a tax would, this late in the game, have sufficient impact.\n\nThe possibility of swift change lies in people coming together in movements large enough to shift the Zeitgeist. In recent years, despairing at the slow progress, Iâve been one of many to protest pipelines and to call attention to Big Oilâs deceptions. The movement is growing. Since 2015, when four hundred thousand people marched in the streets of New York before the Paris climate talks, activistsâoften led by indigenous groups and communities living on the front lines of climate changeâhave blocked pipelines, forced the cancellation of new coal mines, helped keep the major oil companies out of the American Arctic, and persuaded dozens of cities to commit to one-hundred-per-cent renewable energy.\n\nEach of these efforts has played out in the shadow of the industryâs unflagging campaign to maximize profits and prevent change. Voters in Washington State were initially supportive of a measure on last monthâs ballot which would have imposed the nationâs first carbon taxâa modest fee that won support from such figures as Bill Gates. But the major oil companies spent record sums to defeat it. In Colorado, a similarly modest referendum that would have forced frackers to move their rigs away from houses and schools went down after the oil industry outspent citizen groups forty to one. This fall, Californiaâs legislators committed to using only renewable energy by 2045, which was a great victory in the worldâs fifth-largest economy. But the governor refused to stop signing new permits for oil wells, even in the middle of the stateâs largest cities, where asthma rates are high.\n\nNew kinds of activism keep springing up. In Sweden this fall, a one-person school boycott by a fifteen-year-old girl named Greta Thunberg helped galvanize attention across Scandinavia. At the end of October, a new British group, Extinction Rebellionâits name both a reflection of the dire science and a potentially feisty responseâannounced plans for a campaign of civil disobedience. Last week, fifty-one young people were arrested in Nancy Pelosiâs office for staging a sit-in, demanding that the Democrats embrace a âGreen New Dealâ that would address the global climate crisis with policies to create jobs in renewable energy. They may have picked a winning issue: several polls have shown that even Republicans favor more government support for solar panels. This battle is epic and undecided. If we miss the two-degree target, we will fight to prevent a rise of three degrees, and then four. Itâs a long escalator down to Hell.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5bee0dd11ea357631995581c]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nLast June, I went to Cape Canaveral to watch Elon Muskâs Falcon 9 rocket lift off. When the moment came, it was as Iâd always imagined: the clouds of steam venting in the minutes before launch, the immensely bright column of flame erupting. With remarkable slowness, the rocket began to rise, the grip of gravity yielding to the force of its engines. It is the most awesome technological spectacle human beings have produced.\n\nMusk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson are among the billionaires who have spent some of their fortunes on space travelâa last-ditch effort to expand the human zone of habitability. In November, 2016, Stephen Hawking gave humanity a deadline of a thousand years to leave Earth. Six months later, he revised the timetable to a century. In June, 2017, he told an audience that âspreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves.â He continued, âEarth is under threat from so many areas that it is difficult for me to be positive.â\n\nBut escaping the wreckage is, almost certainly, a fantasy. Even if astronauts did cross the thirty-four million miles to Mars, theyâd need to go underground to survive there. To what end? The multimillion-dollar attempts at building a âbiosphereâ in the Southwestern desert in 1991 ended in abject failure. Kim Stanley Robinson, the author of a trilogy of novels about the colonization of Mars, recently called such projects a âmoral hazard.â âPeople think if we fuck up here on Earth we can always go to Mars or the stars,â he said. âItâs pernicious.â\n\nThe dream of interplanetary colonization also distracts us from acknowledging the unbearable beauty of the planet we already inhabit. The day before the launch, I went on a tour of the vast grounds of the Kennedy Space Center with *NASA*{: .small}âs public-affairs officer, Greg Harland, and the biologist Don Dankert. Iâd been warned beforehand by other *NASA*{: .small} officials not to broach the topic of global warming; in any event, *NASA*{: .small}âs predicament became obvious as soon as we climbed up on a dune overlooking Launch Complex 39, from which the Apollo missions left for the moon, and where any future Mars mission would likely begin. The launchpad is a quarter of a mile from the oceanâa perfect location, in the sense that, if something goes wrong, the rockets will fall into the sea, but not so perfect, since that sea is now rising. *NASA*{: .small} started worrying about this sometime after the turn of the century, and formed a Dune Vulnerability Team.\n\nIn 2012, Hurricane Sandy, even at a distance of a couple of hundred miles, churned up waves strong enough to break through the barrier of dunes along the Atlantic shoreline of the Space Center and very nearly swamped the launch complexes. Dankert had millions of cubic yards of sand excavated from a nearby Air Force base, and saw to it that a hundred and eighty thousand native shrubs were planted to hold the sand in place. So far, the new dunes have yielded little ground to storms and hurricanes. But what impressed me more than the dunes was the menâs deep appreciation of their landscape. âKennedy Space Center shares real estate with the Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge,â Harland said. âWe use less than ten per cent for our industrial purposes.â\n\nâWhen you look at the beach, itâs like eighteen-seventies Floridaâthe longest undisturbed stretch on the Atlantic Coast,â Dankert said. âWe launch people into space from the middle of a wildlife refuge. Thatâs amazing.â\n\nThe two men talked for a long time about their favorite local speciesâthe brown pelicans that were skimming the ocean, the Florida scrub jays. While rebuilding the dunes, they carefully bucket-trapped and relocated dozens of gopher tortoises. Before I left, they drove me half an hour across the swamp to a pond near the Space Centerâs headquarters building, just to show me some alligators. Menacing snouts were visible beneath the water, but I was more interested in the sign that had been posted at each corner of the pond explaining that the alligators were native species, not pets. âPutting any food in the water for any reason will cause them to become accustomed to people and possibly dangerous,â it went on, adding that, if that should happen, âthey must be removed and destroyed.â\n\nSomething about the sign moved me tremendously. It would have been easy enough to poison the pond, just as it would have been easy enough to bulldoze the dunes without a thought for the tortoises. But *NASA*{: .small} hadnât done so, because of a long series of laws that draw on an emerging understanding of who we are. In 1867, John Muir, one of the first Western environmentalists, walked from Louisville, Kentucky, to Florida, a trip that inspired his first heretical thoughts about the meaning of being human. âThe world, we are told, was made especially for manâa presumption not supported by all the facts,â Muir wrote in his diary. âA numerous class of men are painfully astonished whenever they find anything, living or dead, in all Godâs universe, which they cannot eat or render in some way what they call useful to themselves.â Muirâs proof that this self-centeredness was misguided was the alligator, which he could hear roaring in the Florida swamp as he camped nearby, and which clearly caused man mostly trouble. But these animals were wonderful nonetheless, Muir decidedâremarkable creatures perfectly adapted to their landscape. âI have better thoughts of those alligators now that Iâve seen them at home,â he wrote. In his diary, he addressed the creatures directly: âHonorable representatives of the great saurian of an older creation, may you long enjoy your lilies and rushes, and be blessed now and then with a mouthful of terror-stricken man by way of dainty.â\n\nThat evening, Harland and Dankert drew a crude map to help me find the beach, north of Patrick Air Force Base and south of the spot where, in 1965, Barbara Eden emerged from her bottle to greet her astronaut at the start of the TV series âI Dream of Jeannie.â There, they said, I could wait out the hours until the pre-dawn rocket launch and perhaps spot a loggerhead sea turtle coming ashore to lay her eggs. And so I sat on the sand. The beach was deserted, and under a near-full moon I watched as a turtle trundled from the sea and lumbered deliberately to a spot near the dune, where she used her powerful legs to excavate a pit. She spent an hour laying eggs, and even from thirty yards away you could hear her heavy breathing in between the whispers of the waves. And then, having covered her clutch, she tracked back to the ocean, in the fashion of others like her for the past hundred and twenty million years.Â â¦\n\nAn earlier version of this piece misstated the year that Hurricane Sandy occurred.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5910ae34dd6207318b5dbb76","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reflections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reflections"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a78b6c4c222f03a82e0e","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/bill-mckibben","email":"","name":"Bill McKibben","socialMedia":[],"title":"Bill McKibben, a former New Yorker staff writer, is a founder of the grassroots climate campaign 350.org and the Schumann Distinguished Scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College.

Among the bears preparing for hibernation at [Katmai National Park](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/bear-cams-captivating-unedited-zen), a female named [Beadnose](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/10/9/17955432/fat-bear-week-katmai-national-park-409-747-salmon) became famous for being the most gloriously round. There was the [baby raccoon who](https://twitter.com/red__RD/status/1074347729050951682) scaled a skyscraper in St. Paul, âMission Impossibleâ style, stopping occasionally for naps in window ledges along the way. (It was trapped, released, and promptly made the subject of a childrenâs book.) Stories from the animal world offer reliable moments of escapismâthe ones we see in viral videos are usually cute, or tame, or strange and majestic, and glimpsed from a safe distance. But the animal stories that resonated most with me this year were the ones that hinted at a more ominous trend: that we humans are encroaching on nature in ways both glaring and subtle, putting the human and animal worlds into ever more intimate, and ever more fraught, contact. \n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5c1fb87a8822322ea4b3bd0d]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe most influential animal of the year might be the [unfortunate sea turtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wH878t78bw) who got a straw stuckâreally, deeply, seriously stuckâup his nose. In an uncomfortable ten-minute video posted to YouTube, a marine biologist slowly extracts the straw, which is brown and crumpled and disgusting. The turtleâs nose bleeds, and throughout the ordeal, it opens its mouth as if to bite the biologistâs handâor howl in pain. The video, filmed in 2015, in Costa Rica, became part of this yearâs debate over plastic straws and was used by proponents of straw bans to show how such a small object, used and disposed of without a thought, can cause substantial suffering down the line. \n\nA [baby bear](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/problematic-viral-video-persistent-baby-bear/574990/) became an overnight Internet star when it was captured in a video that looked, at first, like a sweet inspirational tale. In aerial drone footage, the cub was shown repeatedly slipping down the side of a snowy ledge and trying mightily to make its way to the top, where its mother waited. Ultimately, the cub prevailed, and the video was embraced on social media as a tribute to the power of perseverance. But then drone operators and ecologists began weighing in: the drone that took the video had likely alarmed the bears; you can see the mother bear swatting the air as the drone flies closer. The machineâs operator, in chasing the bears for footage, had potentially driven them into a dangerous situation. Suddenly, the viral cub was transformed from a feel-good fable into a cautionary tale about how humans can imperil animals just by trying to get a good look at them. \n\nThe most devastating news from the animal kingdom came from Puget Sound, where a wild orca named Tahlequah carried the body of her dead calf for a total of seventeen days. Orcas, famously intelligent, have [a long history](https://newrepublic.com/article/150740/free-whales) of being captured, trained, and anthropomorphized. Their social groups are highly sophisticated, with older females living for decades, sometimes to the age of a hundred, training and leading multiple generations within their pods. The calf was born emaciated, without the blubber that orcas need to survive in cold watersâan emblem of the plight of the critically endangered Puget Sound orcas, who are threatened by a drop in the availability of the Chinook salmon that are their main food source. Orcas and their relatives have been known to carry the bodies of their dead, but such a long âgrief tourâ had never before been observed. \n\nDuring a year that saw the stripping away of environmental protections, one legal victory for wilderness stands out. This fall, the first grizzly-bear hunt in the more than forty years was scheduled in the area around Yellowstone National Park. The local bears had been listed as endangered in the seventies, when there were around a hundred and twenty-five individuals living in and around the park. There are now around seven hundred. After the bears lost their protected status, in 2017, the states of Idaho and Wyoming scheduled trophy hunts for the fall of the 2018\\. But, as a result of a lawsuit brought by the Crow Indian tribe and a group of environmental organizations, the [hunt was cancelled](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/science/yellowstone-grizzly-hunt.html). The judge ruled that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had used analysis that was âarbitrary and capriciousâ when it revoked the grizzliesâ status, and that the population needed to be left to continue to recover.\n\nNo member of the animal kingdom was fawned over in 2018 quite like the Mandarin duck, also known as [the hot duck](https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/everyone-loves-the-hot-duck.html), Central Parkâs avian celebrity (and, according to Naomi Fry, one of [2018âs notable good men](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2018-in-review/the-year-in-good-men)). He has it all, really: a glamorous countenance with an array of jewel-tone feathers that his mallard peers can only dream of, a mysterious origin story suggesting hints of adventure (the species is native to East Asia and no local person or zoo has reported him missing), a lively troupe of admirers who track his movements, and, to top it all off, an ombre-purple crest. Some birders have [expressed worries](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/nyregion/hot-duck-mandarin-central-park.html) that the fans flocking to see him are disturbing the pondâs peaceâthe manager of a popular Twitter account for New York birders aroused ire by attempting to lure the duck with a soft pretzel, breaking with bird-watcher protocol. But with the many novel ways that humans have found to interfere with wild animals, I think we can leave offering snacks to ducks off the list. This fall, birders sometimes waited, nervous and disappointed, when he would disappear from the Central Park pond that had become his new habitat. All were relieved to discover that he was just going to New Jersey.    \n\nMy favorite animal of all this year was a seal in New Zealand, who was [caught on video](https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2018/sep/27/seal-slaps-kayaker-in-the-face-with-an-octopus-video) slapping a kayaker in the face with the body of an octopus, in a truly riveting moment of marine-mammal sass. Sure, biologists have explained that seals sometimes fling octopuses against the waterâs surface to sever their tentacles to eat, and that the kayakerâs slap was incidental. But Iâd argue that, on a cosmic level, the seal was dishing out some well-deserved animal-kingdom justice, fair dues for what humans have done to that sea turtle and that bear cub, not to mention the rest of the planet.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a244997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Animals","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"animals"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a397f5b30646d05ec","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environmentalism","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environmentalism"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ae56e652c9027465e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wildlife","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wildlife"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a41e4c73c088d7754","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2018 Year in Review","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2018-year-in-review"}],"sections":[{"id":"5bfec45e7556b72d483911ef","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2018 in Review","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2018-in-review"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7d92e2e17730741c744","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-riederer","email":"","name":"Rachel Riederer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Rachel Riederer is a member of The New Yorkerâs editorial staff.

(KanuÊ»uhiwa Thomas is an alias.) âI donât have any type of support system,â Thomas told me. âIâm still trying to finish my schooling, which is really important to me because a lot of girls here donât finish their educationâthey just get pregnant and maybe get married and have kids and have to live off the system. Iâm just kind of adamant about making sure I can take care of a child before I have one.â\n\nHawaii has one of the most liberal abortion policies in the country, but, like many rural and geographically expansive states, services are hard to come by. At the time, only two of the Hawaiian Islands had abortion providersâMaui, which is a hundred miles from the Big Island, where Thomas lives, and Oahu, two hundred miles away.  She began to make phone calls. âAll I wanted was someone who could help me do it,â she said. âI was afraid they were going to scold me on the phone and hang up.â Eventually, she heard about a service called TelAbortion, which uses video conferencing to connect doctor and patient. Once an ultrasound confirms that the pregnancy is no more than ten weeks along and the TelAbortion physician gives the O.K., the patient is sent medications that, essentially, induce a miscarriage, ending the pregnancy.\n\nTelemedicineâobtaining medical services over the phone or through the Internetâis not a new phenomenon. In the U.S., it began to take off in the [late nineteen-fifties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3089841/), and a [2016 federal grant to increase access to health care](https://www.nuemd.com/news/2017/01/04/quick-look-history-telemedicine) in rural areas has made it more mainstream. Medical abortion (as distinct from surgical) relies on a drug protocol that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000\\. What makes TelAbortion unique is the coupling of the two technologies. It enables a woman to terminate a pregnancy in the privacy of her own home, but with medical oversight. \n\nThe F.D.A. protocol, which involves two drugsâmifepristone and misoprostolânow accounts for [thirty-one per cent of all non-hospital abortions](https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/medication-abortion) in the United States, according to a 2014 study from the Guttmacher Institue, a nonprofit reproductive-health research and advocacy organization. When the two medications are taken together, they work between ninety-five and ninety-nine per cent of the time, depending on gestational age. Medical abortion has also proved to be safe. According to the Guttmacher Institute, complications from medical abortion result in hospitalization [0\\.4 per cent](https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/medication-abortion) of the time. By contrast, a study published in the [*New England Journal of Medicine*](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb1612526), in 2017, found that women are fourteen times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than from taking mifepristone for a medical abortion. (Mifepristone can be taken by itself, but it is [more effective](https://www.webmd.com/women/news/20000928/medical-abortion-regimen-is-not-simple-one) taken in tandem with misopristol.)\n\nThe TelAbortion service that Thomas hoped to use is part of a five-state trial that the reproductive-health initiative Gynuity launched, in 2016, in response to the ever-diminishing availability of abortion services in the United States. As of the end of January, two hundred and eighty-three women had received TelAbortions, a hundred and fifty-eight of them in Hawaii. The Gynuity trial, which is also available in New York, Oregon, Washington, and Maine, is not the first or the only medical-abortion protocol. More typically, women are required to visit a clinic and take the abortifacient drugs in the presence of a clinician. What makes the TelAbortion protocol so unusual is that once a woman consults with a physician, she is on her own. \n\nDr. Bliss Kaneshiro, an ob-gyn at the University of Hawaii, who is one of four physicians in her practice participating in the Gynuity trial, told me that consulting with patients over the Internet has been surprisingly intimate. âI was worried that the video visits wouldnât be as personal as they are in the office, but Iâve found itâs very personal,â she said. âI get to glimpse into peopleâs lives. I see kids in the background and a partner listening. I see patients in their bedrooms. I get a sense of how this is playing out in their lives.â\n\nSo far, Kaneshiro has done about eighty telemedical abortions. âSo many patients have vocalized how much theyâve preferred this de-medicalized process,â she said. One patient who lived a mile from the office simply preferred to communicate screen-to-screen. But most of the women in the trial, like Thomas, are hampered by geography, finding it expensive and often logistically impossible to access distant services. âI didnât have to get a hotel or buy a flight to Oahu,â Thomas told me. âI got to be home, which was not just financially efficient, it was just comforting and private.â The total cost of her abortion was less than three hundred dollars.\n\nLeah Coplon, who runs the Gynuity trial in Maine, said, âFor some folks, itâs a scheduling issue. Even though we have very good access here in Maine, it still can be hard if somebody works nights or they only have child care on weekends.â This flexibility is vital, Coplon told me, but so is the opportunity to avoid the gauntlet of protesters who routinely show up at clinics that provide abortion services. \n\nAlthough the five states in the TelAbortion trial have some of the most accommodating abortion laws in the country, Gynuity is only able to run the trial with a waiver from the F.D.A., which has put onerous restrictions on the distribution of abortifacients. Mifeprex, the trade name of mifepristone, is one of only [seventy-five](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/rems/index.cfm) F.D.A.-approved medications (out of thousands) controlled through its Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (*REMS*{: .small}), and only one of fifty with its most stringent restrictions. [According to the F.D.A.](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/REMS/default.htm), *REMS*{: .small}, which regulates such drugs as Clozapine, an antipsychotic medication, and Thalidomide, which is known to cause birth defects, is a drug-safety program for âmedications with serious safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks.âÂ The *REMS*{: .small} mandates that Mifeprex only be dispensed to a patient in a clinic, medical office, or hospital. A doctor canât send a patient to her local pharmacy with a prescription for the medication, because pharmacies are not allowed to carry it. This limits the ability of physicians to administer the medication and of patients to obtain it, despite nearly twenty years of evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy, which is why the [American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists](https://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/Statements/2016/ACOG-Statement-on-Medication-Abortion?IsMobileSet=false) has recommended eliminating the *REMS*{: .small} altogether. [An F.D.A. panel of experts](https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/medication-abortion) recommended [eliminating](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2016/020687Orig1s020RiskR.pdf) one aspect of the *REMS*{:.small} in 2016 when the Mifeprex *REMS*{: .small} came up for review. It was overruled by the F.D.A. commissioner, an Obama appointee. \n\nIn 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the F.D.A. over the *REMS*{: .small} on behalf of the California Academy of Family Physicians; the Society of Family Planning; Pharmacistsâ Planning Services, Inc.; and Dr. Graham Chelius, the chief of staff at Kauai Veterans Memorial Hospital, who is the named plaintiff. âWhile many of my patients have much-wanted pregnancies, a substantial percentage choose to end their pregnancies and come to me seeking abortion care,â he wrote in his sworn testimony. âMost of these women are medically eligible for the FDA-approved medication abortion regimen.â The problem,  according to Cheliusâs lawyer  at the A.C.L.U.âs Reproductive Freedom Project, Julia Kaye, is that the *REMS*{:.small} makes this impossible because ârather than writing a prescription for the patient to fill at a retail pharmacy, you have to get multiple layers of approval. It has to go through the pharmacy therapeutics committee and you may need the chief resident to sign off and the nursing committee and all the way up to the chief medical officer.â As Chelius wrote in his testimony, âIf I were to comply with the Mifeprex *REMS*{: .small}, I would be doing more than just supporting access to abortion in my individual professional capacity. I would also have to involve, and win the approval of, multiple colleagues and staff members in the process of procuring, stocking, dispensing, and billing for Mifeprex.â For Dr. Chelius, who practices in a small, tight-knit community, there are also privacy concerns. Almost everyone knows someone who works at the hospital. He is also concerned for his and his familyâs safety. \n\nAs the A.C.L.U. lawsuit wends its way through the legal system, Republican members of Congress, the President, and a number of state legislatures continue to whittle away at the constitutional right to abortion established by Roe v. Wade. In late February, the Trump Administration said that it would [eliminate family-planning funding](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/health/trump-defunds-planned-parenthood.html) for organizations that refer patients to abortion services. A few days later, [legislation introduced by Senate Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/02/25/us/politics/ap-us-congress-abortion-the-latest.html) which would have placed criminal liabilities on doctors who failed to save the lives of babies born alive during abortions was narrowly defeated. (Opposition to so-called late-term abortion has become a public relations strategy of anti-abortion advocatesâmost recently, Donald Trump accused pro-choice Democrats of [encouraging infanticide](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18221707/trump-rally-el-paso-northam-abortion-virginia)âeven though third-trimester abortions are [extremely rare](https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/later-abortion) and live-birth abortions even rarer.) \n\nMeanwhile, a number of state legislatures are passing laws [to ban abortions in the event that Roe](https://rewire.news/article/2019/02/26/legislative-lowlights-abortion-restrictions-sweep-through-gop-held-legislatures/) is overturned by the Supreme Court, while simultaneously making them increasingly difficult to obtain: more than four hundred [new abortion restrictions](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2015/09/prosecuting-women-self-inducing-abortion-counterproductive-and-lacking-compassion) have been passed since  2011\\. An Iowa law, which was struck down at the beginning of the year, sought to ban abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat could be heard, sometimes as early as six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. Arkansas passed a comparable law, in 2013, that was also struck down, but other statesâFlorida, Kentucky, and Missouri among themâare [considering similar bans](https://rewire.news/article/2019/02/26/legislative-lowlights-abortion-restrictions-sweep-through-gop-held-legislatures/). There are [now six states](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/11/08/how-republicans-became-anti-choice/)âMississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kentucky, and West Virginiaâwith only a single abortion provider. In states like Texas, where the number of abortion clinics has been halved, some women have to travel up to three hundred miles to a clinic and then are forced, by law, to wait twenty-four hours after their first appointment before receiving an abortion.\n\nMedical abortion should make access easier, but some of the more recent state restrictions also make getting abortifacient drugs, which are already constrained by the *REMS*{: .small}, more difficult. [Seventeen states](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2018/10/self-managed-medication-abortion-expanding-available-options-us-abortion-care) require that a clinician be physically present when the mifepristone is taken. [Thirty-four states](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion) require those clinicians to be licensed physicians. Women who obtain and self-administer abortifacients outside the traditional medical establishment, typically from an Internet pharmacy, may be subject to arrest and imprisonment. In 2013, a woman in Pennsylvania who had ordered them online for her teen-age daughter [was sentenced](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gunalp9ZiMUJ:https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/gpr1807015.pdf+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=opera) to a nine-to-eighteen-month jail term for âproviding abortion without a medical license, dispensing drugs without being a pharmacist, assault and endangering the welfare of a child.â It is now possible to order these medications through [Aid Access](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/10/women-on-web-safe-abortion-mail/573322/), a program overseen by a doctor in the Netherlands. So far, no one has been arrested, but the promulgation of fetal-homicide lawsâthirty-eight states now have themâand aggressive prosecutors puts women at risk of arrest if they obtain them this way. According to the [Guttmacher Institute](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gunalp9ZiMUJ:https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/gpr1807015.pdf+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=opera), âthese laws are even being used to pursue women who are merely suspected of having self-induced an abortion but in fact had suffered miscarriages.â\n\nAs a resident of Hawaii, and as a participant in the Gynuity trial, Thomas was shielded from these dangers. After she was finally cleared to talk with Dr. Kaneshiro, Thomas sat outside, under a tree, during her lunch break, pulled out her smartphone, and spent about half an hour talking with the doctor. Soon afterward, the medications (and instructions) arrived in the mail. She would talk to Kaneshiro one more time, about a week after the abortion. \n\nThomas took the pills after she got home from work, the first one at 4:30 *P.M.*{: .small}, the second set at six, and, by eight, she was cramping. âI was just kind of watching TV and riding out the contractions,â which lasted for about six hours, she said. âI was exhausted, so, when it happened, it caught me so off-guard. The fetus was really small, but it was significant to me, so I cried. I just sat there, crying.â The abortion itself, she said, âwas a really natural process.â After a day of rest, Thomas was back at work; she is now a year away from finishing college. âI knew it was going to be hard, emotionally, because I have huge maternal instincts and I love children,â she said. âBut as hard as it was, and as sad as I was, and as much as I cried, I know that it wasnât in any way a bad decision, because I would never want to take care of a child except in the best possible way.â \n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ed841c92e2c9b85dc20","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ed841c92e2c9b85dc20","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Abortion

Her doctor told her that he was âincompatible with life.â Christensen and her husband wanted a child desperatelyâthey called him Spartacus, because of how hard he seemed to be fightingâbut she decided, immediately, to terminate the pregnancy: if the child was born, he would suffer, and would not live long; she wanted to minimize his suffering to whatever extent she could.\n\nChristensen lived in New York, a state where, since 2014, an estimated [twenty-five to twenty-seven per cent of pregnancies end in abortion](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/2014/#abor). Abortion was legalized in New York in 1970, three years before the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. Abortion was a crime in most other states; in New York, it became a crime with major exceptions. It is still regulated in the criminal code, and, Christensen learned, it is a crime in New York if an abortion is performed after a woman is twenty-four weeks pregnant, unless the motherâs life is in immediate jeopardy. Even though the baby in her womb would not be able to live outside of it, she would have to go elsewhere to have an abortion.\n\nPoliticians had been attempting for nearly a decade to pass a law called the Reproductive Health Act, which would remove abortion from New Yorkâs criminal code and codify the protections of Roe v. Wade, which affirms a womanâs right to an abortion, with limits, in state law. The R.H.A. had been approved multiple times by the Democrat-controlled state assembly, but it had never passed the state senate, which was controlled by Republicans.\n\nChristensen and her medical team made arrangements for her to travel to Colorado, where abortion is essentially regulated [like any other medical procedure](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-colorado). With help from her mother, she scrounged up more than ten thousand dollars to pay for the procedure and the trip. In Boulder, a doctor named Warren Hern administered an injection that stopped her babyâs heart but prevented her from bleeding and going into labor. Afterward, while waiting for her flight, she could not help feeling as if what sheâd done was shameful and illegal. She flew back to New York and had a physically excruciating stillbirth at a hospital.\n\nA week and a half later, she e-mailed me. I was working at the Web site Jezebel, which often publishes stories about abortion law. Christensen wanted to describe what had happened to her. When we spoke on the phone, her milk was still coming in. Her baseline experience of pregnancy had been punishing to begin with, and New York law had made it much worse.\n\n-=-=-=-\n \nWhen New York first legalized abortion, in 1970, it was one of only four states where the practice was legal. Of the four, New Yorkâs law was the most liberal, as it had no residency requirement. Between July of 1970 and January of 1973, roughly three hundred and fifty thousand out-of-state abortion patients came to New York; in the first two years after the state law passed, sixty per cent of women who had abortions in New York came from out of state. âNew York used to be an oasis,â Katie Watson told me recently. Watson is a professor and bioethicist at Northwestern, a former lawyer for the A.C.L.U. of Illinois, and the author of â[Scarlet A: The Ethics, Law, and Politics of Ordinary Abortion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/books/review-scarlet-a-abortion-katie-watson.html).â âIt changed things nationally,â she said, of New York State. âAnd then it just never updated its statute.â\n\nThe vast majority of abortions take place in the first trimester. Fewer than ten per cent of abortions occur at fourteen weeks or later, and, according to the Guttmacher Institute, only [slightly more than one per cent of abortions](https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/later-abortion) are performed at twenty-one weeks or later. Given how rare late-term abortion is, few elected officials are willing to risk the political costs of making it a cause. Late-term abortion makes many people deeply uncomfortable: at that point in a pregnancy, we are no longer talking about a lime-size fetus that hardly resembles a person.\n\nDoctors who perform late-term abortions have wrestled with the profound difficulties of fetal personhood; they have arguably done so to a greater extent than anyone else. Several years ago, I interviewed Dr. Susan Robinson, a now-retired late-term-abortion provider in New Mexico who appeared in the documentary â[After Tiller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf3rETOO62s),â about the only four doctors in the U.S. who, at the time the film was made, openly performed late-term abortions. (Dr. George Tiller, who previously had been part of that group, was murdered by an anti-abortion activist, in 2009\\.) Robinson told me that, in her practice, she used whatever terms her patients used. â[If she refers to it as her baby, Iâll refer to it as her baby](https://www.thehairpin.com/2013/09/interview-with-dr/),â she said. âIf sheâs named the baby, Iâll use the babyâs name, too.â She would ask patients, particularly those who were there because of fetal anomalies, if they wanted to hold their baby, and if they wanted footprints. She would cry with them and pray with them. âI mean, imagine being six months pregnant and finding out your babyâs missing half its brain, and youâve got this nursery youâve painted at home, youâre so readyâI donât want them to go home from the procedure with absolutely nothing to remember and honor the baby and its birth,â Robinson said.\n\nI was in my mid-twenties when I saw âAfter Tiller,â and it was the first time Iâd really thought about late-term abortion. I was struck by Robinsonâs aura of sorrowful compassion. She spent every day with an ethical question that many people abhor. I asked her how she drew her own linesâif she ever refused to perform an abortion when a womanâs fetus was healthy. The calculus was hard, she said. Sometimes the compelling factor was that the patient was eleven years old. But what if the patient were fifteen, or sixteen? âWhat is the ethical difference between doing an abortion at twenty-nine and thirty-two weeks?â she said she would ask herself, weighing each situation. Sheâd had a patient from France, she told me, who came to her at thirty-five weeks, and she had turned that woman down. âIt wouldnât be safe,â she said.\n\nSince that interview, Iâve come to think that understanding late-term abortion is a key to understanding abortion and reproduction generally. For people who believe that abortion is a medical procedure that a woman chooses to have, or not to have, in consultation with her doctor, why would we restrict abortion in our legal codes at all? The decision to restrict abortion in the legal code is based on the idea that there are people who want to kill babies, and the law exists to prevent killing. The conviction that we should instead regulate abortion medically is rooted in the proposition that late-term abortions happen not because women and doctors want to kill babies but because circumstances conspire to make late-term abortions necessary, and that the women who are in these situations, and their doctors, are the people best suited to decide when those circumstances have arrived.\n\nKatrina Kimport, a research sociologist and associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of CaliforniaâSan Francisco, has, over the past couple of years, been conducting [the most comprehensive research on late-term abortion to date](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2013/11/who-seeks-abortions-or-after-20-weeks). People have certain assumptions about late-term abortion, she told me. They imagine a woman spontaneously getting cold feet in her third trimester, or an indecisive dawdler who decides, on a whim, at twenty-seven weeks, that sheâs simply done. âBut, in reality,â Kimport told me, âthese are people who were planning to continue the pregnancy and obtained a piece of vital information that made that change. Or theyâre people who just did not know that they were pregnantâpeople with other existing physical conditions, or people without typical symptomsâwho then knew they didnât want to continue it, and then a series of obstacles pushed them over the line.â\n\nFor Kimport and other advocates for abortion access, a womanâs ability to decide if and when she becomes a mother is dependent not just on abortion rights but on a continuum of reproductive health access. Restrictions on contraceptionâhigh co-pays, insurance hoops, a lack of local clinics that provide birth controlâproduce more unwanted pregnancies, and thus increase [the number of abortions](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/10/contraceptive-use-key-reducing-abortion-worldwide). Restrictions on abortion providers, including mandatory waiting periods, so-called â[*TRAP*{:.small} laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/01/science/abortion-supreme-court-trump.html),â and fetal-pain laws, are intended to cause women to give up on getting abortions, but, in many cases, they simply insure that [abortions will be performed later](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/delays-in-accessing-care-among-us-abortion-patients) than women want them to be performed.\n\nIn the study that Kimport conducted with Diana Greene Foster, her colleague at U.C.S.F., women who sought late-term abortions were twelve weeks pregnant, on average, [when they discovered the pregnancy](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2013/11/who-seeks-abortions-or-after-20-weeks); women who sought first-trimester abortions were five weeks along, on average. Odile Schalit, the director at the Brigid Alliance, a new nonprofit that helps women travel to and from New York in order to obtain abortions, told me that the majority of the women the Brigid Alliance had served so far were New Yorkers who needed to leave the state for late-term abortions. âWe expect people to know immediately when theyâre pregnant, and to know exactly how to handle it,â Schalit said. âWe donât take into account the possibility of ambivalence, that theyâre minors, or that they have to figure out how to take off work and get childcare, or that they might be in a coercive, unsupportive, or abusive relationship, or that they might not have the financial or logistical or bodily autonomy to access real choice at all.â\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAfter speaking with Christensen in 2016, I transcribed and edited our conversation and posted it on Jezebel. To my surprise, and to Christensenâs, [more than a million people read the piece within the week](https://jezebel.com/interview-with-a-woman-who-recently-had-an-abortion-at-1781972395). Dozens of women wrote to me, telling me about their own late-term abortions; I forwarded their e-mails to Christensen, who had used a pseudonym for the interview. A social worker at Mount Sinai, the hospital where sheâd delivered, also passed along e-mails for her from women whoâd needed to terminate a pregnancy in the third trimester.\n\nRecently, I asked Christensen about her decision to speak with me, and about everything thatâs happened to her since. âI called the clinic before I talked to you,â she said, âand I asked if there was anything theyâd like me not to say. And then Dr. Hern grabbed the phone, and he told me, with all this urgency, âErika, you donât need to ask permission from anyone. Itâs your story.â&nbsp;â In the subsequent correspondence with the women who e-mailed herâshe called them her âsad pen palsââshe repeated his counsel: they didnât need to rationalize their decisions to her or to anyone. She started to consider becoming a pro-choice activist, under her real name. âAny fear I had about being attacked, being called a murderer, was trumped by not wanting people to think I was ashamed.â\n\nA few months after the piece was published, Katharine Bodde, a senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union, asked me if she could contact the woman in the interview. She got in touch with Christensen and told her about the Reproductive Health Act. In January, 2017, Christensen did her first public event in support of the R.H.A. A few weeks later, she and her husband, Garin Marschall, went to Albany to talk to legislators. She had recently  found out that she was pregnant again. âThey put a face on the issue,â Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the N.Y.C.L.U., told me. âIt changes the game when lawmakers are speaking to people who have been impacted by the law.â\n\nChristensen and Marschall had moved to Baltimore, but they trekked to Albany eight times during New Yorkâs 2017â18 legislative session to lobby for the bill, sometimes telling their story a dozen times in a day. In April, 2017, Christensen gave birth to a cherubic baby girl named Pepper. One month later, Marschall built the Web site [RHAVote.com](https://www.rhavote.com/). In early 2018, the family went on a tour of upstate cities to talk to people at events for congressional and state senate candidates. In the midterms, the Democrats picked up eight state senate seats, unseated five incumbents, and won a 40â23 majority in the chamber. Most of the newly elected Democrats had done an event in support of the R.H.A.\n\nSoon after the midterms, Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a statement about the legislative priorities for his third term. With [the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/brett-kavanaugh-donald-trump-and-the-things-men-do-for-other-men) to the Supreme Court, the âfederal assault on womenâs reproductive rightsâ had extended to a âSupreme Court that threatens to roll back Roe v. Wade,â the statement read. Cuomo insisted that both the R.H.A. and the [Comprehensive Contraception Coverage Act](https://www.nysenate.gov/issues/comprehensive-contraception-care-act) should be passed during the first thirty days of the new term.\n\nThe R.H.A. was originally written to garner bipartisan support, so that it could pass a conservative-controlled senate. It legalized late-term abortions, like Christensenâs, that involve the viability of a fetus. But, with a strong Democratic majority, there was a new question to consider. Did the political will exist to go further than Roe, and to affirm a womanâs right to an abortion with no legal restrictions? \n\nâIâm not sure that peopleâand specifically I mean pro-choice people who believe in limits, which is a lot of peopleâunderstand the full complexity of the issue,â Christensen told me. The facts of her own case, she said, lent themselves to sympathy, even among religious conservatives: she was a middle-class white woman who wanted to be a mother. But she didnât see her abortion as a tragedy. She felt lucky that she was able to get it. âAnd the same goes for cases that the R.H.A. doesnât cover, cases that donât seem as sympatheticâthe woman from a rural area who didnât find out she was pregnant until seventeen weeks, who has three kids already and no travel support. Do we leave those women out? And, if we do leave them out, do we at least understand what weâre doing?â Christensen said that, because of her year of intense hormonal fluctuations, she hadnât known that she was pregnant with Pepper until she was sixteen weeks along.\n\nâThe R.H.A. is a huge, enormously significant, long-awaited correction,â she said. âIf it passes exactly as is, it would be a huge step in the right direction. But, in a room full of people who trust women, I donât know why we would only trust them in specific circumstances. And Iâm afraid that, if the R.H.A. passes, no one will be ready to talk about abortion in New York again until weâre dead. But weâre certainly going to try.â\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nA law that governs abortion by examining a womanâs reasons for having one carries an implicit suggestion that there are objectively correct choices in pregnancy, choices that can be ascertained and judged by the body politic. But a woman who receives dire news about her fetus might do any number of things. She might choose to enter perinatal hospice, for instance, a model of care for parents who continue pregnancies when the babyâs life is expected to be brief. A woman whose pregnancy puts her in serious and immediate dangerâfrom her own body, from her partnerâmight choose to continue her pregnancy and risk her own life. âWhat if your doctor says that the baby will live ten days?â Kimport told me. âWhat if thereâs a five-per-cent chance that it will live to five years? How do you make sense of that? How do you codify this decision-making in a law that is supposed to apply to everyone?â\n\nâIt becomes very complicated when you say that the law decides whether a reason for abortion is valid or invalid,â Kimport went on. âBut when you let patients decide about abortion itâs much, much simpler in the end.â\n\nSoon after the midterms in November, R.H.A. advocatesârepresentatives from the National Institute for Reproductive Health, the N.Y.C.L.U., and other organizationsâmet with the billâs sponsors, the state assemblywoman Deborah Glick and the state senator Liz Krueger. The R.H.A. was nearly certain to pass, and yet the situation was delicate. The Democratic majority had made new possibilities visible: Oregon, for example, affirms [abortion as a constitutional right](https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/state-law/oregon/) and has no legislative restrictions on the procedure whatsoever. But to introduce either of those options might threaten the Democratic majority that made them possible in the first place. The R.H.A. still has [vocal opponents](https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2019/01/dont-expand-abortion-in-new-york-commentary.html). The Catholic Bishops of New York State [recently denounced it](https://www.whec.com/news/catholic-bishops-denounce-reproductive-health-act/5213978/); anti-abortion advocates have argued that the R.H.A. removes the stateâs ability to hold [domestic abusers of pregnant women](https://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/Viewpoint-RHA-mdash-dangerous-dehumanizing-13536945.php) fully accountable, and that the maternal-health exception effectively permits late-term abortion âon demandâ already. Republican opposition to the bill [had been subdued over the past year](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Senate-Republicans-struggle-to-define-opposition-13063686.php) but was almost certain to flare to life if it were significantly changed.\n\nIn the end, [the billâs language was expanded](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/s2796)âa memo at the top of the bill recognizes âa womanâs fundamental right to access safe, legal abortionââbut its substance remained largely the same. On January 17th, Glick and Krueger [reintroduced the bill](https://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2019/01/glick-krueger-reintroduce-rha/). âAfter years of fighting for the passage of this essential protection for women, our moment has finally arrived,â Glick said. Senate Democrats voiced their intention of passing it by January 22nd, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. At a recent event at Barnard College, Cuomo, standing onstage with Hillary Clinton, [reaffirmed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/nyregion/abortion-roe-wade-new-york.html) his commitment to the R.H.A, and pledged that he would not pass a budget until the R.H.A. and C.C.A. were both passed.âThe Republican Senate said, âYou donât need a state law codifying Roe v. Wade,â&nbsp;â he said. â&nbsp;âNo administration would ever roll back Roe v. Wade.â&nbsp;â Cuomo called on the legislature to pass a constitutional amendmentâwhich must pass in two separate legislative sessions and then be approved by votersâto affirm reproductive rights in the state constitution. This will likely be the next big push for advocates of the R.H.A.\n\nâWe have to understand abortion as an equal-rights issue,â Watson, the Northwestern professor, told me. âOnly women can have the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy after sex.â She was interested, she said, in âmoving from the politics of sympathy to the politics of respect. The politics of sympathy holds that a woman gets to have an abortion because itâs justified. The politics of respect would say that the pregnant woman determines the moral status of her fetus or embryo, and weighs that assessment against her own reasoning.â Really, she added, her preference was to take the law out of the picture. âWhy is later abortion not just a matter of what doctors would or wouldnât do?â\n\nWhile I was writing this piece, Christensen sent me an e-mail. She included a video of Pepper, who is nineteen months old now, in rainbow socks, playing with her motherâs dogs. âAs other states grow more and more restrictive, weâre going to have more and more people coming to New York,â she wrote. âDo we want them to scramble over the state line and feel like theyâre begging for help? Or do we want them to see that thereâs no shame here, that theyâre supported in their decisions?â After her abortion, she said, and in everything that followed, she had realized that she was good at talking to people about difficult things. âAnd we need to have those harder conversations,â she added. âWe need to ask people to work through and maybe live with their discomfort with this issue. We need people to understand that they may have to exchange some of their comfort in order to afford women real dignity, real trust.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cb02bc86f2c9a2449ef","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Abortion","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"abortion"},{"id":"5c2e1ed841c92e2c9b85dc20","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Abortion Rights","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"abortion-rights"},{"id":"5c2e1dcf2bfcc72cd92d0683","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"New York State","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"new-york-state"},{"id":"5c2e1c7781ab3335f580f161","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Womenâs Rights","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"womens-rights"},{"id":"5c2e1fd522d4972cd5b83542","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Womenâs Health","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"womens-health"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590b497fdd6207318b5dadaa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jia Tolentino is a staff writer at *The New Yorker* whose recent work includes an [exploration of youth vaping](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/the-promise-of-vaping-and-the-rise-of-juul) and essays on the ongoing cultural reckoning about sexual assault.

At the time, Kramerâs company, Six4Three, was embroiled in a lawsuit with Facebook, and the documents that he just happened to have access to while on a business trip to Englandâand which Collins just happened to know aboutâwere obtained during the discovery process. Although the documents were under seal in the United States, Collins claimed that they were fair game in the U.K., and threatened to arrest Kramer if he didnât turn them over. Their contents are incorporated into  Mondayâs report, which gets at its nominal subjectâthe dissemination of propaganda and intentionally divisive content on social mediaâby unmasking the ways that Facebook, in particular, has facilitated it.\n\nSix4Three sued Facebook for breach of contract, in 2015, after the social network cut off the companyâs  access to the profiles of Facebook usersâ friends. Six4Threeâs Pikinis app, which prospected for photographs of women in bikinis from pictures shared on Facebook, stopped working after the data stream dried up. At the time, Facebook claimed that its new policy was intended to protect usersâ privacy. It might have done so, too, if the company had adhered to it. But, as Kramer and his lawyers found out during the discovery process, Facebook continued to allow certain âwhite-listedâ companiesâNetflix, Airbnb, and Lyft, among themâto harvest friendsâ data. Facebook considered giving companies this access as long as they spent at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year advertising on the platform or if they had something of value they could trade in exchange. The report cites an e-mail from March, 2015, in which Facebook executives discuss giving Tinder white-listed status in return for the use of the term âMoments,â which Facebook subsequently named its new photo-sharing app, three months later. âThe idea of linking access to friendsâ data to the financial value of the developersâ relationship with Facebook was a recurring feature of the documents,â the report explains.\n\nThe report also reveals that Facebook executives conspired to bait Android phone users into agreeing to hand over their text messages and call logs during a software upgrade, even though it was âa pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective,â Michael LeBeau, a Facebook product manager, wrote in an e-mail. Facebookâs public-relations strategy, according to the reportâs authors, was âto make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features of the upgrade of their app.â\n\nAdditionally, a V.P.N. app that Facebook bought from Israeli developers, which ostensibly intended to keep usersâ browsing activities from being tracked, was actually sharing their Web wanderings with Facebook, so that the company could âgain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.â Those insights included identifying the apps and services that were most popular among Facebook users, which gave the company a predatory advantage: its executives could either acquire those apps, as they did with WhatsApp and Instagram, or they could simply shut them down, as they did with the [video-advertising system LiveRail](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/m-and-nay/). This leads Collins and his colleagues to wonder if Facebook might be exposed to a racketeering lawsuit in the United States. Historically, the *RICO*{: .small} Act has been used to go after mobsters, not tech platforms or their executives. But, early in the report, the authors call Facebookâs chairman and C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, and his team âdigital gangsters,â so thereâs a certain logic to it.\n\nThe chicanery of Facebook executives, combined with their allegiance to profit over people and their continued insistence that Facebook is merely a neutral platform, created the conditions through which so much propaganda has been disseminated online. Cambridge Analytica, which purchased the data of eighty-seven million Facebook profiles from a third-party app developer to use on behalf of the Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Presidential campaigns, was enabled by Facebookâthe company not only supplied the raw material for Cambridge Analyticaâs algorithms but was also the medium for its targeted messaging. Some of that messaging was intended to discourage certain Americans from voting and to inject discord into the electorate. Facebook, too, along with Twitter and Instagram, was an ideal vector for similar work undertaken by the Russian Internet Research Agency. In September, 2017, Facebookâs then chief security officer, Alex Stamos, told Facebook executives that malign Russian-state actors were still active on the siteâinformation that those executives chose to ignore, according to an investigation by the New York *Times*. A few months later, other members of Facebookâs management appeared to have, as the report puts it, âmisledâ the Collins committee when they testified that outside agents were not using the platform to influence elections. \n\nFacebook was also used to surreptitiously influence the Brexit vote in the U.K. In arcane detail, the commission explains why it believes an obscure Canadian company called Aggregate I.Q. (A.I.Q.) harvested Facebook usersâ profiles and linked them to voter files in order to âprecisely targetâ them with pro-Leave messages. According to the report, âThe work of [A.I.Q.] highlights the fact that data has been and is still being used extensively by private companies to target people, often in a political context, in order to influence their decisions. It is far more common that people think.â Indeed, in a ten-month period during 2018, an anonymous, âhighly misleading,â pro-Brexit Web site called Mainstream Network spent an estimated two hundred and fifty-seven thousand pounds on Facebook ads that reached nearly eleven million users. âMainstream Network is yet another, more recent example of an online organisation [sic] seeking to influence political debate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there is no good case for [it] to hide behind anonymity,â the report says. Zuckerbergâs proxy in London, Richard Allan, has not responded to the committeeâs requests to reveal who is behind Mainstream Networkâwhich is to say, who is paying for its Facebook adsâbut he has promised to do so. âWe consider Facebookâs response generally to be disingenuous and another example of Facebookâs bad faith,â the reportâs authors wrote.\n\nIn response to the report, Karim Palant, Facebookâs public-policy manager in the U.K., released a statement, which said, âWe are open to meaningful regulation and support the committeeâs recommendation for electoral law reform.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do. We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.â Palant added, âWhile we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago.â\n\nIf a *RICO*{: .small} prosecution seems unlikely, how will governments hold Facebook to account? Facebook is global and the Internet is borderless, but laws are not. Strict new data-protection laws in California, for example, which, among other things, empower residents to ask for their data to be erased and object to its sale, stop at the state line. The General Data Protection Regulation issued by the European Union, which went into effect last year, only covers E.U. residents. And as comprehensive as it is, the G.D.P.R. doesnât cover âinferred dataââthe assumptions made about individuals by computer models that are then passed on to advertisers. One popular example of this is Facebookâs âlookalike audiencesâ tool, which categorizes people on the basis of their similarity to others with analogous interests and traits. The Los Angeles *Times* [reported](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-facebook-nazi-metal-ads-20190221-story.html) on Thursday that Facebook continues to allow advertisers to search for and target âhundreds of thousands of usersâ who âthe social media firm believes are curious about topics such as âJoseph Goebbels,â âJosef Mengele,â âHeinrich Himmler,â the neo-nazi punk band Skrewdriver and Benito Mussoliniâs long-defunct National Fascist Party.â \n\nThe Collins committee has offered numerous proposals and suggestions for reform, starting with a âcompulsory Code of Ethicsâ for all tech companies, enforced by an independent regulatory authority, which would establish acceptable practices online. âThis should include harmful and illegal content that has been referred to the companies for removal by their users, or that should have been easy for tech companies themselves to identify,â the report states. But defining what constitutes harmful or illegal content, as weâve seen repeatedly, can be tricky: one personâs art, for example, is anotherâs pornography; one groupâs war reporting is anotherâs recruiting tool. Content moderation has bedeviled social-media companies from the start, and it only gets more challenging as propagandists become more adept at manipulation. And ethics, codified or not, will always bump up against culture.\n\nWhile the big tech companies have stated publicly that they are open to regulation, in the United States they have deployed armies of lobbyists to block government oversightâor at least to neuter it. So far the lobbyists have prevailed, but their power may be waning. Last November, Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, proposed new privacy legislation that would impose substantial fines on companies that fail to comply with the requirements set forth in the bill, one of which is filing annual reports with the Federal Trade Commission certifying compliance. Perhaps more substantial, the bill calls for up to a [twenty-year prison sentence](https://www.insideprivacy.com/data-privacy/wyden-releases-draft-privacy-bill-increasing-ftc-authority-providing-for-civil-fines-and-criminal-penalties/) for anyone who submits a false report. Wydenâs bill is intended to give more bite to what has been, until now, toothless governance by the F.T.C. Meanwhile, the F.T.C., at last, appears to be embracing its statutory authority over tech companies. According to the Washington *Post*, the commission is in negotiations with Facebook over a fine that is [reported to be in the billions of dollars](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/14/us-government-facebook-are-negotiating-record-multi-billion-dollar-fine-companys-privacy-lapses/), that has been issued for the companyâs failure to comply with an F.T.C. consent decree prohibiting Facebook from sharing usersâ data without their permission. \n\nWhen Facebook signed the consent decree, in 2011, it was essentially [agreeing with the F.T.C.](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/11/facebook-settles-ftc-charges-it-deceived-consumers-failing-keep) that it had âdeceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.â But neither that charge, nor Facebookâs agreement that it would thereafter comply with F.T.C. regulations, was enough to keep the company from continuing to allow third-party developers to siphon data without  usersâ consent. Indeed, as Allan told the Collins committee when he testified in Parliament, in November, Facebookâs senior leadership, including Zuckerberg, knew that the company was continuing to allow third-party access to usersâ data even when those users had not given permission. This time, Marc Rotenberg, of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told the Washington *Post*, a steep fine would âindicate the FTC is now prepared to enforce its consent orders.â \n\nThe F.T.C. began its most recent investigation of Facebook last March, after the Cambridge Analytica revelations. The Collins committee asserts that had Facebook complied with the 2011 consent decree, the Cambridge Analytica data breach would not have happened. This may be true, but as the report also makes clear, Facebook appeared to have no plans to comply with the F.T.C. order. Just months after the consent decree went into effect, in November, 2012, Zuckerberg sent a lengthy e-mail to senior executives that, as the committee suggests, appeared to prioritize âdeveloper access to data from users who had not granted data permission to the developer.â Also in that e-mail, Zuckerberg tells his team that he favors âreciprocityâ with developers. This, the report states, âenabled Facebook to gain as much information as possible, by requiring apps that used data from Facebook to allow their users to share their data back to Facebook (with scant regard to usersâ privacy).â\n\nCalling out Facebook for its bad faith and disingenuousness only goes so far. Last October, after the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee issued its interim report, the British government accepted [only three of its forty-two recommendations](https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/mps-criticise-government-over-disappointing-response-to-fake-news-inquiry-interim-report/). It remains to be seen what it will do this time, after an eighteen-month inquiry entailing 4,350 questions, a hundred and seventy written submissions, and seventy-three witnesses has unearthed incontrovertible evidence that propagandists intent on undermining social cohesion were largely enabled by the arrogance, irresponsibility, and rapaciousness of the executives of a single company. This is a final report, the authors write in an introduction, but they promise it will not be their final word.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Facebook","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e235836cecf40192145b8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e235836cecf40192145b8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"British

Who, that is, besides Facebook executives and their lawyers? Until a little over a week ago, the company had successfully sequestered internal e-mails, which were obtained by the legal team of Ted Kramer, the founder of the app company Six4Three, during the discovery process in a 2015 lawsuit. At issue was Facebookâs policy of allowing third-party app developers to access the data of Facebook usersâ friendsâthe very policy that enabled [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cambridge-analytica) to buy the data of eighty-seven million unwitting users on behalf of the Trump campaign. In Kramerâs case, his Pikinis app relied on that access; once Facebook changed its policy, in 2014, the app no longer worked. Kramer cried foul and sued Facebook for breach of contract. At the companyâs request, the judge in the case ordered the records sealed to keep them, ironically, private.\n\nThat changed on November 20th, when a parliamentary sergeant-at-arms showed up at Kramerâs London hotel room and escorted him to the halls of Westminster, where the Tory M.P. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, demanded that Kramer turn over all his files in the case under threat of arrest. Kramer, who was in London on unrelated business, said that he panicked and moved a number of files from a Dropbox account to a USB drive, which he turned over to the M.P. How Collins knew that Kramer was in London has been traced to the tireless *Guardian* reporter Carole Cadwalladr, who has spent more than two years unravelling the connections between Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), [Steve Bannon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon), Robert Mercer, and [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit). After arranging to meet with Kramer, she appears to have [tipped](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/six4three-kramer-collins-facebook) off Collins to Kramerâs whereabouts. But how Collins knew that Kramer was in possession of the documentsâwhich were not his to haveâremains a mystery. There are reports that the two men had been in communication for the past few months, at Cadwalladrâs prompting, which suggests that the frog march to Parliament was just for show. (When Kramerâs lawyers found out that he was in possession of the discovery documents and that he had given them to Collins, they attempted to drop him, but, over the weekend, a California judge [demanded](http://fortune.com/2018/12/01/facebook-leak-six4three/) that they continue to represent Kramer until the matter of the purloined files is adjudicated.) \n\nCollins, for his part, claimed that whatever seal was in force in California was irrelevant in the U.K. On November 27th, he used the snatched e-mails to grill Richard Allan, the Facebook executive who was sent to speak for the company at an unprecedented international hearing on fake news and disinformation that Collins convened in Parliament. [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg), who said he was too busy to appearâmaking this the fourth time that he has refused a request from Parliamentâwas represented by a nameplate positioned in front of an empty chair; every time the television cameras panned to Allan, they also showed his absent boss. Allan admitted that the optics were ânot great,â and then went on to do his best Zuckerberg imitation, dodging and feinting as the lawmakers sought to put him on the spot. The most damning [claim](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-considered-charging-for-access-to-user-data-1543454648) to emerge was that Facebook either gave, or considered giving, favored access to its usersâ data to companies that spent at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in advertising on the platform. There also seemed to be [evidence](https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/a3mkxe/facebook-was-aware-of-russian-meddling-as-far-back-as-2014) that Facebook had been informed, in 2014, that computers with Russian I.P. addresses were siphoning three billion data points a day from Facebook accounts, a claim that Allan refused to address in the hearing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Collins published the full cache that he seized from Kramer. The [two hundred and fifty pages](https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Note-by-Chair-and-selected-documents-ordered-from-Six4Three.pdf) of internal Facebook documents show, irrefutably, that the company did indeed whitelist a number of lucrative business partners, including Netflix, Lyft, and Airbnb, allowing them continued and unfettered access to the accounts of Facebook users and their friends after the company claimed that it had stopped the practice. The documents also reveal that, in 2015, a permissions update for Android devices, which users were required to accept, included a feature that continuously uploaded text messages and call logs to Facebook. \n\nThe fallout from Ted Kramerâs London misadventure was just one debacle of many during Facebookâs terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month. Back at Facebook headquarters, in Menlo Park, Zuckerberg was quite busy after all, doing damage control after a scathing New York *Times* exposÃ©. â[Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebookâs Leaders Fought Through Crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html),â which was published on November 14th, created one of the biggest crises in the companyâs history. As if to prove the reportersâ claims, Zuckerberg publicly denied their veracity. But the *Times* piece was deeply sourced and contained the disturbing revelation that the company had enlisted a right-wing opposition-research group, Definers Public Affairs, to dig up dirt on [George Soros](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-soros) after Soros gave a blistering [speech](https://www.businessinsider.com/george-soros-calls-facebook-google-menace-society-obstacles-innovation-2018-1) at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, decrying the power of social media, especially Facebook and [Google](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/google), for their âfar-reaching adverse consequences on the functioning of democracy, particularly on the integrity of elections.â\n\nDefiners Public Affairs had previously [pushed](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/everything-facebook-said-on-sheryl-sandberg-definers-since-nyt-report.html) out misinformation about the Apple C.E.O., Tim Cook, on behalf of the tech company Qualcomm, which wanted to undermine Cookâs relationship with the Trump Administration. For Facebook, Definers launched a P.R. campaignâpropagated through the conservative and alt-right media ecospheresâthat traded on anti-Semitic innuendo to suggest that Soros was the deep pockets behind a grassroots anti-Facebook group.  News of Facebookâs campaign against Soros came out three weeks after Cesar Sayoc, a fervent Trump supporter, sent a pipe bomb to Sorosâand also to the Clintons, the billionaire Tom Steyer, and other prominent Democrats. \n\nAnd then it got worse. On November 15th, shortly after the *Times* exposÃ© was published, Facebook [claimed](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/everything-facebook-said-on-sheryl-sandberg-definers-since-nyt-report.html), âThe New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebookâs behalf or to spread misinformation.â The next day, Facebookâs chief operating officer, [Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/sheryl-sandberg), who is in charge of the companyâs communications team, said, somewhat intricately, âI did not know about or hire Definers or any firm.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;Definers was hired, we have lots of firms. They were hired not to smear anyone.â But then, the night before Thanksgiving, in a Facebook blog post that the company perhaps thought would be lost in the holiday shuffle, Sandberg allowed that âI did receive a small number of e-mails where Definers was referenced.â A week later, after another damning [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/technology/definers-public-affairs-tim-miller.html) in the *Times*, a company spokesperson admitted that it was Sandberg herself who had initiated an investigation into whether Soros had a financial interest in criticizing Facebookâthat is, if the veteran financier had engaged in what is called âshort and distort,â trash-talking a company after betting that its stock will lose value. Not surprisingly, he hadnât.\n\nSorosâs complaints about Facebook were hardly original: former Facebook employees such as Chamath Palihapitiya, who served as its vice-president for growth, and investors including Roger McNamee have made similar criticisms. Nor was Soros being speculative. At the time of his Davos talk, the companyâs role in enabling Russian operatives to exploit social divisions in the United States through Facebook ads and user pages, and helping the Trump campaign suppress the African-American vote, were well known. Indeed, in a two-part âFrontlineâ documentary, â[The Facebook Dilemma](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/facebook-dilemma/),â which was released at the end of October, a collection of former Facebook employees expressed concerns about the unwillingness of Zuckerberg and Sandberg to take meaningful responsibility for Facebookâs immense power and capacity to do harm. âMy concerns, at the time, were that I knew that there were all these malicious actors who would do a wide range of bad things given the opportunity, given the ability to target people based on this information that Facebook had,â Sandy Parakilas, who had been the companyâs platform-operations manager in 2011, told the filmmakers. âSo I started thinking through what are the worst-case scenarios of what people could do with this data&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;and I shared that with a number of people, both people in privacy and some senior executives. And the response was muted, I would say.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;I got the sense that this just wasnât their priority. They werenât that concerned about the vulnerabilities that the company was creating.â\n\nThose vulnerabilities were on full display on November 5th, the day before the midterm elections. In an effort to prevent the kinds of malign interferences that had dogged the Presidential election two years earlier, Facebook had set up what it was calling a âwar roomâ to monitor its network. The company had already [removed](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/31/technology/facebook-removes-pages/index.html) thirty Facebook pages, which it believed were designed by Russians to interfere with the elections. The war room was both a public declaration that Facebook was taking fake news and propaganda seriously and an admission that the platform remained susceptible to manipulation. âThis is going to be a constant arms race,â Katie Harbath, Facebookâs global-politics and government-outreach director, [told](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17991924/facebook-election-war-room-misinformation-fake-news-whatsapp) the Verge. âThis is our new normal. Bad actors are going to get more sophisticated in what theyâre doing, and weâre going to have to get more sophisticated in trying to catch them.â Since elections happen around the world throughout the year, the company planned to keep the war room open âfor the foreseeable future.â\n\nThat same day, Business for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit organization, issued a report that Facebook had commissioned to address concerns about the platformâs role in the Rohingya genocide, in Myanmar. While the Facebook platform has been used in other countries to cultivate ethnic and sectarian violenceâNigeria, Germany, Egypt, India, and Sri Lanka among themâits co-optation by the Myanmar Army was especially heinous. Adopting the playbook of Russian operatives, the Army created hundreds of seemingly innocuous Facebook accounts about celebrities, entertainment, and beauty, which it used to plant incendiary narratives about the countryâs Muslim minority. In its response to the B.S.R. report, Alex Warofka, Facebookâs product-policy manager, said that the company had already implemented a number of its recommendations but that âthere is more to do.â \n\nShortly after the Myanmar report was issued, Facebook was compelled to take down an inflammatory, racist [video ad](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-runs-racist-ad-on-facebook-targeting-arizona-and-florida), paid for by the Trump campaign, on the grounds that the ad âviolates Facebookâs advertising policy against sensational content.â The spot, which targeted voters in Florida and Arizona, blamed Democrats for an undocumented immigrant who had twice been deported before killing two sheriffâs deputies, in Sacramento, in 2014\\. Facebookâs policy disallows ads that are âdehumanizing or denigrating [to an] entire group of people, and using frightening and exaggerated rumors of danger.â The company removed the ad only after it had already been seen on Facebook by as many as five million people. And hereâs the rub: while the ad âcannot receive paid distribution,â the company declared, âthe video is allowed to be posted on Facebook.â So there you have it, the fecklessness of Facebook in a single sentence.\n\nNovember has passed, but Facebookâs troubles have not. A departing African-American Facebook employee charged, in a Facebook [post](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/27/facebook-has-problem-black-people-former-employee-says/2126056002/), that the company was âfailing its black employees and its black usersâ; Facebook [took down](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/04/facebook-mark-s-luckie-african-american-workers-users) his post. *Wired* [reported](https://www.wired.com/story/nonprofits-facebook-get-hacked-need-help/) that the company was abandoning charitiesâwhich it had lured to the platformâonce theyâd been hacked. The election war room has been [dismantled](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/26/facebook-wont-use-its-war-room-for-future-elections-report-says.html), leading some to suggest that it was a publicity stunt. Definers Public Affairs is no longer working for Facebook, but the damage to Sheryl Sandbergâs credibility and carefully coiffed public persona may prove irreversibleâas Michelle Obama [said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/03/michelle-obama-lean-in-sheryl-sandberg) the other day, âitâs not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesnât work all the time.â And that creepy Pikinis app, courtesy of Damian Collins, has now supplied a portrait of naked greed and corporate dissembling.

Reporters from the *Guardian*, *The New Yorker*, *The New York Review of Books*, *Das Magazin*, and the Intercept have been reporting these facts *for years*. We knew [as early](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data?CMP=share_btn_tw) as December, 2015, for instance, that Facebook data obtained without usersâ knowledge was being exploited by Cambridge Analytica on behalf of Senator Ted Cruz, who at that time was Mercerâs preferred candidate in the Republican Presidential primaries. Later, when the Mercer family, along with Steve Bannon, came to support Donald Trump, it was no secret that they brought with them Cambridge Analytica, a firm that boasted of being able to parse and influence the electorate through âpsychographicâ algorithms derived from that data. After Trump won, Alexander Nix, the head of Cambridge Analytica, crowed that the companyâs psychographic algorithms had carried the day. (He later retracted that, then reaffirmed it.)\n\nThe millions of Facebook accounts in questionâas the reporter Mattathias Schwartz [pointed out](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/30/facebook-failed-to-protect-30-million-users-from-having-their-data-harvested-by-trump-campaign-affiliate/) last Marchâwere mostly culled from the friend networks of people who clicked on a cute personality quiz on the site. A significant number of the initial test takers, starting in around 2014, were paid freelancers recruited through Amazonâs Mechanical Turk marketplace by a British research company called GSR. They and others who took the quiz likely did not know that they were giving GSR permission to access their Facebook friendsâ profiles. If Facebook officials were not aware of this at the time, when GSR sold this data to Cambridge Analytica, they certainly knew it by January, 2017, when the Swiss researchers Hannes Grassegger and Mikael Krogerus published âThe Data That Turned the World Upside Down,â a detailed account of how C.A.âs psychological modelling was used by the Trump campaign. (The *Guardian* [recently quoted](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/20/facebook-data-cambridge-analytica-sandy-parakilas) a former Facebook employee in charge of data security explaining that he âalways assumed there was something of a black marketâ for data obtained by third-party companies such as GSR, and that when he brought this up to his bosses he was discouraged from investigating too deeply. âDo you really want to see what youâll find?â he says a Facebook executive told him.) \n\nWhen Facebook finally acknowledged that Cambridge Analytica was using Facebook data it had obtained surreptitiously, the companyâs response was not to alert its users or audit its partners or engage in any sort of meaningful reform. Rather, it sent a polite request to Cambridge Analytica asking it to delete the GSR-sourced material, some of which, [according](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html) to the *Times,* remains on the companyâs servers. \n\nThis weekendâs reports about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica did introduce us to Christopher Wylie, a twenty-eight-year-old Canadian coder and data scientist, who conceived and helped construct C.A.âs psychographic tools. For at least a year, it seems, Wylie had been feeding information to Carole Cadwalladr and her team at the *Guardian* and its sister paper, the *Observer*. Now he is out of the shadows. In a [thirteen-minute video](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-we-spent-1m-harvesting-millions-of-facebook-profiles-video) posted on the *Guardianâs* Web site on Saturday, Wylie details the story of the creation and deployment of âthe weaponâ that he and Nix sold to Bannon, and then to Mercer, to fight their âculture war.â It was in those early days of 2014, Wylie says, that he and Bannon began testing slogans like âdrain the swampâ and âthe deep stateâ and âbuild the wall,â and found a surprising number of Americans who responded [strongly](http://www.apple.com) to them. All they needed was a candidate to parrot them. Cambridge Analytica promised that psychographics could not only target people as voters but also as personalities. âWe would know what kind of messaging youâd be susceptible to and where you are going to consume it and how many times we are going to have to touch you with it to change how you think about something,â Wylie told the *Guardian*. âWeb sites will be created. Blogs will be createdâwhatever we think this target profile will be receptive to. See it, click it, and go down the rabbit hole until they start to think something different.â The goal was to break society. âIt is only when you break it can you remodel the pieces into your vision of a new society.â As one former executive of Mercerâs hedge fund told *The New Yorkerâs* [Jane Mayer](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency), last year, âHe wants it to *all* fall down.â\n\nPerhaps [the most telling revelation](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-latest-cambridge-analytica-expose-raises-more-questions-about-firms-role-in-the-trump-campaign) from the recent reportingâaside from the U.K.âs Channel 4 catching Alexander Nix on camera [explaining](https://www.channel4.com/news/cambridge-analytica-revealed-trumps-election-consultants-filmed-saying-they-use-bribes-and-sex-workers-to-entrap-politicians-investigation) how his company could supply beautiful Ukrainian women to entrap politiciansâis that Cambridge Analytica is essentially a shell company created by the British firm Strategic Communications Laboratories. During the 2016 campaign, according to Cadwalladr, C.A. was staffed primarily by non-U.S. citizens, in possible violation of American campaign-finance laws. This included the contractors the firm brought to Austin, Texas, to work with Trumpâs digital team there.\n\nâWe were really speaking directly to the voters in a number of states,â one former C.A. employee, who worked with a number of non-U.S. citizens or green-card holders, [told the *Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-non-american-employees-political). Cadwalladr writes, âIt is understood that some were working on tourist visas. Another ex-employee claimed that they had been provided with letters to give to US border control officials where needed, stating that they would not be workingâ in the United States. And, she points out, Bannon, Nix, and Rebekah Mercer (Robertâs daughter) knew that this was illegal. Their counsel, who happened to work at Rudolph Giulianiâs law firm, let them know in a memo written in July, 2014.\n\nThese Cambridge Analytica contractors worked with Trumpâs digital team, headed by Brad Parscale and Jared Kushner. Alongside all of them were Facebook employees who were embedded with the Trump campaign to help them use Facebookâs various tools most effectivelyâincluding the so-called âdark posts,â used to dissuade African-Americans from showing up to vote. Did any of them know that the data that Cambridge Analytica was using to target voters, craft ads and blog posts, and determine Trumpâs travel schedule came from millions of American Facebook members whose data had been taken without consent and sold for a million dollarsâwhat Cadwalladr is calling a massive data âbreachâ? Maybe, or maybe notâand it hardly matters. For more than a year, Cadwalladr has done yeoman work, reporting on the nihilism of Bannon and the Mercers, the cravenness of Nix, and connecting the dots between them and Trump and Facebook. But those millions of Facebook profiles do not in fact constitute a breach: they were obtained legally. Nobody hacked Facebookânor would they have had toâbecause the business model of Facebook is predicated on mining the personal details of its two billion users. In a [statement](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071) on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg could only chalk the whole saga up to âa breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.â The company is aided in maintaining this position by privacy policies that are as obscure as they are lax. As a consequence, Facebook created the conditions for millions of Americans to become unwitting cogs in the effort to get Trump elected.\n\nChristopher Wylie knew all this, and he watched what he now calls his âgrossly unethical experimentâ unfold in real time. It is, he says, âsomething that I regret.â So now heâs blown the whistle and, in turn, Facebook has suspended his account. The company may have shot the messenger, but, even so, his message has been heard loud and clear, in Parliament (where Nix, who has now been suspended by Cambridge Analytica, will be called back to explain what appear to be the lies he told there last month, during hearings on fake news), in Congress (where Nix and possibly Zuckerberg will also be called to account), on the front page of newspapers around the world, and on Twitter (where the hashtags âWhereâs Zuck?â and âDeleteFacebookâ have been trending). Wylieâs words have also reverberated on Wall Street, where, in the first two hours of trading after his video confession (and the news that he had supplied e-mails and documents to American and British authorities), Facebook stock lost thirty billion dollars in value. It is now down by sixty billion dollars. It would not be wrong to call this payback. \n\n*This article has been updated to correctly identify the Intercept reporter who wrote the March, 2017, article.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c80e56e652c90274670","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cambridge Analytica","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cambridge-analytica"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1e8236cecf40192143c3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Data Breach","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"data-breach"},{"id":"5c2e1dcfb75f002c8941e5db","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Robert Mercer","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"robert-mercer"},{"id":"5c2e1d564a08312cd3aa6d09","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Security","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"security"},{"id":"5c2e1c78ee7fe02cbd163327","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Privacy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"privacy"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5ac2e2e17730741c5fa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sue Halpern, a contributing writer covering politics and technology, has been writing for *The New Yorker* since 2005.

Or, to put the question another way, what is the cost of becoming known for doing things that donât match your words?\n\nTo put a number on that, Tony Simons, a management professor at Cornell, took an unusually detailed look inside the hotel industry. In 1999, Simons and a fellow-researcher, Judi McLean Parks, interviewed employees at seventy-six Holiday Inn hotels in the United States and Canada. They surveyed more than seven thousand staff members, in English, Spanish, Chinese, Creole French, and Vietnameseâincluding five hundred illiterate employees, with whom they did verbal surveys. They asked workers to score, on a scale of one to five, statements such as âMy manager practices what he preaches.â Those results allowed them to score each hotel on what Simons called âbehavioral integrity.â\n\nThen Simons and his team compared those results with the financial records of each Holiday Inn. âIt turned out that trust had a huge impact on performance,â Simons told me this week. Hotels with higher behavioral integrity scores were substantially more profitable than those with lower scores: an advantage of an eighth of a point correlated to a 2\\.5 per cent advantage in revenues. Simons, who chronicled the hotel study and others in his 2008 book, â[The Integrity Dividend](https://www.amazon.com/Integrity-Dividend-Leading-Power-Your/dp/047018566X),â told me, âThis is the single most powerful performance driver ever. Itâs more important than employee commitment and worker satisfaction.â\n\nI called Simons on Wednesday, as Facebook, a company whose fortune rests, more than most, on maintaining its usersâ trust, encountered its latest round of difficulties. That morning, the attorney general for the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against Facebook for allowing Cambridge Analytica, the British political-consulting company with ties to President Trump, to gain access to the personal data of tens of millions of users without their permission. It was the first major step by American regulators to punish the company for the Cambridge Analytica case, and other suits, fines, and punishments are likely to follow.\n\nFor Facebook, it had already been a long week. On Monday, the Senate Intelligence Committee released two reportsâone produced by New Knowledge, a private security company, and the other by Oxfordâs Computational Propaganda Projectâthat offered the most extensive look yet at Russiaâs efforts to divide Americans, suppress votes, and boost Donald Trump during the 2016 Presidential election. The [reports](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ira-propaganda-senate-report/) found that one of the most extensive campaigns was directed at discouraging African-Americans from voting for Hillary Clinton, by stoking distrust in her and in the political system. In a damaging detail, the New Knowledge report asserted that when Congress asked Facebook for information about that campaign, in October, the company âdissembledâ in its responses. (The company was asked, âDoes Facebook believe that any of the content created by the Russian Internet Research Agency was designed to discourage anyone from voting?â In its response, Facebook said, âWe believe this is an assessment that can be made only by investigators with access to classified intelligence and information from all relevant companies and industries.â)\n\nAfter that news broke, the N.A.A.C.P. called for a one-day boycott of Facebook. In a statement, Derrick Johnson, the president and chief executive officer of the N.A.A.C.P., said, âFacebook needs to acknowledge how it has undervalued people of color over the past two years.â\n\nIn Facebookâs telling, it grew so fast that it failed to protect its customers, but now that it is a behemoth, with a greater awareness of its responsibility, the company is doing all it can to mend those holes. Last spring, after Facebook was found to have allowed its usersâ private data to get into the hands of Cambridge Analytica, the Facebook chairman and C.E.O., [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg), visited Congress and vowed to restore control to ordinary users. âThis is the most important principle for Facebook,â he said. âEvery piece of content that you share on Facebook you own, and you have complete control over who sees it, and how you share it, and you can remove it at any time.â When [Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/sheryl-sandberg), the chief operating officer, testified before Congress, in September, she said the company was now doing all that it could to prevent foreign governments from interfering in American elections: âWe were too slow to spot this and too slow to act. Thatâs on us.â\n\nThe clarity of those declarations becomes a problem when Facebookâs actions tell another story. On Tuesday, an [investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html) by the *Times* revealed that Facebook gave other big tech companies âmore intrusive access to usersâ personal data than it has disclosed.â For example, Facebook gave Netflix and Spotify the power to read Facebook usersâ private messages. The goal was to let Facebook users share music and entertainment recommendations; there is no evidence that Spotify and Netflix were reading peopleâs mail. (Both companies said that they were unaware of the access levels that Facebook had granted them.)\n\nBut the case reflects a fundamental problem: Facebook was so determined to grow, and to cement the commercial partnerships that would help it grow, that it didnât pause to build tools that could parcel out narrow slices of information. In other instances, it opened the spigot on private information and forgot to close it. As a result, it once again betrayed its usersâ confidence. On Wednesday, a former Facebook staffer who is familiar with those cases told me, âIt was chaos. There was no set of principles that says this is how we do things and how we do not do things. They would forget to shut things down, literally for years.â\n\nIn a [response](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/facebooks-partners/) to the *Times* story, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, Facebookâs director of developer platforms and programs, conceded that âweâve needed tighter managementâ of data sharing but stood by the companyâs claim that ânone of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without peopleâs permission.â After two years of declining public confidence, thatâs an astonishingly obtuse thing to say. Users did have to check a box to integrate Facebook and Spotify. But does Facebook really believe that users understood that it would give Spotify the right to read private messages? On Twitter, Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote, âOpening someone elseâs mail is a federal crime. Why is @Facebook allowed to let Netflix and Spotify open your private messages? Mark Zuckerberg might think of this as just âdata,â but this is peopleâs private lives. We need a law to protect Americansâ sensitive information.â\n\nWhich brings us back to Holiday Inn and the cost of losing trust. How many violations does it take for people to think twice before they decide to do business with someone? Simons told me, âTrust is the willingness to accept vulnerability. In a personal relationship, it is the willingness to self-disclose and be honest. For Facebook, it is the very willingness of the informed to participate in their platform.â\n\nThe trust calculus can be subtle, but, over time, it shapes behavior. In September, the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/) reported that forty-two per cent of Americans who use the Web site said that they had at some point taken a break of at least several weeks from Facebook; twenty-six per cent said that they had deleted it from their phones. Since then, Facebook has suffered the largest [data breach](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-serious-is-the-new-facebook-breach) in its history, which affected an estimated fifty million users. Last month, the *Times* revealed that Facebook asked a political opposition-research firm to investigate and undercut its critics, in particular George Soros, a frequent target of anti-Semitic attacks.\n\nThe companyâs reach remains incomparably vast, with at least 2\\.2 billion users around the world, and most of its recent growth has been in foreign countries, where people arenât following every tidbit of scandal in the D.C. courts or the *Times*. But the damage to its reputation among influential users is unmistakable. This week, Walter Mossberg, a pioneering tech journalist, [announced](https://www.facebook.com/waltmossberg1/posts/10161060096925063) that he was giving up Facebook because, as he wrote (on Facebook), âmy own values and the policies and actions of Facebook have diverged to the point where Iâm no longer comfortable here.â On Tuesday, it was [Cherâs turn](https://twitter.com/cher/status/1074941152279769088), in all caps on her favored platform, Twitter: âGETTING RID OF FACEBOOK ACCOUNT I DIDNT KNOW I HAD.â \n\nâTrust is slow to build and quick to be broken,â Simons told me. âA long-built reputation for honesty can be broken by a single lie, and a single betrayal can dash decadesâ worth of trust. It will take a lot for Facebook to regain broken trust.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f2bfcc72cd92d0533","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Data Privacy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"data-privacy"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02cf1c7a8e33fb390be6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Evan Osnos joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2008 and covers politics and foreign affairs.

Things are now worse than worse. On Tuesday, the [*Times* published an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html) with further revelations about how Facebook exploited user data to fuel its business growth. âThese stories are coming out literally every day, or every couple of days, and there is this sense that weâre getting inured,â Halpern told me, on Wednesday morning. But each revelation matters and adds to what we know about the practices of Facebook and other tech firms that have become integral to our lives.\n\n \n\nThe *Timesâs* new article, citing internal company documents, reports that Facebook has provided other large companies with more access to its usersâ data than it has previously admitted. âFacebook allowed Microsoftâs Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook usersâ friends without consent,â the article says, giving examples, âand gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook usersâ private messages.â The company entered into so many of these âpartnershipsâ with other companies that its employees built a tool to keep track of them all. Facebook still maintains that it has never sold its usersâ data. But Halpern says that the pattern is now clear enough to call out. âFacebook uses language to circumvent the truth,â Halpern told me. âThey say, âWe donât sell your data.â And then youâre thinking, huh, thatâs interestingâthen why does everyone have my data? And the reason is that theyâve created a barter economy. They enter into these agreements in which the currency isnât dollars, itâs you, or your stuff, whatever they think is valuable about you.â\n\n \n\nAccording to the *Times*, Facebookâs partnerships âhelped drive the platformâs expansion, bringing in new users, spurring them to spend more time on Facebook and driving up advertising revenue.â The term âpartnershipâ itself is loaded, Halpern said. âInstead of calling these partners third partiesâtheyâre not allowed to give data to third partiesâthey call them part of Facebook,â Halpern said. âWeâve got this semantic slope that theyâve put themselves on that they use to slide into what they call compliance.â But, with every revelation, the 2011 Federal Trade Commission consent agreement that Facebook entered intoâwhich was supposed to safeguard user privacyâlooks less and less adequate. Former F.T.C. officials told the *Times* that the partnership deals detailed in its article âprobably violated the agreement.â\n\n \n\nEven before the *Timesâs* latest report, the calls for government regulation of Facebook and other big tech companies were getting louder and coming from lawmakers in both major parties. Halpern mentioned a bill proposed by the Democratic senator Ron Wyden, of Oregonâthe Consumer Data Protection Actâthat would impose long prison sentences on executives of tech companies that commit privacy or cybersecurity violations. âItâs probably not going to pass,â Halpern said. âItâs almost brutal.â Still, she said, âThis is not a problem that is going to be solved simply by me or you deleting our Facebook accounts. Although that, too, does send Facebook a message.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c8441e4c73c088d7773","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cybersecurity","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cybersecurity"},{"id":"5c2e1c8441c92e2c9b85da2f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Regulation","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"regulation"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c78ee7fe02cbd163327","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Privacy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"privacy"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Technology","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"technology"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a69d2e2e17730741c68c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Eric Lach writes and edits [The Current](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current), *The New Yorkerâs* online news and current-events column.

Six months later, at the end of January, biologists attending the Trinational Monarch Science Meeting, in Mexico City, confirmed what I and many others had been seeing throughout the summer and fall: the eastern monarch population was a hundred and forty-four per cent larger than it had been a year earlier. The announcement offered a modicum of hope amid dire warnings of mass extinctions and ecological catastrophe. Just two weeks earlier, the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation had issued a finding that the monarch population west of the Rockies dropped by around ninety per cent in the past year and is on the verge of collapse.\n\nMonarch butterflies migrate. Though they weigh less than a gram, they travel thousands of miles each fall to overwintering sites that provide the right microclimate to enable them to survive for months with little food or water. To track these migration patterns, citizen scientists have been gluing small tags on monarchsâ wings since the nineteen-fifties. The data from recovered tags is continually overlaid on maps that show where the butterflies are going and where they are coming from. Thatâs how we now know that monarchs east of the Rockies typically start the journey in Canada and the upper Midwest, aiming for the Oyamel-fir forests in Mexicoâs Transverse Neovolcanic Mountains. In the spring, the butterflies lay eggs in Texas before dying; successive generations move northward in a kind of relay race that follows the proliferation of milkweed, their host plant. Monarchs that begin their journey west of the Rockies do something similar: after wintering on the coast of California, shielded by stands of eucalyptus or Monterey pine, they move inland to the Central Valley, but also north to Washington State and southern British Columbia, and to Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, and possibly Montana.\n\nOne day in July, walking around our pond as my dog hunted for frogs, I watched two monarchs mate overhead, and, when they separated, I followed the female as she laid an egg on the underside of a nearby milkweed leaf. Milkweed is the monarchâs host plant because it contains a toxin that is poisonous to the butterflyâs predators. Monarch caterpillars chew the leaves and ingest the poison, which will protect the butterflies that they eventually become. I took the leaf with the egg and brought it inside. \n\nFour days later, the egg, which was white and approximately the size of a grain of sand, was gone, and in its place, barely visible, was the tiniest yellow-black-and-white caterpillar, so small that my husband had no idea where it was when I showed him. A few days, a few molts, and a few milkweed leaves later, the caterpillar was about a half-inch long and fattening up, following a timetable nearly as reliable as a Swiss watch. Another molt followed, and the caterpillar unzipped, then discarded, its striped jacket. Underneath, there was an identical one, one size larger. This phase of the metamorphosis happened to coincide with the death of Lincoln Brower, an emeritus professor of zoology who the *Times*, in its obituary, rightly called the âchampion of the Monarch butterfly.â I attached a small sign, which read âThe Lincoln Bedroom,â to the enclosure that Iâd made for the caterpillar. I started to refer to the caterpillar as Lincoln, tooâan anthropomorphism that I hoped Professor Brower, with whom Iâd travelled to Mexico a number of times to see the butterflies, would have forgiven.\n\nIn 1995, Brower, who was then at the University of Florida, published a paper in the *Journal of the Lepidopteristsâ Society*, explaining that while the monarch butterfly was not an endangered speciesâit can also be found in Hawaii, the Caribbean, Spain, Portugal, Australia and New Zealandâits North American migration patterns east of the Rockies were at grave risk of disappearing. In that paper, he called it an âendangered biological phenomenon.â Less than two decades later, in 2013, that danger appeared to have come to fruition, when that winterâs monarch population covered less than three acres of the Mexican forest, down from around twenty acres ten years earlier.\n\nAt the recent Monarch Science meeting, in Mexico City, when researchers reported that this yearâs migration covered six hectares, or nearly fifteen acres, âpeople were cheering,â Chip Taylor, an emeritus professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Kansas, said. This year was not only a banner year for eastern monarchs, it was one for tagging as well. According to Taylor, who, since 1992, has run Monarch Watch, the most prolific monarch-tagging program in the world, four hundred thousand tags were distributed in 2018, one and a half times as many as the year before. Lincoln Browerâs great friend and occasional collaborator, the Mexican poet Homero Aridjis, another monarch champion, told me in an e-mail that he was seeing aggregations of monarchs in the mountains near his boyhood home of Contepec for the first time in a decade.\n\nThough this is all encouraging, a single year is not a trend, and scientists remain concerned about the viability of the migration. âWe should celebrate the fact that we go up to this six-hectare number, and people who are living in areas where monarchs breed really noticed them this summer,â Karen Oberhauser, the director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum, who researches monarchs, told me. âIt illustrates the fact that they have this incredible potential.â But a population swing in the opposite direction can happen, too, she said. Oberhauser and her research associates have found that there is an underlying threat from habitat loss. (One study estimated that two hundred and twenty three million milkweed stems were lost in the Midwest between 2008 and 2016.) According to the World Wildlife Fund, six hectares is just enough to sustain a viable population in North America.\n\nTaylor has a one-word explanation for why 2018 was an especially good year for eastern monarchs, and why that good year likely portends bad ones to come: temperature. In March, when the monarchs arrived in Texas from Mexico, the mean temperatures were 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, which should have blown the butterflies all the way to Kansas.The butterflies couldnât go farther north, though, because it was too cold in northern Texas. âI looked at the weather every day and Iâd say, âdamn, thatâs good. Keep your babies in Texas,ââ Taylor said. In May, the temperatures were optimal as the butterflies moved north, and they were ideal in the summer as monarchs spread out across their breeding range. Then, in the fall, as the butterflies headed south, those numbers were favorable, too. âWhat we had this year is everything was positive in every one of those stages,â Taylor told me. âThis is why I say this is not likely to happen againâbecause youâre not likely to see a pattern like this again.â\n\nWest of the Rockies, the number of monarchs overwintering in California is estimated to be around twenty thousand, down eighty-six per cent since last year, which âisnât completely unprecedented,â Emma Pelton, a researcher with the Xerces Society, told me. âIâve looked back at data between 1980 and today, and there have been other instances where weâve had a single-year drop of this magnitude. But the difference is that this is all in the context of a ninety-seven per cent decline since the nineteen-eighties.â The current situation, Pelton added, is considered âa quasi-extinction.â  There may not be enough butterflies to repopulate the range. If that happens, there will still be western monarchs, but they will be increasingly hard to find. âThat would be like losing all the rhinos, except the rhinos in the zoos,â Pelton said. âReally, the threat is that weâre going to lose migration.â \n\nIn many ways, the stressors compromising western monarchs are the same as those affecting monarchs east of the Rockies: habitat loss both in the overwintering sites and along the migratory pathways; the proliferation of herbicides and insecticides, especially in wide swaths of the agricultural Midwest and the Central Valley; and increased temperatures due to climate change. But added to these are a protracted drought, enormous wildfires, and the propagation of non-native, tropical milkweed that carries a deadly parasite. Monarchs are âa very resilient species,â Taylor said. âIt survived long periods of negative conditions.â The question now, in the western United States, is if the butterflies are resilient enough to rebound from such a precipitous decline.\n\nRobert Michael Pyle, the founder of the Xerces Society and an expert on the western monarch migration, thinks that they may be, but for an unlikely reason. The western migration may be an accident of happenstance, and its fate may be tied to the fate of the eastern monarchs in the Mexican mountains. âI have long thought that the Californian wintering monarchs may be an epiphenomenonâa more or less ephemeral state, subject to radical fluctuations, perhaps even extinction and recolonization,â Pyle wrote in an e-mail. It wasnât until 1816 that the existence of monarchs in California entered the written record, when they were observed by Russian naturalists on an expedition to circumnavigate the globe. Earlier accounts of the region, dating back to the seventeenth century, by Native Americans, early explorers, and priests sent by the Catholic Church to establish missions, make no mention of the butterflies, leading Pyle to suggest that the western migration âmight not even be that old.â \n\nâLincoln Brower and I have hypothesized that it may have blinked on and off in the past, having been refreshed by chance incursions of Mexican monarchs pushed westerly in the spring by shifting winds,â Pyle wrote. Between 1990 and 1997, he added, the population of California monarchs crashed nearly as severely as it did in 2018, and then recovered. âSo, while I cannot say whether the current crash is systemic and lethal or stochastic and recoverable, I suspect the latter,â he said, âAnd I am very hopeful that the higher numbers in Mexico this winter might be propitiously poised to aid in Californian recovery next spring. It all depends on which way the wind blows.âÂ \n\nThe wind was not blowing at all inside the Lincoln Bedroom as the caterpillar chewed through milkweed leaves and grew proportionately. Outside, in the yard, the butterflies and caterpillars continued to multiply, though predators were quick to find the larvae, and the mortality rate, by my informal daily observations, was high. Then, about two weeks after emerging from his egg, Lincoln climbed to the top of the enclosure, secreted a white gooey liquid, attached himself to it, and then hung like a solitary letter âJ.â Days later, he appeared to turn himself inside out and then disappeared into a green, gold-flecked chrysalis. He was gone, though it was not clear where, exactly, heâd gone to.\n\nAnd then I waited, checking the chrysalis obsessively, even though I knew it would be at least a week before a butterfly emerged. Ten days later, I awoke to find the chrysalis transparent, and the black and orange of the monarchâs wings visible through it. Rebirth was imminent, or so I thought. More waiting, more watching, some worryingâIâd had monarchs die before, hanging stillborn in their cradles. But, on the fourteenth day, I witnessed Lincoln break through what now appeared to be the thinnest of membranes, clinging to it for quite a while, his wings still soft and folded. And then, as if someone were pumping them up, they unfurled and began to take shape.  As they did, I noticed from the absence of pheromone patches, that Lincoln was a she, not a he.\n\nI asked Oberhauser, who has devoted most of her professional life to monarch butterflies, why anyone should care if the monarch population crashes, in Mexico or out West. âWe can look at a species and say itâs important because itâs a pollinator or itâs a keystone species, and if we pull it out of an ecosystem itâs going to have all these harmful, cascading effects,â she said. âMonarchs probably donât have big-picture ecosystem importance. But just the fact that they connect people to nature is reason enough to make us care.â At one point, she told me, âWhen we lose these strong connections with nature, from the point of view of conservation, we lose one of our most important strengths. When people stop caring, things are going to get worse a lot faster.â\n\nOnce Lincolnâs wings hardened, I carried her and her bedroom outdoors, opened the enclosure, and got ready for her to fly away.

They were headed toward the Dolpo region of the Tibetan plateau. Schaller wanted to study Himalayan blue sheep; Matthiessen hoped to see a snow leopardâa large, majestic cat with fur the color of smoke. Snow leopards, which belong to the genus *Panthera*, inhabit some of the highest mountain ranges in the world, and their camouflage is so perfectly tuned that they appear ethereal, as though made from storm clouds. Two of them feature on the Tibetan flag of independence, representing harmony between the temporal and spiritual planes.\n\nFor Matthiessen, a serious student of Zen Buddhism, the expedition wasnât strictly scientific. It was also a pilgrimage during which he would seek to break âthe burdensome armor of the ego,â perceiving his âtrue nature.â After it was published, in 1978âfirst, in part, [in *The New Yorker*](http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1978-03-27#folio=038), then as a bookââ[The Snow Leopard](https://www.amazon.com/Snow-Leopard-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143105515),â his account of the trip, won two National Book Awards, becoming both a naturalist and a spiritual classic. It overflows with crystalline descriptions of animals and mountains: âThe golden birds fall from the morning sun like blowing sparks that drop away and are extinguished in the dark,â Matthiessen writes. But itâs also an austere Buddhist memoir in which the snow leopard is as alluring and mysterious as enlightenment itself. \n\nWhen Matthiessen and Schaller set out on their trip, scientists knew virtually nothing about snow leopards. There were no accurate range maps or long-term studies; although the cat had been described as far back as 1775, Matthiessen tells us that only two Westerners had seen a wild snow leopard in the previous twenty-five years. One of them was Schaller, who took the first recorded photograph of a snow leopard, in Chitral Gol, Pakistan, in 1970. Four decades after âThe Snow Leopard,â Schaller says that the animal has grown only slightly less mysterious. âTo this day, doing a decent census is extraordinarily difficult,â he told me over the phone, from his home in New Hampshire. âThere are thousands and thousands of square miles that no one has ever checked. Nobody knows if the population has increased or decreased.â\n\nThe snow leopardâs habitat, which stretches across twelve Central Asian countries, is forbidding. The air is thin and temperatures fall to twenty below zero. In 1982, the biologist Rodney Jackson travelled to western Nepal to radio-collar some snow leopards; to get to the field site, he took a small plane from Kathmandu into western Nepal, then hiked for ten days. In four years, he collared only five animals. In 1993, Schallerâwho has returned to the Tibetan plateau almost every year since his trip with Matthiessenâinvited the biologist Tom McCarthy to Mongolia to study snow leopards. McCarthy, who is now the director of the snow-leopard program at the conservation organization Panthera, brought a copy of âThe Snow Leopardâ along for the plane ride, then grew alarmed after reading about a previous researcher who had gone into the field with Schaller, only to quit when his boots filled with blood. âI shut the book and didnât pick it up again for a few years,â he recalled.\n\nTracking snow leopards with radio is challenging because of the regionâs steep, rocky cliff faces, which scatter radio signals in all directions. âIn six years, I found the catsâ signals three hundred times,â McCarthy said. Since 2008, researchers in the southern Gobi region of Mongolia, not far from where McCarthy worked, have outfitted more than twenty snow leopards with G.P.S. collars, which send their exact positions to a satellite every few hours. âWhat I collected in six years, they collect in a week,â McCarthy said. But the new data only underscore the solitude of snow leopards and the vastness of their range. Except for an occasional shared meal at a kill site, the animals hunt and roam alone, and avoid contact by leaving behind scent-markings and scrapes that mark their territory. Every male requires around eighty square miles of home rangeâan area three and a half times the size of Manhattan. \n\nGathering blood, tissue, and genetic material from such a diffuse population is extraordinarily difficult. For some species, scat serves as a source of DNA, but in the Himalayas snow-leopard scat often freezes and stays frozen. As a result, âsnow-leopard poop from a hundred years ago may appear similar to snow-leopard poop from a year ago,â Evon Hekkala, an associate professor of biological science at Fordham University, said, making it hard to establish present-day population size or genetic diversity. Through limited sampling of the snow-leopard genome, researchers have discovered that, during the Pleistocene, the animals underwent a severe population decline that reduced their genetic variation. âItâs hard to estimate what the impact of that ancient loss of diversity has been,â Hekkala said. âWe still donât fully understand the adaptive potential of their genome.â\n\nIn 2016, Matthiessenâs son Alex, an environmentalist, joined Schaller to retrace the route described in âThe Snow Leopard.â He wrote about the experience in a special edition of the book, recently published by the Folio Society, that also includes reproductions of Schallerâs original photographs, from 1973. Throughout the trek, the younger Matthiessen noticed how many glaciers seemed diminished since those pictures had been taken. âThere are fewer snowy peaks, and less snow on the ones that do have cover,â he wrote. According to John Farrington, a wildlife researcher and conservationist who has studied snow leopards since 2000, climate change is already bringing about âthe drying up of surface-water sources, and the transformation of moist alpine meadows into less productive steppe-type ecosystems.â\n\nAs their habitat deteriorates, the cats may increase their predation of livestock, which tends to provoke retaliatory poaching. Last year, because the rate of their decline has lessened in some places since the fall of the Soviet Union, when the animals were more often poached, the International Union for Conservation of Nature downgraded the snow leopardâs status from âendangeredâ to âvulnerable.â But conservationists point out that less than two per cent of the speciesâs range has ever been rigorously sampled. âWhat you have to go by is, how fragmented are the populations?â Schaller told me. âYou can have a hundred tiny populations and they are all threatened, because of inbreeding, and so forth. Thereâs a lot of fragmentation in snow-leopard range, and there is going to be more with climate change.â\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nFarrington had studied snow leopards for sixteen years before he saw one in the wild; Tom McCarthy said it was not unusual for him to go five or six years between sightings. Matthiessen never saw one. âI always sensed that he was slightly embarrassed about it,â Alex told me, in an e-mail, âespecially given that Schaller did see a snow leopard days after my father departed for home.â And yet his father, he continued, âwell understood that, given the bookâs spiritual and philosophical themes, not seeing the snow leopard held more power symbolically than seeing it would have.â For Matthiessen, the animalâs elusiveness became a lesson in the Buddhist idea of nonattachmentâthe radical letting go of oneâs regrets about the past and dreams for the future, in order to be present in the here and now.\n\nIf Matthiessen had merely wanted to set eyes on a snow leopard, he could have driven from his home on Long Island to the Bronx Zoo, where snow leopards have been bred in captivity since 1966. In the past forty years, the greatest change for the species may be its growing accessibility to the tens of millions of people who visit zoos each year. When Matthiessen went to Dolpo, there were around ninety animals in captivity all over the world; today, there are more than six hundred, spread between a hundred and sixty zoos. (The zoo population could represent as much as fifteen per cent of all snow leopards globally.) The animals are carefully bred to maintain genetic diversity, and in 2012 researchers reported that they had induced snow-leopard ear cells to become stem cells, which could potentially be cryopreserved and used in future assisted reproductions. Like pandas and giraffes, snow leopards are now on divergent trajectories. Even as they face looming threats in the wild, they are surviving sustainably in captivity, under increasingly direct human management.\n\nAs Matthiessen would have been the first to point out, seeing an animal in its natural habit and visiting one in a zoo are not the same thing. Only the former activity requires us to search and, in the process, to become seekers. Much of âThe Snow Leopardâ is about the difference between the physical act of seeing something and the more profound, spiritual act of perceiving it. The latter, Matthiessen thought, requires escaping oneâs ego-bound point of view in order to appreciate the unity of life, which âman must perceive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if he is to transcend his fear of meaninglessness, for no amount of âprogressâ can take its place.â In the Himalayas, Matthiessen hoped that the wildness and independence of the snow leopard might shock him out of the prison of his ego. âIf the snow leopard should leap from the rock above and manifest itself before me,â he wrote, âthen in that moment of pure fright, out of my wits, I might truly perceive it, and be free.â It never happened. Still, on his descent toward home, Matthiessen became overwhelmed with a feeling of lightness, accepting that the journey itself was âthe Jewel in the Heart of the Lotus, the Tao, the Way, the Path, but no more so than small events of days at home.â\n\nSince Matthiessenâs death, from leukemia, in 2014, itâs become easier to read âThe Snow Leopardâ as a book about mortality. The year before he and Schaller embarked on their journey, Matthiessenâs wife, Deborah Love, died of cancer. In the mountains, where he searched for the ego death that would accompany enlightenment, Matthiessen carried the Tibetan Book of the Dead in his pack, and ruminated on what Schaller called the âgreat dyingâ of the Himalayan landscape. Even in the nineteen-seventies, Matthiessen believed that the wilderness he travelled through would likely disappear by centuryâs end.\n\nItâs still thereâjust. âThe Snow Leopard,â meanwhile, has acquired a new meaning: itâs become a prescient exploration of how we might confront the dire reality of climate change without shying away from either natureâs profound beauty or our own sadness. âI believe that when it came to the environment, he was depressed about it like the rest of us,â Alex wrote to me. âLike I do, he despaired to no end about the fact that we will cause the extinction of the polar bearâat least in the wildâand ultimately tens of thousands of other species, once climate change fully expresses itself.â The challenge, Alex continued, âis to embrace all of it, not to fight or cling to notions of what should have been or what must be. But to live in this moment right now and to be fully present for it and each moment that comes after.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a76dda97f12ef9160a3e","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/m-r-oconnor","email":"","name":"M.

Church is a pioneer in genetic technologyâhe helped develop the *CRISPR*{:.small}-Cas9 technology that a researcher in China recently used on the worldâs first [genetically edited newborns](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/he-jiankui-and-the-implications-of-experimenting-with-genetically-edited-babies)âand, in his lab, scientists are working on bringing the prehistoric pachyderm back from extinction. The process would involve adding certain mammoth genetic adaptations, like a long, dense pelt and layers of insulating fat, to the DNA of Asian elephants, which share more than ninety-nine per cent of their DNA with their extinct cousins. Church and Brand have a vision of herds of future mammoths grazing the steppes of the far north. \n\nChurchâs woolly mammoth research is just one of several de-extinction projectsâthere are about ten underway nowâthat aim to use genetics to restore lost species. In her book â[The Re-Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/Re-Origin-Species-second-extinct-animals/dp/194753436X),â the Swedish science journalist Torill Kornfeldt travels the world meeting the scientists and conservationists involved in this movement. In California, she talks with Ben Novak, a scientist obsessed with bringing back the passenger pigeonâa bird that once travelled in flocks that were so giant and dense, Novak tells her, that they âswept through the landscape, with the same effect as forest fires.â In upstate New York, a researcher is working toward restoring the American chestnut, which was decimated by blight in the late eighteen-hundreds. Until then, chestnuts were so prevalent in the eastern half of the United States that, when their white blossoms fell in the spring, the hillsides looked like they were covered in snow; in the fall, their sweet, starchy nuts served as a free, abundant harvest. At Australiaâs Sea Simulator aquarium, resurrection scientists are working on coral, which faces an existential threat from the rapid warming and acidifying of ocean waters. These researchers want to help coral avoid extinction by âtrying to nudge evolution,â imbuing them with traits that will allow them to survive the hotter oceans of the future. \n\nSome of the projects Kornfeldt writes about are incredibly compelling, given that we are living through a [mass-extinction event](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/25/the-sixth-extinction) that threatens the stability of the worldâs ecosystems. But de-extinctionâs appeal also works on a much smaller scale: who wouldnât want to restore the beautiful chestnut to its former, generous glory? It disappeared from the Eastern forests so recently that, in some places, intact root systems still push up new saplings that grow briefly before succumbing to the blight that still lives in other, unaffected trees. And Kornfeldtâs account of seeing one of the last living northern white rhinocerosesâan elderly female called Nola, lumbering around her zoo enclosure, rotund and majesticâframes de-extinction as not just an ecological service but a rescue mission for individual creatures. By the time the book went to press, Nola had died, but cells of some of the last of her kind live on in the Frozen Zoo, a San Diego facility where eggs, sperm, and embryos from thousands of threatened or extinct species are kept in cold storage. Those tiny cells contain a world of possibility and rebirth, held in limbo under a layer of liquid nitrogen. \n\nNola makes for a charismatic ambassador of de-extinction, but some of the other projects raise big questions, both ethical and practical. Itâs hard to imagine how one might go about introducing herds of woolly mammoths in the near-future Arctic: If the mammoths make it into existence, will temperatures in the far north still be cold enough to sustain a habitat for them? And just whose land do these giant herd animals get to graze? Meanwhile, the passenger pigeons, which used to descend in flocks that left areas picked clean and covered in guano, sound less Garden of Eden than Biblical plague. Another Harvard researcher, Arkhat Abzhanov, is modifying chicken embryos to make them more like their dinosaur ancestors; he likens his research to âexamining birdsâ family tree by moving backwards along the branches.â Abzhanov doesnât let the embryos hatch, and itâs not clear that their mix of genetic features would allow them to function if they did. Kornfeldt writes that âchicken-sized dinosaur pets might sell like hot cakesâ and âbe delightfully harmlessââbut if such animals were to be brought into the world, what would they be? Itâs impossible not to think of Frankensteinâs monster, in both the creatureâs monstrosity and its suffering.  \n\nItâs this tensionâeven more than the specifics surrounding the revival of any one speciesâthat carries Kornfeldtâs stories along: she constantly pursues the question of what all of this means for humanityâs relationship to nature. To bring species backâfrom extinction or from its brinkâis a godlike power. Stewart Brand, ever bullish on human potential, has said, âWe are as gods and have to get good at it.â He sees species revival as part of a tech-forward approach to environmentalism. âBiotech has an enormous amount to bring to conservation,â he told me. We already wipe species out on the regular, so if weâre going to have godlike power, why not wield it intentionally and responsibly? \n\nBen Minteer, a professor of environmental ethics and one of the few de-extinction critics featured in the book, points out the danger of humanity becoming âmesmerised by its own power.â He recommends an âearthly modestyâ: instead of trying to engineer our way out of planetary ruin by further altering nature, we should scale back destruction instead. The debate calls to mind what Bill McKibben wrote, in 1989, in â[The End of Nature](http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1989-09-11#folio=072)â: âWe have deprived nature of its independence, and that is fatal to its meaning. Natureâs independence *is* its meaning.â By changing the climate through carbon emissions, he wrote, humanity had infiltrated every part of the wilderness, leaving nothing untouched. The same idea applies here. Whatever any of these genetically resurrected species might be, they wonât be part of nature.                                                                                                \n\n-=-=-=-\n\nReading the science of de-extinction can inspire a lot of hopeânot necessarily about the species themselves, but for demonstrating how relatively fast an area of science can develop. (The first genetically engineered plant was created in the early eighties. The human genome was sequenced in 2003\\. In 2006, a technique was developed to turn specialized cells into stem cells.) Thereâs an element of serendipity to scientific discovery, but that kind of progress doesnât happen by accidentâitâs the result of the concentrated effort that happens when broad swaths of society decide to make something a priority. In the nineties, the Human Genome Project was the new moon landing, publicly funded with almost three billion dollars from the U.S. government, and running alongside parallel projects supported by private corporations and other governments. When the first sequencing was complete, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair announced it together at the White House, using language that was [heraldic even for Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse3.archives.gov/WH/Work/062600.html): âWe are learning the language in which God created life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With this profound new knowledge, humankind is on the verge of gaining immense, new power to heal.â \n\nReading about the ways that bold, public investment in genetics has paid off, I canât help but wish for the same level of investmentâin public attention, funding, enthusiasmâto be directed toward the scientific approaches that are necessary to decarbonize the economy, shift global energy patterns, and mitigate climate change. The research into [carbon capture](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/can-carbon-dioxide-removal-save-the-world) and zero-emissions energy should attract the very best minds; the work should be lavished with public attention, funding, and enthusiasm. The Human Genome Project and the moon landing were the big, showy results that bloomed out of decades of research; viable technological climate fixes wonât just appear overnight. And, with Trump in the White House and his climate-denying appointees running energy and environmental policy, such a shift is its own kind of [moon shot](https://www.gq.com/story/green-new-deal-explainer?verso=true). But the advocates of a [Green New Deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/creating-a-road-map-for-a-green-new-deal), such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are thinking on this kind of scale. As Robinson Meyer writes in [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-winning-climate-strategy/576514/), âIn the 1960s, the U.S. pointed the full power of its military-technological industry at going to the moon. Ocasio-Cortez wants to do the same thing, except to save the planet.â\n\nAs it turns out, the mammoths themselves could have a role to play in combating climate change. A main reason for the interest in bringing back the woolly mammothâor in introducing some new, mammothlike elephantâis its potential impact on the climate. At a nature reserve in Siberia called Pleistocene Park, the father and son scientists, Nikita and Sergey Zimov, are leading the effort to protect the permafrost with grazing herbivores. (My colleague Elizabeth Kolbert first [wrote about Pleistocene Park](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/recall-of-the-wild) in this magazine in 2012\\.) The permafrost, a thick layer of soil, sediment or rock that stays frozen year-round, is thawing. And that makes people nervous, because as it melts it will release a great quantity of greenhouse-gas emissions. Herbivores help because, in the winter, they act like snow plows, kicking up the snow and compacting it in their efforts to get to the grass beneath, exposing the ground to the frigid air and keeping it frozen. Inside the park, a mix of horses, elk, reindeer, oxen, and a lone bison roam and graze, and have restored the grassland by clearing it of scrubby bushes. Brand calls Pleistocene Park âone of the most gonzo pieces of science ever,â and, according to Nikita Zimov, itâs already working: the permafrost half a meter below the surface is seventeen degrees colder inside the park than it is outside. Mammoths, one imagines, would be even better snow-tramplers. George Church, a genetics pioneer and an eternal optimist, sums it up, though perhaps with some hyperbole: âSo it could be mammoths that save the climate.â \n\nOf course, Churchâs optimism might not be borne out. But Zimovâs anecdotal results are shored up by a new paper, [published, on December 6th, in *Science*](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/ysof-cpa120518.php), that shows that the presence of animals in an ecosystem can have dramatic impacts on landscapesâeven swinging them from being net carbon emitters to carbon sinks. But they can also do the reverse, depending on the vegetation, the animal, and a host of other factors. This finding reverses the conventional wisdom around climate modelling, that âlow-abundantâ animal populations canât impact an ecosystemâs carbon cycling the way that carbon-storing plants and carbon-gushing humans do. âSome of us have been saying for a long time that itâs not just animal abundance that matters but what these animals do that is important,â Oswald J. Schmitz, the studyâs lead author, said in a release. \n\nHumans have long been managers of nature. In the Serengeti, at the turn of the twentieth century, the wildebeest population was decimated by a cattle virus in less than a decade. Carcasses dotted the savanna. Without the grazers keeping grass in check, an overgrowth of dry ground vegetation set the stage for devastating wildfires. When the herds recovered, however, more carbon was recycled and kept in the landscape, turning the savanna back to a carbon sink. The herds made their comeback after a vaccination campaignâa de-extinction project of a different sort.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1c79397f5b30646d05e8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Extinction","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"extinction"},{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a244997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Animals","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"animals"}],"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7d92e2e17730741c744","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-riederer","email":"","name":"Rachel Riederer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Rachel Riederer is a member of The New Yorkerâs editorial staff.
