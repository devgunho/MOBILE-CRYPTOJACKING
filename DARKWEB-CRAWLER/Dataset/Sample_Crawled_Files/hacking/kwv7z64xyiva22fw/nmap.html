		<P><!---->The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs from other security lists in its open nature and support for researchers' right to decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure">full disclosure movement</a> has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure their products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide them.  Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated here!<br><br>This list is meant as a spiritual successor to the <a href="http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html">grok.org.uk Full-Disclosure list</a> started by Len Rose and John Cartwright in 2002 and <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332">terminated abruptly in March 2014</a> due to bogus legal threats. We are giving this list a fresh start, so members of the old list need to resubscribe here.<br><br>This list is run by and for the network security community.  Moderation is performed by a team of volunteers using our <a href="https://secwiki.org/w/FD_Moderation">moderation guidelines</a>.  Time is truly of the essence in vulnerability disclosure, so we try to keep the moderation delay short.  When we need more moderators we will recruit from the most active and insightful list members.<br><br>You must join the list before you can post to it.  Submit posts to <a href="mailto:fulldisclosure@seclists.org">fulldisclosure@seclists.org</a>.  If you don't want list message delivery to the address you post from, you can disable it in <a href="https://nmap.org/mailman/options/fulldisclosure">list config</a>.<br><br>Posts are publicly archived at the <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure">Seclists.org Full Disclosure web archive</a> and the list RSS feed is available there too.  Various unofficial archives exist as well.  You can prevent archiving (at least for Seclists) by specifying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-No-Archive">X-No-Archive mail header</a> in your post, but you might reconsider whether to post such a sensitive message to a public list in the first place.<br><br>Given the light moderation policy and that we generally don't verify posted information, and that email forgery is easy, deal with all list content at your own risk!  In particular, running any "exploit scripts" or executables posted to this list can be disastrous.<!----></P>

		<P><!---->The Nmap dev list is intended to facilitate the<br>development of the free Nmap Security Scanner.  It provides an<br>unmoderated forum for people to contribute ideas, patches,<br>suggestions, etc.  We also discuss the pros and cons of proposed<br>changes to Nmap.  Thus this list also serves as a sort of<br>developmental "steering committee".  New (test/beta) versions of<br>Nmap may sometimes be released here prior to general availability<br>for quality assurance purposes.<br><br>Anyone hardcore enough to subscribe to nmap-dev should probably also<br>subscribe to the Nmap announcement list<br>(https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce), a moderated list for<br>Nmap-related announcements.<br><br>This list is reasonably high volume (sometimes 10+ posts per<br>day).  Archives are available at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/.<br>Non-members can post, but such posts go through moderation to<br>prevent spam.<!----></P>

<A NAME="intro"></A>
<h1 class="purpleheader">Introduction</h1>

<BR>

<P>Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source
(<a href="/data/COPYING">license</a>) utility for
network discovery and security auditing.  Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime.  Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.  It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts.  Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X.  In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
(<a href="/zenmap/">Zenmap</a>), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
(<a href="/ncat/">Ncat</a>), a utility for
comparing scan results (<a href="/ndiff/">Ndiff</a>), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (<a href="/nping/">Nping</a>).

<P>Nmap was named &ldquo;Security Product of the Year&rdquo; by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest.  It
was even featured in <a href="/movies/">twelve
movies</a>, including
<a href="/movies/#matrix">The Matrix Reloaded</a>,
<a href="/movies/#diehard4">Die Hard 4</a>,
<a href="/movies/#gwtdt">Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>,
 and
<a href="/movies/#bourne">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>.


<P>Nmap is ...

<span style="display:none" property="name">Nmap</span>
<span style="display:none" property="applicationCategory">Security</span>
<span style="display:none" property="applicationSubCategory">Port Scanner</span>
<LI><B>Flexible</B>: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
other obstacles.  This includes many <A
HREF="/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html">port scanning</A> mechanisms (both TCP &amp;
UDP), <A HREF="/book/osdetect.html">OS
detection</A>, <A HREF="/book/vscan.html">version detection</A>, ping sweeps, and more. See the <A
HREF="/docs.html">documentation page</a>.

<LI><B>Powerful</B>: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
literally hundreds of thousands of machines.

<LI><B>Portable</B>: Most operating systems are supported, including
<span property="operatingSystem">Linux</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Microsoft Windows</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">FreeBSD</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">OpenBSD</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Solaris</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">IRIX</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Mac OS X</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">HP-UX</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">NetBSD</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Sun OS</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Amiga</span>,
and more.

<LI><B>Easy</B>: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap&nbsp;-v&nbsp;-A&nbsp;<I>targethost</I>".  Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
versions are available to suit your preference.  Binaries are
available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.

<LI><B>Free</B>: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
the Internet a little more secure and to provide
administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
their networks.  Nmap is available for <A
HREF="https://nmap.org/download.html" property="downloadUrl">free download</A>, and also comes with full
source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
the <a href="data/COPYING" property="license">license</a>.

<LI><B>Well Documented</B>: Significant effort has been put into
comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
even a whole book!  Find them in multiple
languages <A HREF="/docs.html">here</A>.

<LI><B>Supported</B>: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users.  Most of this interaction occurs on the <A
HREF="#lists">Nmap mailing lists</A>.  Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the <a href="https://seclists.org/nmap-dev">nmap-dev list</a>, but only after you read the <a href="/book/man-bugs.html">guidelines</a>.  We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic <a href="https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers">nmap-hackers</a> announcement list. You can also find Nmap on <a href="http://facebook.com/nmap">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nmap">Twitter</a>. For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> or <a href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFNet</a>.

<LI><B>Acclaimed</B>: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
<span propery="award">"Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal</span>, Info
World and Codetalker Digest.  It has been featured in hundreds of
magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
series.  Visit the <A HREF="nmap_inthenews.html">press page</A>
for further details.

<LI><B>Popular</B>: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc).  It is among the top ten (out of
30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository.  This is important
because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
communities.

<h1 class="purpleheader">Communication</h1>

<P>Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the <I>Nmap-hackers</I>
mailing list.  It is a low volume (8 posts in 2016), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects.  You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

<P><center>
<FORM Method=POST ACTION="https://nmap.org/mailman/subscribe/announce">
<INPUT type="Text" name="email" size="25" value="">
<font color="#000000"><INPUT type="Submit" name="email-button" value="Subscribe to Nmap-hackers"></font><BR>
(or subscribe with custom options from the <a href="https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">Nmap-hackers list info page</a>)
</FORM>
</center>

<P>We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc.  New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes.  You can subscribe at the <a
href="https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev">Nmap-dev list
info page</a>.

<P>Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at <A HREF="https://seclists.org">Seclists.org</A>.

<P>Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> (irc.freenode.net).

          <p><strong>NOTE: This is most likely a <code>wontfix</code> issue, as it would require lots of major changes to how Nmap does things.</strong> This issue entry is mostly for discussion of the idea and alternatives.</p>
<h2>The feature</h2>
<p>Many users have asked for capability for Nmap to scan differing sets of ports on separate targets within a single scan. This capability is described in a couple of different ways, depending on the use case:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user has the results of a previous scan and wants to verify if the opened ports are still open.</li>
<li>The user has a list of hostnames and port numbers and wants to run version detection or a NSE script against each of them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The common feature of these use cases is that some port numbers will be scanned for some targets, but not for all targets. Regardless of input mechanism (usually described as from a file, either one target &amp; port per line or previous Nmap output), the result is the same: not all ports are scanned on all targets.</p>
<h2>The challenges</h2>
<p>The primary difficulty here is that Nmap's core scan engine, <code>ultrascan</code>, takes one set of ports and one list of targets as input. It would have to be reworked generally to accept per-target port lists, and the data structures would have to be modified. The port lists are not small (see the <code>struct scan_lists</code> structure; each of the lists pointed to is heap-allocated 64 KB) when considering duplicating them for each target.</p>
<p>An additional difficulty is clarity in output. With current Nmap output, one can look at the invocation (or the list of ports scanned in the XML or verbose Grepable formats) to see which ports were scanned for any target; if the "Not shown: 998 closed ports" line shows, you can subtract the 2 shown ports and arrive at which ports are closed. If the set of scanned ports is different for each target, we will have to update the output to include the list of scanned ports for every target.</p>
<h2>The alternatives</h2>
<p>A big reason to avoid the difficulty of implementing this is that in most cases described, simply scanning the "extra" ports is not that much of an additional burden. The default Nmap scan is 1000 ports per host, and it finishes fairly quickly for most targets, simply because most networks only have a small number of those ports open. So using some other means (command line processing, usually) to extract the list of open port numbers from the desired input will nearly always yield far fewer than 1000 ports, meaning shorter scan times overall.</p>
<p>Another point to consider is that in addition to some previously open ports being discovered as closed (the reason given for "verifying old scans"), it is just as likely that some previously closed ports will have become open, and limiting a scan to the particular ports that were previously open on each target will miss these.</p>
<p>A final alternative is to perform post-processing on the original scan output (or use the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/reverse-index.html" rel="nofollow">reverse-index</a> NSE script) to get a list of targets for each port number, then run a series of single-port scans to arrive at the desired results. This will usually result in fewer, simpler scans than scanning all the previously-open ports on a single target at a time, and can be faster, too, since the scan load is spread across many targets at once.</p>

          <p>Very thorough and insightful response - appreciate the effort, and totally understood that it may be a wontfix.</p>
<p>For the first two alternatives - the "not much of an additional burden to scan them all again" argument, and the "you might miss some" argument - I'd like to argue that there are other use cases in play for some users. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It may sometimes be the <em>noise</em> / <em>detectability</em> of the scan that the user wants to minimize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may not be "again". <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="smile" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png">ð</g-emoji>  For some use cases, there is value in assembling a list of targets &amp; ports to be used for an <em>initial</em> scan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The workaround - lots of single-port scans - would be the same for these, of course. :) But it may at least slightly shift the value proposition of bringing such functionality into nmap itself. :)</p>
<p>Also, naively: instead of modifying <code>ultrascan</code>, could a different structure entirely be invoked when importing this kind of target set?</p>

<p>Regarding using a different scan engine besides ultrascan: yes, there are a few other parts of Nmap that are built as separate scan engines, namely idle scan and FTP bounce scan. As a whole, though, the goal of Nmap's developers has been to unify scan engines into ultrascan, since it has some excellent properties like global congestion control and tunable timing that are tricky to work into new code.</p>

          <p>I've had situations where I've wanted this feature, but most of the time I've managed to work around it.</p>
<p>Let's say you've run an asynchronous port scanner such as masscan at a fixed rate across 1024 IP addresses (/22) with all 65536 TCP ports. Assume that in this scenario you don't mind sacrificing some accuracy for quicker results.</p>
<p>You then know (roughly) what ports are open on what IP addresses.</p>
<p>You could then run Nmap only against the specific set of open ports per IP address (what this feature request is about).</p>
<p>Instead, I just get the union of all open port numbers, and then run Nmap with that set of ports against the full range again (with service detection, version detection, scripts etc.). Usually, that set is less than 100 unique port numbers, and so the Nmap port scanning phase finishes fairly quickly. For me, this has worked well enough that I don't really feel the need for this feature anymore.</p>

  stability, as well as smoother installer and better 802.11 raw frame
  capturing support. Nmap 7.70 updates the bundled Npcap from version 0.93 to
  0.99-r2, including all these changes from the last seven Npcap releases:
  <a href="https://nmap.org/npcap/changelog">https://nmap.org/npcap/changelog</a>
</li><li>  Integrated all of your service/version detection fingerprints submitted from
  March 2017 to August 2017 (728 of them). The signature count went up 1.02%
  to 11,672, including 26 new softmatches.  We now detect 1224 protocols from
  filenet-pch, lscp, and netassistant to sharp-remote, urbackup, and
  watchguard.  We will try to integrate the remaining submissions in the next
  release.
</li><li>  Integrated all of your IPv4 OS fingerprint submissions from September 2016
  to August 2017 (667 of them). Added 298 fingerprints, bringing the new total
  to 5,652. Additions include iOS 11, macOS Sierra, Linux 4.14, Android 7, and
  more.
</li><li>  Integrated all 33 of your IPv6 OS fingerprint submissions from September
  2016 to August 2017. New groups for OpenBSD 6.0 and FreeBSD 11.0 were added,
  as well as strengthened groups for Linux and OS X.
</li><li>  Added the --resolve-all option to resolve and scan all IP addresses of a

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span><span class="cltag"><a href="http://issues.nmap.org/1129" name="gh-1129">[GH#1129]</a></span> Changed url.absolute() behavior with respect to dot and
  dot-dot path segments to comply with RFC 3986, section 5.2. [nnposter]
</li><li>  Removed deprecated and undocumented aliases for several long options that
  used underscores instead of hyphens, such as --max_retries. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Improved service scan&#39;s treatment of soft matches in two ways. First of all,
  any probes that could result in a full match with the soft matched service
  will now be sent, regardless of rarity.  This improves the chances of
  matching unusual services on non-standard ports.  Second, probes are now
  skipped if they don&#39;t contain any signatures for the soft matched service.
  Previously the probes would still be run as long as the target port number
  matched the probe&#39;s specification.  Together, these changes should make
  service/version detection faster and more accurate.  For more details on how
  it works, see <a href="https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html">https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html</a>. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  --version-all now turns off the soft match optimization, ensuring that all
  probes really are sent, even if there aren&#39;t any existing match lines for
  the softmatched service. This is slower, but gives the most comprehensive
  results and produces better fingerprints for submission. [Daniel Miller]

    [Jaromir Koncicky, Michal Hlavinka]
<li>    The --no-shutdown option now also works in connect mode, not only in listen mode.
<li>    Made -i/--idle-timeout not cause Ncat in server mode to close while
    waiting for an initial connection. This was also causing -i to interfere
    with the HTTP proxy server mode. [Carlos Manso, Daniel Miller]
<li>    <span class="cltag"><a href="http://issues.nmap.org/773" name="gh-773">[GH#773]</a></span> Ncat in server mode properly handles TLS renegotiations and other
    situations where SSL_read returns a non-fatal error. This was causing
    SSL-over-TCP connections to be dropped. [Daniel Miller]
<li>    Enable --ssl-ciphers to be used with Ncat in client mode, not only in

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Resolved several issues in the default HTTP redirect rules:
<ul><li><a href="http://issues.nmap.org/826" name="gh-826">[GH#826]</a> A redirect is now cancelled if the original URL contains

  not a string. [nnposter]
</li><li>  No longer allow ICMP Time Exceeded messages to mark a host as down during

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed several potential hangs in NSE scripts that used
  receive_buf(pattern), which will not return if the service continues to send
  data that does not match pattern. A new function in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/match.html">match.lua</a>, pattern_limit,
  is introduced to limit the number of bytes consumed while searching for the
  pattern. [Daniel Miller, Jacek Wielemborek]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Handle any and all socket connect errors the same: raise as an Nsock
  error instead of fatal. This prevents Nmap and Ncat from quitting with
  &quot;Strange error from connect:&quot; [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added several commands to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/redis-info.html">redis-info</a> to extract listening addresses,

  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-brute.html">mysql-brute</a> and other scripts due to including a null terminator in the salt
  value. This bug affects Nmap 7.25BETA2 and later releases.  [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  The --open option now implies --defeat-rst-ratelimit. This may result in
  inaccuracies in the numbers of &quot;Not shown:&quot; closed and filtered ports, but
  only in situations where it also speeds up scan times. [Daniel Miller]

  rights. [Yang Luo, Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag"><a href="http://issues.nmap.org/350" name="gh-350">[GH#350]</a></span> Fix an assertion failure due to floating point error in equality

  to use the correct brute-forced string for each host. [Gioacchino Mazzurco]
</li><li>  Several improvements to TLS/SSL detection in nmap-service-probes. A new
  probe, TLSSessionReq, and improvements to default SSL ports should help speed
  up -sV scans. <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2015/q2/17">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2015/q2/17</a> [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Clean up the API so that nsp_* calls are now nsock_pool_* and nsi_*

</li><li>  <span class="cltag"><a href="http://issues.nmap.org/181" name="gh-181">[GH#181]</a></span> The configure script now prints a summary of configured options.
  Most importantly, it warns if OpenSSL was not found, since most users will
  want this library compiled in. [Gioacchino Mazzurco]
</li><li>  Define TCP Options for SYN scan in nmap.h instead of literally throughout.
  This string is used by p0f and other IDS to detect Nmap scans, so having it a
  compile-time option is a step towards better evasion. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag"><a href="http://issues.nmap.org/51" name="gh-51">[GH#51]</a></span> Nmap&#39;s parallel reverse-DNS resolver now handles IPv6 addresses. This
  should result in faster -6 scans. The old behavior is available with
  --system-dns. [Gioacchino Mazzurco]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fix a couple odd bugs in NSE command-line parsing. Most notably,
  --script broadcast-* will now work (generally, wildcards with scripts whose
  name begins with a category name were not working properly). [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <span class="cltag"><a href="http://issues.nmap.org/113" name="gh-113">[GH#113]</a></span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-form-fuzzer.html">http-form-fuzzer</a> will now stop increasing the size of a
  request when an HTTP 413 or 414 error indicates the web server will not
  accept a larger request. [Gioacchino Mazzurco]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <span class="cltag"><a href="http://issues.nmap.org/159" name="gh-159">[GH#159]</a></span> Add the ability to tag credentials in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/creds.html">creds</a> library with
  freeform text for easy retrieval. This gives necessary granularity to track
  credentials to multiple web apps on a single host+port. [Gioacchino Mazzurco]

<li>  Work around a bug which could cause Nmap to hang when running
  multiple instances at once on Windows. The actual bug appears to be
  in the WinPCAP driver in that it hanges when accessed via
  OpenServiceA by multiple processes at once. So for now we have added
  a mutex to prevent even multiple Nmap processes from making
  concurrent calls to this part of WinPcap. We&#39;ve received the reports
  from multiple users on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 and

</li><li>  Our Windows Nmap packages are now compiled with the older platform

  Turtiainen. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Handle a bunch of socket errors that can result from odd ICMP Type 3
  Destination Unreachable messages received during service scanning. The crash
  reported was &quot;Unexpected error in NSE_TYPE_READ callback.  Error code: 92
  (Protocol not available)&quot; [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Fixed a crash (NULL pointer dereference) in PortList::isTCPwrapped when using
  -sV and -O on an unknown service not listed in nmap-services. [Pierre Lalet]
</li><li>  Fixed a benign TOCTOU race between stat() and open() in mmapfile().
  Reported by Camille Mougey. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  Reduce CPU consumption when using nsock poll engine with no registered FD,

  returning zero and entering the loop again. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  Change the URI for the fingerprint submitter to its new location at

</li><li>  Fixed a bug that caused Nmap to fail to find any network interface when a
  Prism interface is in monitor mode. The fix was to define the
  ARP_HRD_IEEE80211_PRISM header identifier in the libdnet-stripped code.
  [Brad Johnson]
</li><li>  Added a version probe for Tor. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Add support to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/citrix-enum-apps-xml.html">citrix-enum-apps-xml</a> for reporting if Citrix
  published applications in the list are enforcing/requiring the level
  of ICA/session data encryption shown in the script result.

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Add port.reason_ttl, host.reason, host.reason_ttl for use in scripts
  [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> If a version script is run by name, nmap.version_intensity() returns
  the maximum value (9) for it [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> shortport.version_port_or_service() takes an optional rarity parameter
  now to run only when version intensity &gt; rarity [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added nmap.version_intensity() function so that NSE version scripts
  can use the argument to --version-intensity (which can be overridden by the
  script arg &#39;script-intensity&#39;) in order to decide whether to run or not
  [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  Improve OS detection; If a port is detected to be &#39;tcpwrapped&#39;, then it will
  not be used for OS detection. This helps in cases where a firewall might be
  the port to be &#39;tcpwrapped&#39; [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Reduce noise generated in Topology View due to anonymous
  hops [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  Added option --exclude-ports to Nmap so that some ports can be excluded from
  scanning (for example, due to policy) [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Catch the MemoryError caused in Zenmap due to large Nmap Output,
  and display a more helpful error message [Jay Bosamiya]

  &quot;-oX -sV logfile.xml&quot;) [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Improved NmapParser to increase speed in opening scans. Large scans
  now open in seconds instead of hours. [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  Modify the included libpcap configure script to disable certain unused
  features: bluetooth, usb, usb-can, and dbus sniffing. Dbus support caused a
  build problem on CentOS 6.5. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Updated the bundled libpcap from 1.2.1 to 1.5.3 [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  Correct the Target MAC Address in Nmap&#39;s ARP discovery to conform to what IP
  stacks in currently popular operating systems use. [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which caused Nmap to be unable to have any runtime interaction
  when called from sudo or from a shell script. [Jay Bosamiya]
</li><li>  Improvements to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/whois-ip.html">whois-ip</a>.nse: fix an unhandled error when a referred-to
  response could not be understood; add a new pattern to recognise a
  LACNIC &quot;record not found&quot; type of response and update the way ARIN is
  queried. [jah]

<li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made numerous improvements to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-heartbleed.html">ssl-heartbleed</a> to provide

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a bug which caused this crash message:
<pre>
     IOError: [Errno socket error] [Errno 10060] A connection attempt failed
     because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of
     time, or established connection failed because connected host has
     failed to
     respond
</pre>  The bug was caused by us adding a DOCTYPE definition to Nmap&#39;s XML
  output which caused Python&#39;s XML parser to try and fetch the DTD
  every time it parses an XML file.  We now override that DTD-fetching
  behavior. [Daniel Miller]

<li>  Idle scan now supports IPv6. IPv6 packets don&#39;t usually come with
  fragments identifiers like IPv4 packets do, so new techniques had to
  be developed to make idle scan possible. The implementation is by
  Mathias Morbitzer, who made it the subject of his master&#39;s thesis.

  being shown when -v is specified. This aligns with similar output for other
  scan types. [Daniel Miller]

  cleanup of warnings from LLVM&#39;s AddressSanitizer.  [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Added support for socks5 and corresponding regression tests.
  [Marek Lukaszuk, Petr Stodulka]
</li><li>  Added TCP support to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/dns.html">dns.lua</a>. [John Bond]
</li><li>  Added safe fd_set operations. This makes nmap fail gracefully instead of
  crashing when the number of file descriptors grows over FD_SETSIZE. Jacek
  Wielemborek reported the crash. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/tls.html">tls</a> library for functions related to SSLv3 and TLS messages.

  updated to use this library. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Added NSE and Zenmap unit tests to &quot;make check&quot; [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Enable <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> to use the large Nikto fingerprint database at runtime
  if provided by the user. For licensing reasons, we do not distribute this
  database, but the integration effort has the blessing of the Nikto folks.
  [George Chatzisofroniou]
</li><li>  Updated bundled liblua from 5.2.2 to 5.2.3 (bugfix release) [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Added version detection signatures and probes for a bunch of Android
  remote mouse/keyboard servers, including AndroMouse, AirHID,
  Wifi-mouse, and RemoteMouse. [Paul Hemberger]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed compilation when --without-liblua is specified in
  configure (an #include needed an ifdef guard). [Quentin Glidic]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in libdnet with handling interfaces with AF_LINK addresses on
  FreeBSD &gt;9 reported by idwer on IRC. Likely affected other *BSDs. Handled by
  skipping these non-network addresses. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug with UDP checksum calculation. When the UDP checksum is zero
  (0x0000), it must be transmitted as 1&#39;s-complement -0 (0xffff) to avoid
  ambiguity with +0, which indicates no checksum was calculated. This affected
  UDP on IPv4 only. Reported by Michael Weber. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Removed a fixed value (28428) which was being set for the Request ID in
  the snmpWalk library function; a value based on nmap.clock_ms will now be set
  instead. [jah]
</li><li>  The ICMP ID of ICMP probes is now matched against the sent ICMP ID,
  to reduce the chance of false matches. Patch by Chris Johnson.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/telnet-brute.html">telnet-brute</a> support multiple parallel guessing threads,
  reuse connections, and support password-only logins. [nnposter]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made the table returned by ssh1.fetch_host_key contain a &quot;key&quot;
  element, like that of ssh2.fetch_host_key. This fixed a crash in the
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssh-hostkey.html">ssh-hostkey</a> script reported by Dan Farmer and Florian Pelgrim. The
  &quot;key&quot; element of ssh2.fetch_host_key now is base64-encoded, to match
  the format used by the known_hosts file. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Handle timers and timeouts via a priority queue (using a heap)
  for improved performance. Nsock now only iterates over events which are
  completed or expired instead of inspecting the entire event set at each
  iteration. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Update <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-cache-snoop.html">dns-cache-snoop</a> script to use a new list of top 50
  domains rather than a 2010 list. [Nicolle Neulist]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash that would happen when you entered a search
  term starting with a colon: &quot;AttributeError:
  &#39;FilteredNetworkInventory&#39; object has no attribute &#39;match_&#39;&quot;.
  Reported by Kris Paernell. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Added NCAT_PROTO, NCAT_REMOTE_ADDR, NCAT_REMOTE_PORT, NCAT_LOCAL_ADDR
  and NCAT_LOCAL_PORT environment variables being set in all --*-exec child
  processes.

<li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Added --lua-exec. This feature is basically the equivalent of &#39;ncat
  --sh-exec &quot;lua &lt;scriptname&gt;&quot;&#39; and allows you to run Lua scripts with Ncat,

</li><li>  Integrated all of your IPv4 OS fingerprint submissions since January
  (1,300 of them). Added 91 fingerprints, bringing the new total to 4,118.

  low on IPv6 fingerprints, so please scan any IPv6 systems you own or
  administer and submit them to <a href="https://nmap.org/submit">https://nmap.org/submit</a>/.  Both new
  fingerprints (if Nmap doesn&#39;t find a good match) and corrections (if Nmap
  guesses wrong) are useful. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Added initial proxy support to Nsock. Nmap version detection
  and NSE can now establish TCP connections through chains of one or
  more CONNECT or SOCKS4 proxies. Use the Nmap --proxies option with a
  chain of one or more proxies as the argument (example:
  <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>,socks4://someproxy.example.com). Note that
  only version detection and NSE are supported so far (no port
  scanning or host discovery), and there are other limitations
  described in the man page. [Henri Doreau]

</ul>
</li><li>  Updated the Nmap license agreement to close some loopholes and stop some
  abusers. It&#39;s particularly targeted at companies which distribute
  malware-laden Nmap installers as we caught Download.com doing last
  year--<a href="http://insecure.org/news/download-com-fiasco.html">http://insecure.org/news/download-com-fiasco.html</a> . The updated
  license is in the all the normal places, including
  <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/COPYING.">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/COPYING.</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span><span class="cltag">[SECURITY]</span> Oops, there was a vulnerability in one of our 437 NSE scripts.  If
  you ran the (fortunately non-default) <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-domino-enum-passwords.html">http-domino-enum-passwords</a> script
  with the (fortunately also non-default) domino-enum-passwords.idpath
  parameter against a malicious server, it could cause an arbitrarily named
  file to to be written to the client system. Thanks to Trustwave researcher
  Piotr Duszynski for discovering and reporting the problem.  We&#39;ve fixed
  that script, and also updated several other scripts to use a new
  stdnse.filename_escape function for extra safety. This breaks our record
  of never having a vulnerability in the 16 years that Nmap has existed, but
  that&#39;s still a fairly good run! [David, Fyodor]
</li><li>  Unicast CIDR-style IPv6 range scanning is now supported, so you can
  specify targets such as en.wikipedia.org/120.  Obviously it will take ages
  if you specify a huge space.  For example, a /64 contains
  18,446,744,073,709,551,616 addresses. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  It&#39;s now possible to mix IPv4 range notation with CIDR netmasks in target
  specifications. For example, 192.168-170.4-100,200.5/16 is effectively the
  same as 192.168.168-170.0-255.0-255. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Timeout script-args are now standardized to use the timespec that Nmap&#39;s
  command-line arguments take (5s, 5000ms, 1h, etc.). Some scripts that
  previously took an integer number of milliseconds will now treat that as a
  number of seconds if not explicitly denoted as ms. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Nmap may now partially rearrange its target list for more efficient
  host groups. Previously, a single target with a different interface,
  or with an IP address the same as a that of a target already in the
  group, would cause the group to be broken off at whatever size it
  was. Now, we buffer a small number of such targets, and keep looking
  through the input for more targets to fill out the current group.
  [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The -i option (idle timeout) now works in listen mode as well as
  connect mode. [Tomas Hozza]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Ncat now support chained certificates with the --<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a>
  option. [Greg Bailey]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Nping now checks for a matching ICMP ID on echo replies, to avoid
  receiving crosstalk from other ping programs running at the same
  time. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The ipOps.isPrivate library now considers the deprecated site-local
  prefix fec0::/10 to be private. [Marek Majkowski]
</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s routing table is now sorted first by netmask, then by metric.
  Previously it was the other way around, which could cause a very general
  route with a low metric to be preferred over a specific route with a
  higher metric.
</li><li>  Routes are now sorted to prefer those with a lower metric. Retrieval of
  metrics is supported only on Linux and Windows. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Fixed a byte-ordering problem on little-endian architectures when doing
  idle scan with a zombie that uses broken ID increments.  [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Stop parsing TCP options after reaching EOL in libnetutil. Bug reported by
  Gustavo Moreira. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-ip6-arpa-scan.html">dns-ip6-arpa-scan</a> script now optionally accepts &quot;/&quot; syntax for a
  network mask. Based on a patch by Indula Nayanamith.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Reduced the default --max-conns limit from 100 to 60 on Windows, to
  stay within platform limitations. Suggested by Andrey Olkhin.
</li><li>  Fixed IPv6 routing table alignment on NetBSD.
</li><li>  Fixed our NSEDoc system so the author field uses UTF-8 and we can spell
  people&#39;s name properly, even if they use crazy non-ASCII characters like
  Marin Mar&#x17E;i&#x107;.  [David Fifield]
</li><li>  UDP protocol payloads were added for detecting the Murmer service (a
  server for the Mumble voice communication client) and TeamSpeak 2 VoIP
  software.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-phpmyadmin-dir-traversal.html">http-phpmyadmin-dir-traversal</a> by Alexey Meshcheryakov.
</li><li>  Updated libdnet to not SIOCIFNETMASK before SIOCIFADDR on OpenBSD. This
  was reported to break on -current as of May 2013. [Giovanni Bechis]
</li><li>  Fixed address matching for SCTP (-PY) ping. [Marin Mar&#x17E;i&#x107;]
</li><li>  Removed some non-ANSI-C strftime format strings (&quot;%F&quot;) and
  locale-dependent formats (&quot;%c&quot;) from NSE scripts and libraries.
  C99-specified %F was noticed by Alex Weber. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Improved internationalization support:
<ul><li>Added Polish translation by Jacek Wielemborek.
</li><li>Updated the Italian translation. [Giacomo]</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed internationalization files. Running in a language other
  than the default English would result in the error &quot;ValueError: too many
  values to unpack&quot;. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Updated the included Liblua from version 5.2.1 to 5.2.2. [Patrick
  Donnelly]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Added a minimal regression test suite for Nsock. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Updated the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/redis-brute.html">redis-brute</a> and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/redis-info.html">redis-info</a> scripts to work against the
  latest versions of redis server. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed errors in connecting to IPv6 proxies. [Joachim Henke]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Updated <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/hostmap-bfk.html">hostmap-bfk</a> to work with the latest version of their website
  (bfk.de). [Paulino Calderon]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added XML structured output support to:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/xmpp-info.html">xmpp-info</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/irc-info.html">irc-info</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/sslv2.html">sslv2</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/address-info.html">address-info</a> [Daniel Miller]

</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-git.html">http-git</a>.nse. [Alex Weber]</li></ul>

</li><li>  Added new service probes for:
<ul><li>Erlang distribution nodes [Michael Schierl]
</li><li>Minecraft servers. [Eric Davisson]
</li><li>Hazelcast data grid. [Pavel Kankovsky]</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Rewrote <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/telnet-brute.html">telnet-brute</a> for better compatibility with a variety of
  telnet servers. [nnposter]
</li><li>  Fixed a regression that changed the number of delimiters in machine
  output. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Fixed a regression in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-dropbox-listener.html">broadcast-dropbox-listener</a> which prevented it from
  producing output. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Handle ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) responses to port scan probes.  Ports
  will be reported as &quot;filtered&quot;, to be consistent with existing Connect
  scan results, and will have a reason of time-exceeded.  DiabloHorn
  reported this issue via IRC. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Add new decoders (BROWSER, DHCP6 and LLMNR) to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-listener.html">broadcast-listener</a> and
  changed output of some of the decoders slightly. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  The list of name servers on Windows now ignores those from inactive
  interfaces. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Namespace the pipes used to communicate with subprocesses by PID, to avoid
  multiple instances of Ncat from interfering with each other.  Patch by
  Andrey Olkhin.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Changed <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ip-geolocation-geoplugin.html">ip-geolocation-geoplugin</a> to use the web service&#39;s new output
  format. Reported by Robin Wood.
</li><li>  Limited the number of open sockets in ultra_scan to FD_SETSIZE. Very fast
  connect scans could write past the end of an fd_set and cause a variety of
  crashes:
<pre>
    nmap: scan_engine.cc:978: bool ConnectScanInfo::clearSD(int): Assertion `numSDs &gt; 0&#39; failed.
    select failed in do_one_select_round(): Bad file descriptor (9)
</pre>  [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that prevented Nmap from finding any interfaces when one of
  them had the type ARP_HDR_APPLETALK; this was the case for AppleTalk
  interfaces. However, This support is not complete since AppleTalk
  interfaces use different size hardware addresses than Ethernet.  Nmap IP
  level scans should work without any problem, please refer to the
  &#39;--send-ip&#39; switch and to the following thread:
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q1/214">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q1/214</a>.  This bug was reported by Steven
  Gregory Johnson. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Nping on Windows now skips localhost targets for privileged pings
  on (with an error message) because those generally don&#39;t work.  [David
  Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Ncat now keeps running in connect mode after receiving EOF from the
  remote socket, unless --recv-only is in effect.  [Tomas Hozza]
</li><li>  Packet trace of ICMP packets now include the ICMP ID and sequence number
  by default. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed various NSEDoc bugs found by David Matousek.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Zenmap now understands the NMAP_PRIVILEGED and NMAP_UNPRIVILEGED
  environment variables. [Tyler Wagner]
</li><li>  Added an ncat_assert macro.  This is similar to assert(), but remains even
  if NDEBUG is defined. Replaced all Ncat asserts with this. We also moved
  operation with side effects outside of asserts as yet another layer of
  bug-prevention [David Fifield].
</li><li>  Added nmap-fo.xsl, contributed by Tilik Ammon. This converts Nmap XML into
  XSL-FO, which can be converted into PDF using tools suck as Apache FOP.
</li><li>  Increased the number of slack file descriptors not used during connect
  scan. Previously, the calculation did not consider the descriptors used by
  various open log files. Connect scans using a lot of sockets could fail
  with the message &quot;Socket creation in sendConnectScanProbe: Too many open
  files&quot;. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Changed the --webxml XSL stylesheet to point to the new location of
  nmap.xsl in the new repository (<a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.xsl">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.xsl</a>).
  It still may not work in web browsers due to same origin policy (see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q1/58">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q1/58</a>). [David Fifield, Simon John]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The vulnerability library can now preserve vulnerability information
  across multiple ports of the same host. The bug was reported by
  iphelix. [Djalal Harouni]
</li><li>  Removed the undocumented -q option, which renamed the nmap process to
  something like &quot;pine&quot;.
</li><li>  Moved the Japanese man page from man1/jp to man1/ja. JP is a country code
  while JA is a language code. Reported by Christian Neukirchen.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Reworked the logging infrastructure to make it more flexible and
  consistent. Updated Nmap, Nping and Ncat accordingly. Nsock log level can
  now be adjusted at runtime by pressing d/D in nmap.  [Henri Doreau, David
  Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed scripts using unconnected UDP sockets. The bug was reported by
  Dhiru Kholia at <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q4/422">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q4/422</a>. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Made some changes to Ndiff to reduce parsing time when dealing with large
  Nmap XML output files. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  Clean up the source code a bit to resolve some false positive issues
  identified by the Parfait static code analysis program. Oracle apparently
  runs this on programs (including Nmap) that they ship with Solaris.  See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q4/504">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q4/504</a>. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash that could be caused by opening the About dialog,
  using the window manager to close it, and opening it again.  This was
  reported by Yashartha Chaturvedi and Jordan Schroeder.  [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Made test-addrset.sh exit with nonzero status if any tests
  fail. This in turn causes &quot;make check&quot; to fail if any tests fail.
  [Andreas Stieger]
</li><li>  Fixed compilation with --without-liblua. The bug was reported by Rick
  Farina, Nikos Chantziaras, and Alex Turbov. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Fixed CRC32c calculation (as used in SCTP scans) on 64-bit
  platforms. [Pontus Andersson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added multicast group name output to
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-igmp-discovery.html">broadcast-igmp-discovery</a>.nse. [Vasily Kulikov]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added new fingerprints for <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a>: Sitecore, Moodle, typo3,
  SquirrelMail, RoundCube. [Jesper K&uuml;ckelhahn]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 6.25 [2012-11-29] <a class="versionlink" id="6.25" href="#6.25" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added CPE to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html">smb-os-discovery</a> output.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed the printing of warning messages for large arguments to
  the -i and -w options. [Michal Hlavinka]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Shut down the write part of connected sockets in listen mode
  when stdin hits EOF, just as was already done in connect mode.
  [Michal Hlavinka]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Removed a crashing error that could happen when canceling a
  &quot;Print to File&quot; on Windows:
<pre>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;zenmapGUI\MainWindow.pyo&quot;, line 831, in _print_cb

    GError: Error from StartDoc
</pre>  This bug was reported by Imre Ad&aacute;csi. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Added some new checks for failed library calls. [Bill Parker]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 6.20BETA1 [2012-11-16] <a class="versionlink" id="6.20BETA1" href="#6.20BETA1" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Integrated all of your IPv4 OS fingerprint submissions since January
  (more than 3,000 of them).  Added 373 fingerprints, bringing the new
  total to 3,946.  Additions include Linux 3.6, Windows 8, Windows
  Server 2012, Mac OS X 10.8, and a ton of new WAPs, printers,
  routers, and other devices--including our first IP-enabled doorbell!
  Many existing fingerprints were improved. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Integrated all of your service/version detection fingerprints
  submitted since January (more than 1,500)!  Our signature
  count jumped by more than 400 to 8,645.  We now detect 897
  protocols, from extremely popular ones like http, ssh, smtp and imap
  to the more obscure airdroid, gopher-proxy, and
  enemyterritory. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Integrated your latest IPv6 OS submissions and corrections. We&#39;re
  still low on IPv6 fingerprints, so please scan any IPv6 systems you
  own or administer and submit them to <a href="https://nmap.org/submit">https://nmap.org/submit</a>/.  Both
  new fingerprints (if Nmap doesn&#39;t find a good match) and corrections
  (if Nmap guesses wrong) are useful.
</li><li>  Enabled support for IPv6 traceroute using UDP, SCTP, and IPProto
  (Next Header) probes.  Previously, only TCP and ICMP were
  supported.  [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Scripts can now return a structured name-value table so that results
  are query-able from XML output. Scripts can return a string as
  before, or a table, or a table and a string. In this last case, the
  table will go to XML output and the string will go to screen output.
  See <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html#nse-structured-output">https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html#nse-structured-output</a> [Daniel
  Miller, David Fifield, Patrick Donnelly]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Added new poll and kqueue I/O engines for improved
  performance on Windows and BSD-based systems including Mac OS X.
  These are in addition to the epoll engine (used on Linux) and the
  classic select engine fallback for other system.  [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Added support for Unix domain sockets. The new -U and
  --unixsock options activate this mode.  These provide compatibility
  with Hobbit&#39;s original Netcat. [Tomas Hozza]
</li><li>  Moved some Windows dependencies, including OpenSSL, libsvn, and the
  vcredist files, into a new public Subversion directory
  /nmap-mswin32-aux and moved it out of the source tarball. This
  reduces the compressed tarball size from 22 MB to 8 MB and similarly
  reduces the bandwidth and storage required for an svn checkout.
  Folks who build Nmap on Windows will need to check out
  /nmap-mswin32-aux along with /nmap as described at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html#inst-win-source.">https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html#inst-win-source.</a>
</li><li>  Many of the great features in this release were created by college
  and grad students generously sponsored by Google&#39;s Summer of Code
  program.  Thanks, Google Open Source Department!  This year&#39;s team
  of five developers is introduced at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q2/204">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q2/204</a> and their successes
  documented at <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q4/138">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q4/138</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Replaced old RPC grinder (RPC enumeration, performed as part
  of version detection when a port seems to run a SunRPC service) with
  a faster and easier to maintain NSE-based implementation.  This also
  allowed us to remove the crufty old pos_scan scan engine. [Hani
  Benhabiles]
</li><li>  Updated our Nmap Scripting Engine to use Lua 5.2 (and then 5.2.1)
  rather than 5.1. See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q2/34">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q2/34</a> for
  details. [Patrick Donnelly]

</li><li>  Added Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifiers to nearly 1,000
  more OS detection signatures.  Nmap 6.01 had them for 2,608 of 3,572
  fingerprints (73%) and now we have them for 3,558 out of 3,946
  (90%). [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Scans that use OS sockets (including TCP connect scan, version
  detection, and script scan) now use the SO_BINDTODEVICE sockopt on
  Linux, so that the -e (select network device) option is
  honored. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Host filters can now do negative matching, for example you
  can use &quot;os:!linux&quot; to match hosts NOT detected as Linux. [Daniel
  Miller]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that caused an incorrect source address to be set when
  scanning certain addresses (apparently those ending in .0) on
  Windows XP. The symptom of this bug was the messages
<pre>
    get_srcaddr: can&#39;t connect socket: The requested address is not valid in its context.
    Failed to convert source address to presentation format!?!  Error: Unknown error
</pre>  Thanks to Robert Washam and Jorge Hernandez for reports and help
  debugging. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Upgraded the included OpenSSL to version 1.0.1c. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added changes to brute and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html">unpwdb</a> libraries to allow more
  flexible iterator specification and control. [Aleksandar Nikolic]
</li><li>  Tested that our WinPcap installer works on Windows 8 and Windows
  Server 2012 build 8400.  Updated to installer text to recommend that
  users select the option to start &#39;NPF&#39; at startup. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  Changed libdnet&#39;s routing interface to return an interface name for
  each route on the most common operating systems. This is used to
  improve the quality of Nmap&#39;s matching of routes to interfaces,
  which was previously done by matching routes to interface addresses.
  [Djalal Harouni, David Fifield]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that prevented Nmap from finding any interfaces when one
  of them had the type ARPHDR_INFINIBAND; this was the case for
  IP-over-InfiniBand interfaces. However, This support is not complete
  since IPoIB interfaces use 20 bytes for the hardware address, and
  currently we only report and handle 6 bytes.
  Nmap IP level scans should work without any problem, please refer to
  the &#39;--send-ip&#39; switch and to the following thread:
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q3/642">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q3/642</a>
  This bug was reported by starlight.2012q3. [Djalal Harouni]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that prevented Nmap from finding any interfaces when one
  of them had the type ARPHDR_IEEE80211; this was the case for wireless
  interfaces operating in access point mode. This bug was reported by
  Sebastiaan Vileijn. [Djalal Harouni]
</li><li>  Updated the Zenmap desktop icons on Windows, Linux, and Mac with higher
  resolution ones. [Sean Rivera, David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Script results for a host or service are now sorted
  alphabetically by script name. [Sean Rivera]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that prevented Nmap from finding any interfaces when any
  interface had the type ARPHRD_VOID; this was the case for OpenVZ
  venet interfaces. [Djalal Harouni, David Fifield]
</li><li>  Linux unreachable routes are now properly ignored. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Added Dan Miller as an Nmap committer.  He has done a ton of great
  work on Nmap, as you can see by searching for him in this CHANGELOG
  or reading the Nmap committers list at
  <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/committers.txt">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/committers.txt</a> .
</li><li>  Added a new --disable-arp-ping option. This option prevents Nmap
  from implicitly using ARP or ND host discovery for discovering
  directly connected Ethernet targets. This is useful in networks
  using proxy ARP, which make all addresses appear to be up using ARP
  scan. The previously recommended workaround for this situation,
  --send-ip, didn&#39;t work on Windows because that lame excuse for an
  operating system is still missing raw socket support.  [David
  Fifield (editorializing added by Fyodor)]
</li><li>  Protocol scan (-sO) probes for TCP, UDP, and SCTP now go to ports
  80, 40125, and 80 respectively, instead of being randomly generated
  or going to the same port as the source port. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  The Nmap --log-errors functionality (including errors and warnings
  in the normal-format output file) is now always true, whether you
  pass that option or not. [Sean Rivera]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Rewrote <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-brute.html">ftp-brute</a> script to use the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/brute.html">brute</a> library for
  performing password auditing. [Aleksandar Nikolic]
</li><li>  Reduced the size of Port structures by about two thirds (from 176 to
  64 bytes on x86_64). They had accidentally grown during the IPv6
  code merge. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Made source port numbers (used to encode probe metadata) increment
  so as not to overlap between different scanning phases. Previously
  it was possible for an RST response to an ACK probe from host
  discovery to be misinterpreted as a reply to a SYN probe from port
  scanning. [Sean Rivera, David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added support for ECDSA keys to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssh-hostkey.html">ssh-hostkey</a>.nse. [Adam &Scaron;tevko]
</li><li>  Changed the CPE for Linux from cpe:/o:linux:kernel to
  cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel to reflect deprecation in the official CPE
  dictionary.
</li><li>  Added some additional CPE entries to nmap-service-probes.
  [Dillon Graham]
</li><li>  Fixed an assertion failure with IPv6 traceroute trying to use an
  unsupported protocol:
<pre>
    nmap: traceroute.cc:749: virtual unsigned char*
    UDPProbe::build_packet(const sockaddr_storage*, u32*) const: Assertion
    `source-&gt;ss_family == 2&#39; failed.
</pre>  This was reported by Pierre Emeriaud. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Added version detection signatures for half a dozen new or changed
  products. [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  Fixed protocol number-to-name mapping. A patch was contributed by
  hejianet.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The nmap.ip_send function now takes a second argument, the
  destination to send to. Previously the destination address was taken
  from the packet buffer, but this failed for IPv6 link-local
  addresses, because the scope ID is not part of the packet. Calling
  ip_send without a destination address will continue to use the old
  behavior, but this practice is deprecated.
</li><li>  Increased portability of configure scripts on systems using a libc
  other than Glibc. Several problems were reported by John Spencer.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpc-grind.html">rpc-grind</a>.nse that would cause unresponsive UDP
  ports to be wrongly marked open. This was reported by Christopher
  Clements. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Close connection endpoint when receiving EOF on
  stdin. [Michal Hlavinka].
</li><li>  Fixed interface listing on NetBSD. The bug was first noticed by
  Fredrik Pettai and diagnosed by Jan Schaumann. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Applied a blocking-socket workaround for a bug that could
  prevent some sends from working in listen mode. The problem was
  reported by Jonas Wielicki. [Alex Weber, David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Updated <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/mssql.html">mssql.lua</a> library to support additional data types,
  enhanced some of the existing data types, added the DoneProc
  response token, and reordered code for maintainability. [Tom
  Sellers]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Nping now prints out an error and exists when the user tries to use
  the -p flag for a scan option where that is meaningless. [Sean Rivera]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added spoolss functions and constants to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/msrpc.html">msrpc.lua</a>. [Aleksandar Nikolic]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Reduced the number of names tried by <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-vhosts.html">http-vhosts</a> by default.
  [Vlatko Kosturjak]

  is invoked.  This is necessary to avoid &quot;Too many open files&quot; errors if
  RPC grind creates an excessive number of sockets.  We should have a
  cleaner general solution for this, and not require scripts to &quot;connect&quot;
  their unconnected UDP sockets.  But there may be a good reason for
  enforcing socket locking only on connect, not on creation. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/lltd-discovery.html">lltd-discovery</a> scripts now parses for hostnames and outputs network
  card manufacturer. [Hani Benhabiles]
</li><li>  Added protocol specific payloads for IPv6 hop-by-hop (0x00), routing (0x2b),
  fragment (0x2c), and destination (0x3c). [Sean Rivera]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added support for decoding OSPF Hello packets to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-listener.html">broadcast-listener</a>.
  [Hani Benhabiles]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a false positive in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-vuln-cve2011-3192.html">http-vuln-cve2011-3192</a>.nse, which detected
  Apache 2.2.22 as vulnerable. [Michael Meyer]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Modified multiple scripts that operated against HTTP based services
  so as to remove false positives that were generated when the target service
  answers with a 200 response to all requests. [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSOCK]</span> Fixed an epoll-engine-specific bug. The engine didn&#39;t recognized FDs
  that were internally closed and replaced by other ones. This happened during
  reconnect attempts. Also, the IOD flags were not properly cleared.
  [Henri Doreau, Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Added support for log type bitmasks in log_vwrite(). Also replaced a fatal()
  statement by an assert(0) to get rid of a possible infinite call loop when
  passed an invalid log type. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  Added handling for the unexpected error WSAENETRESET (10052). This error is
  currently wrapped in the ifdef for WIN32 as there error appears to be unique
  to windows [Sean Rivera]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added default values for Expires, Call-ID, Allow and Content-Length
  headers in SIP requests and removed redundant code in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/sip.html">sip</a> library.
  [Hani Benhabiles]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Calling methods of unconnected sockets now causes the usual
  error code return value, instead of raising a Lua error. The problem
  was noticed by Daniel Miller. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added AUTH_UNIX support to the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/rpc.html">rpc</a> library and NFS scripts.
  [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash in the profile editor that would happen when
  the nmap binary couldn&#39;t be found. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Made the various Makefiles&#39; treatment of makefile.dep uniform:
  &quot;make clean&quot; keeps the file and &quot;make distclean&quot; deletes it.
  [Michael McTernan]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed dozens of scripts and libraries to work better on
  system which don&#39;t have OpenSSL available. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> --output logging now works in UDP mode. Thanks to Michal
  Hlavinka for reporting the bug. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> More Windows 7 and Windows 2008 fixes for the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/smb.html">smb</a> library and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-ls.html">smb-ls</a>
  scripts. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added SPNEGO authentication supporting Windows 7 and Windows 2008 to
  the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/smb.html">smb</a> library. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Changed <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-brute.html">http-brute</a> so that it works against the root path
  (&quot;/&quot;) by default rather than always requiring the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-brute.html">http-brute</a>.path
  script argument. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Applied patch from Daniel Miller that fixes bug in several scripts and

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added Italian translation by Francesco Tombolini and
  Japanese translation by Yujiy Tounai.  Some typos in the Japanese
  translation were corrected by OKANO Takayoshi.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Rewrote <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-brute.html">mysql-brute</a> to use <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/brute.html">brute</a> library [Aleksandar Nikolic]
</li><li>  Improved the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/mysql.html">mysql</a> library to handle multiple columns with the same name,
  added a formatResultset function to format a query response to a table
  suitable for script output. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  The message &quot;nexthost: failed to determine route to ...&quot; is now a
  warning rather than a fatal error. Addresses that are skipped in
  this way are recorded in the XML output as &quot;target&quot; elements. [David
  Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-sniffer.html">targets-sniffer</a> now is capable of sniffing IPv6 addresses.
  [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Ported the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pop3-brute.html">pop3-brute</a> script to use the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/brute.html">brute</a> library.
  [Piotr Olma]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added an error message indicating script failure, when Nmap is being
  run in non verbose/debug mode. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  Service-scan information is now included in XML and grepable output
  even if -sV wasn&#39;t used. This information can be set by scripts in the

</pre>  [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that caused Nmap to fail to find any network interface when
  at least one of them is in the monitor mode. The fix was to define the
  ARP_HRD_IEEE80211_RADIOTAP 802.11 radiotap header identifier in the
  libdnet-stripped code. Network interfaces that are in this mode are used
  by radiotap for 802.11 frame injection and reception. The bug was
  reported by Tom Eichstaedt and Henri Doreau.

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Updated the version of Python used to build the Windows

</li><li>  In XML output, &quot;osclass&quot; elements are now child elements of the
  &quot;osmatch&quot; they belong to. Old output was thus:
<pre>
    &lt;os&gt;&lt;osclass/&gt;&lt;osclass/&gt;...&lt;osmatch/&gt;&lt;osmatch/&gt;...&lt;/os&gt;

  you use an Nmap XML parser that doesn&#39;t understand the new
  structure. The xmloutputversion has been increased to 1.04.
</li><li>  Added a new &quot;target&quot; element to XML output that indicates when a
  target specification was ignored, perhaps because of a syntax error
  or DNS failure. It looks like this:
<pre>
    &lt;target specification=&quot;1.2.3.4.5&quot; status=&quot;skipped&quot; reason=&quot;invalid&quot;/&gt;
</pre>  [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/samba-vuln-cve-2012-1182.html">samba-vuln-cve-2012-1182</a> which detects the
  SAMBA pre-auth remote root vulnerability (CVE-2012-1182).

  installations with a remote code execution vulnerability. [Paulino
  Calderon]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added script targets-ipv6-mld that sends a malformed ICMP6 MLD Query
  to discover IPv6 enabled hosts on the LAN. [Niteesh Kumar]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rdp-vuln-ms12-020.html">rdp-vuln-ms12-020</a>.nse by Aleksandar Nikolic. This tests
  for two Remote Desktop vulnerabilities, including one allowing

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/stun.html">stun</a> library and the scripts <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/stun-version.html">stun-version</a> and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/stun-info.html">stun-info</a>, which

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/duplicates.html">duplicates</a> which attempts to determine duplicate
  hosts by analyzing information collected by other scripts. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  Fixed the routing table loop on OS X so that on-link routes appear.
  Previously, they were ignored so that things like ARP scan didn&#39;t
  work. [Patrik Karlsson, David Fifield]
</li><li>  Upgraded included libpcap to version 1.2.1.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added ciphers from RFC 5932 and Fortezza-based ciphers to
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html">ssl-enum-ciphers</a>.nse. The patch was submitted by Darren McDonald.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Renamed hostmap.nse to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/hostmap-bfk.html">hostmap-bfk</a>.nse.
</li><li>  Fixed a compilation problem on Solaris 9 caused by a missing
  definition of IPV6_V6ONLY. Reported by Dagobert Michelsen.
</li><li>  Setting --min-parallelism by itself no longer forces the maximum
  parallelism to the same value. [Chris Woodbury, David Fifield]
</li><li>  Changed XML output to show the &quot;service&quot; element whenever a tunnel
  is discovered for a port, even if the service behind it was unknown.
  [Matt Foster]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash that would happen in the profile editor when
  the script.db file doesn&#39;t exist. The bug was reported by Daniel

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> It is now possible to compare scans having the same name or
  command line parameters. [Jah, David Fifield]
</li><li>  Fixed an error that could occur with ICMPv6 probes and -d4 debugging:
  &quot;Unexpected probespec2ascii type encountered&quot; [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added new script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-chrono.html">http-chrono</a>, which measures min, max and average
  response times of web servers. [Ange Gutek]
</li><li>  Applied a workaround to make pcap captures work better on Solaris
  10. This involves peeking at the pcap buffer to ensure that captures
  are not being lost. A symptom of the previous behavior was that,
  when doing ARP host discovery against two targets, only one would be
  reported as up. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that could cause Nsock timers to fire too early. This
  could happen for the timed probes in IPv6 OS detection, causing an
  incorrect measurement of the TCP_ISR feature. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> We now build on Windows with a newer version of PyGTK, so
  copy and paste should work again.

  In rare cases a certain interleaving of probes and responses would
  result in an assertion failure.

<li>  Integrated all of your IPv4 OS fingerprint submissions since June
  2011 (about 1,900 of them).  Added about 256 new fingerprints (and
  deleted some bogus ones), bringing the new total to 3,572.
  Additions include Apple iOS 5.01, OpenBSD 4.9 and 5.0, FreeBSD 7.0
  through 9.0-PRERELEASE, and a ton of new WAPs, routers, and other
  devices. Many existing fingerprints were improved. For more details,

  submitted since November 2010--more than 2,500 of them!  Our
  signature count increased more than 10% to 7,423 covering 862
  protocols. Some amusing and bizarre new services are described at

</li><li>  Integrated your latest IPv6 OS submissions and corrections. We&#39;re
  still low on IPv6 fingerprints, so please scan any IPv6 systems you
  own or administer and submit them to <a href="https://nmap.org/submit">https://nmap.org/submit</a>/.  Both
  new fingerprints (if Nmap doesn&#39;t find a good match) and corrections
  (if Nmap guesses wrong) are useful.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a host-based registry which only persists (for the given
  host) until all scripts have finished scanning that host. The normal
  registry saves information until it is deleted or the Nmap scan
  ends. That is a waste of memory for information which doesn&#39;t need

</li><li>  IPv6 OS detection now includes a novelty detection system which
  avoids printing a match when an observed fingerprint is too
  different from fingerprints seen before. As the OS database is still
  small, this helps to avoid making (essentially) wild guesses when
  seeing a new operating system. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Refactored the nsock library to add the nsock-engines system. This
  allows system-specific scalable IO notification facilities to be
  used while maintaining the portable Nsock API. This initial version
  comes with an epoll-based engine for Linux and a select-based
  fallback engine for all other operating systems. Also added the
  --nsock-engine option to Nmap, Nping and Ncat to enforce use of a
  specific Nsock IO engine. [Henri Doreau]

</li><li>  CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) OS classification is now supported
  for IPv6 OS detection. Previously it was only available for
  IPv4. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The host.os table is now a structured array of table that
  include OS class information and CPE. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html">https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html</a> for documentation of the new
  structure. [Henri Doreau, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Service matches can now access CPE through the
  port.version.cpe array. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  Added a new --script-args-file option which allows you to specify
  the name of a file containing all of your desired NSE script
  arguments. The arguments may be separated with commas or newlines
  and may be overridden by arguments specified on the command-line
  with --script-args. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Audited the nmap-service-probes database to remove all unused
  captures, fixing dozens of bugs with captures either being ignored
  or two fields erroneously using the same capture. [Lauri Kokkonen,
  David Fifield, and Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  Added new version detection probes and match lines for:
<ul><li>Erlang Port Mapper Daemon
</li><li>Couchbase Membase NoSQL database
</li><li>Basho Riak distributed database protocol buffers client (PBC)
</li><li>Tarantool in-memory data store</li></ul>
  [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  Split the nmap-update client into its own binary RPM to avoid the
  Nmap RPM having a dependency on the Subversion and APR libraries.
  We&#39;re not yet distributing this binary nmap-update RPM since the
  system isn&#39;t complete, but the source code is available in the Nmap
  tarball and source RPM. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added authentication support to the MongoDB library and
  modified existing scripts to support it. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added support to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-listener.html">broadcast-listener</a> for extracting address, native VLAN
  and management IP address from CDP packets. [Tom Sellers]

  SSL certificates in the registry.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Patch our <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/bitcoin.html">bitcoin</a> library to support recent changes in the
  BitCoin protocol. [Andrew Orr, Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  Fixed an error where very long messages could cause an
  assertion failure: &quot;log_vwrite: vsnprintf failed.  Even after
  increasing bufferlen to ---, Vsnprintf returned -1 (logt == 1).&quot;
  This was reported by David Hingos.
</li><li>  Fixed an assertion failure that was printed when a fatal error
  occurred while an XML tag was incomplete: &quot;!xml.tag_open, file
  ..\xml.cc, line 401&quot;. This was reported by David Hingos. [David
  Fifield]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added support for decoding EIGRP broadcasts from Cisco routers
  to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-listener.html">broadcast-listener</a>. [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added redirect support to the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http</a> library. All calls to
  http.get and http.head now transparently handle any HTTP
  redirects. The number and destination of redirects are limited by
  default to avoid endless loops or unwanted follows of redirects to
  different servers, but they can be configured. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Modified the sql-injection script to use the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/httpspider.html">httpspider</a> library.

  SSL server:
  nsock_core.c:186: update_events: Assertion `(ev_inc &amp; ev_dec) == 0&#39; failed.
  Thanks to Ron for reporting the bug and testing. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added support to the DNS library for the CHAOS class and NSID
  requests. [John Bond]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Changed the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/dnsbl.html">dnsbl</a> library to take a much faster threaded
  approach to querying DNS blacklists. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added new services and the ATTACK category to the dnsbl
  script. [Duarte Silva]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a memory leak in PortList::setServiceProbeResults()
  which was noticed and reported by David Fifield. The leak was
  triggered by set_port_version calls from NSE.  [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a race condition in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-dhcp-discover.html">broadcast-dhcp-discover</a>.nse that
  could cause responses to be missed on fast networks. It was noticed
  by Vasiliy Kulikov. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in reverse name resolution: a name of &quot;.&quot; would leave
  the hostname unintialized and cause &quot;Illegal character(s) in
  hostname&quot; warnings. [Gisle Vanem]
</li><li>  Allow overriding the AR variable to use a different version of the
  ar library creation tool when creating the liblinear library. [Nuno
  Gon&ccedil;alves]
</li><li>  Added vcredist2008_x86.exe to the Windows zip file. This installer
  from MS must be run on new Windows 2008 systems (those which don&#39;t
  already have it) before running Nmap.  The Nmap Windows installer
  already takes care of this. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Removed about 5MB of unnecessary DocBook XSL from the Nping docs
  directory. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/packet.html">packet</a> library now uses consistent naming of the address fields
  for IPv4 and IPv6 packets (ip_bin_src, ip_bin_dst, ip_src, and
  ip_dst). [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  Update to the latest MAC address prefix assignments from IEEE as of
  March 8, 2012. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Fixed a problem in the ippackethdrinfo function which was leading to
  warning messages like: &quot;BOGUS!  Can&#39;t parse supposed IP packet&quot; during
  certain IPv6 scans. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Fixed building on Arch Linux. The PCAP_IS_SUITABLE test had to be
  modified to ensure that -lnl was passed on the build line. See the
  r28202 svn log for further information. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Include net/if.h before net/if_arp.h in netutil.cc and tcpip.cc to
  hopefully fix some build problems on AIX 5.3.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added IPv6 support to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/firewalk.html">firewalk</a>.nse. [Henri Doreau]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 5.61TEST4 [2012-01-02] <a class="versionlink" id="5.61TEST4" href="#5.61TEST4" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/httpspider.html">httpspider</a> library which is used for recursively
  crawling web sites for information.  New scripts using this
  functionality include <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-backup-finder.html">http-backup-finder</a>, http-email-harvest,
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-grep.html">http-grep</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-open-redirect.html">http-open-redirect</a>, and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-unsafe-output-escaping.html">http-unsafe-output-escaping</a>. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc">https://nmap.org/nsedoc</a>/ or the list later in this file for details
  on these. [Patrik]
</li><li>  Our Mac OS X packages are now x86-only (rather than universal),
  reducing the download size from 30 MB to about 17.  If you still
  need a PowerPC version (Apple stopped selling those machines in
  2006), you can use Nmap 5.51 or 5.61TEST2 from
  <a href="https://nmap.org/dist/?C">https://nmap.org/dist/?C</a>=M&amp;O=D.
</li><li>  We set up a new SVN server for the Nmap codebase.  This one uses SSL
  for better security, WebDAV rather than svnserve for greater
  functionality, is hosted on a faster (virtual) machine, provides
  Nmap code history back to 1998 rather than 2005, and removes the
  need for the special &quot;guest&quot; username.  The new server is at
  <a href="https://svn.nmap.org">https://svn.nmap.org</a>.  More information:
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q4/504.">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q4/504.</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a vulnerability management library (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/vulns.html">vulns.lua</a>) to store and to
  report discovered vulnerabilities.  Modified these scripts to use
  the new library:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-libopie.html">ftp-libopie</a>.nse

  [Djalal, Henri]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new script force feature.  You can force scripts to
  run against target ports (even if the &quot;wrong&quot; service is detected)
  by placing a plus in front of the script name passed to --script.

<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/telnet-encryption.html">telnet-encryption</a> determines whether the encryption option is
    supported on a remote telnet server.  Some systems (including
    FreeBSD and the krb5 telnetd available in many Linux

</li><li>  Nmap now includes a nmap-update program for obtaining the latest
  updates (new scripts, OS fingerprints, etc.)  The system is
  currently only available to a few developers for testing, but we
  hope to enable a larger set of beta testers soon. [David]
</li><li>  On Windows, the directory [HOME]\AppData\Roaming\nmap is now
  searched for data files. This is the equivalent of $HOME/.nmap on
  POSIX. [David]
</li><li>  Improved OS detection performance by scaling congestion control
  increments by the response rate during OS scan, just as was done
  for port scan before. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The targets-ipv6-multicast-*.nse scripts now scan all
  interfaces by default. They show the MAC address and interface name
  now too. [David, Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Added some new version detection probes:
<ul><li>MongoDB service [Martin Holst Swende]
</li><li>Metasploit XMLRPC service [Vlatko Kosturjak]
</li><li>Vuze filesharing system [Patrik]
</li><li>Redis key-value store [Patrik]

</li><li>TCP Kerberos [Patrik]
</li><li>PC-Duo [Patrik]
</li><li>PC Anywhere [Patrik]</li></ul>

</li><li>  Targets requiring different source addresses now go into different
  hostgroups, not only for host discovery but also for port scanning.
  Before, only responses to one of the source addresses would be
  processed, and the others would be ignored. [David]
</li><li>  Tidied up the version detection DB (nmap-service-probes) with a new
  cleanup/canonicalization program sv-tidy.  In particular, this:
<ul><li>Removes excess whitespace
</li><li>Sorts templates in the order m p v i d o h cpe:
</li><li>Canonicalizes template delimiters in the order: / | % = @ #.</li></ul>
  [David]
</li><li>  The --exclude and --excludefile options for excluding targets can
  now be used together. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added support for detecting whether a http connection was established
  using SSL or not to the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http.lua</a> library [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added local port to BPF filter in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-brute.html">snmp-brute</a> to fix bug that would
  prevent multiple scripts from receiving the correct responses. The bug was
  discovered by Brendan Bird. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Changed the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dhcp-discover.html">dhcp-discover</a> script to use the DHCPINFORM request
  to query dhcp servers instead of DHCPDISCOVER. Also removed DoS code
  from <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dhcp-discover.html">dhcp-discover</a> and placed the script into the discovery and safe
  categories. Added support for adding options to DHCP requests and
  cleaned up some code in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/dhcp.html">dhcp</a> library. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Applied patch to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-brute.html">snmp-brute</a> that solves problems with handling
  errors that occur during community list file parsing. [Duarte
  Silva]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added new fingerprints to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> for:
<ul><li>Subversion, CVS and Apache Archiva [Duarte Silva]
</li><li>DVCS systems Git, Mercurial and Bazaar [Hani Benhabiles].</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Applied some code cleanup to the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/snmp.html">snmp</a> library. [Brendan Byrd]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed an undeclared variable bug in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-ios-config.html">snmp-ios-config</a> [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Add additional version information to Mongodb scripts [Martin
  Swende]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added path argument to the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-auth.html">http-auth</a> script and update the
  script to use stdnse.format_output. [Duarte Silva, Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed bug in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http</a> library that would fail to parse
  authentication headers if no parameters were present. [Patrik]
</li><li>  Made a syntax change in the zenmap.desktop file for compliance with
  the XDG standard. [Frederik Schwarzer]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Replaced a number of GET requests to HEAD in http-
  fingerprints.lua.  HEAD is quicker and sufficient when no matching
  is performed on the returned contents.  [Hani Benhabiles]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added support for retrieving SSL certificates from FTP
  servers. [Matt Selsky]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> The --safe-payloads option is now the default. Added
  --include-payloads for the special situations where payloads are
  needed. [Colin Rice]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added new functionality and fixed some bugs in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/brute.html">brute</a> library:
<ul><li>Added support for restricting the number of guesses performed by the
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/brute.html">brute</a> library against users, to prevent account lockouts.
</li><li>Added support to guess the username as password. The documentation
    previously suggested (wrongly) that this was the default behavior.
</li><li>Added support to guess an empty string as password if not
    present in the dictionary. [Patrik]</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Re-enabled support for guessing the username in addition to password
  that was incorrectly removed from the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/metasploit-xmlrpc-brute.html">metasploit-xmlrpc-brute</a> in previous
  commit. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed bug that would prevent brute scripts from running if no service
  field was present in the port table. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Turned on promiscuous mode in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-sniffer.html">targets-sniffer</a>.nse so that it
  finds packets not only from or to the scanning host. [David]
</li><li>  The Zenmap topology display feature is now disabled when there are
  more than 1,000 target hosts.  Those topology maps slow down the
  interface and are generally too crowded to be of much use.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Modified the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http</a> library to support servers that don&#39;t return valid
  chunked encoded data, such as the Citrix XML service. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug where the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/brute.html">brute</a> library would not abort even after all
  retries were exhausted [Patrik]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in the IPv6 OS probe called NI. The Node Information
  Query didn&#39;t include the target address as the payload, so at least
  OS X didn&#39;t respond. This differed from the probe sent by the
  ipv6fp.py program from which some of our fingerprints were derived.
  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed an error in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/mssql.html">mssql</a> library that was causing the
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-ms-sql-discover.html">broadcast-ms-sql-discover</a> script to fail when trying to update port version
  information. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the missing broadcast category to the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-listener.html">broadcast-listener</a> script.
  [Jasey DePriest]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made changes to the categories of the following scripts (new
  categories shown) [Duarte Silva]:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-userdir-enum.html">http-userdir-enum</a>.nse (auth,intrusive)

</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-users.html">smb-enum-users</a>.nse (auth,intrusive)</li></ul>

</li><li>  Made nbase compile with the clang compiler that is a part of Xcode
  4.2. [Daniel J. Luke]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fix a nil table index bug discovered in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/mongodb.html">mongodb</a>
  library. [Thomas Buchanan]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added XMPP support to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a>.nse.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-wordpress-enum.html">http-wordpress-enum</a>.nse able to get names of users who
  have no posts. [Duarte Silva]
</li><li>  Increased hop distance estimates from OS detection by one. The
  distance now counts the number of hops including the final one to
  the target, not just the number of intermediate nodes. The IPv6
  distance calculation already worked this way. [David]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 5.61TEST2 [2011-09-30] <a class="versionlink" id="5.61TEST2" href="#5.61TEST2" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Added IPv6 OS detection system! The new system utilizes many tests
  similar to IPv4, and also some IPv6-specific ones that we found to
  be particularly effective. And it uses a machine learning approach
  rather than the static classifier we use for IPv4. We hope to move
  some of the IPv6 innovations back to our IPv4 system if they work
  out well. The database is still very small, so please submit any
  fingerprints that Nmap gives you to the specified URL (as long as
  you are certain that you know what the target system is
  running). Usage and results output are basically the same as with
  IPv4, but we will soon document the internal mechanisms at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html">https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html</a>, just as we have for IPv4. For an
  example, try &quot;nmap -6 -O scanme.nmap.org&quot;. [David, Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added 3 scripts, bringing the total to 246!  You can learn
  more about them at <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc">https://nmap.org/nsedoc</a>/. Here they are (authors
  listed in brackets):
<ul>
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/lltd-discovery.html">lltd-discovery</a> uses the Microsoft LLTD protocol to discover hosts
    on a local network. [Gorjan Petrovski]
<li>    ssl-google-cert-catalog queries Google&#39;s Certificate Catalog for
    the SSL certificates retrieved from target hosts. [Vasiliy Kulikov]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/quake3-info.html">quake3-info</a> extracts information from a Quake3-like game
    server. [Toni Ruottu]
</ul>
</li><li>  Improved AIX support for raw scans. This includes some patches
  originally written by Peter O&#39;Gorman and Florian Schmid. It also
  involved various build fixes found necessary on AIX 6.1 and 7.1. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/inst-other-platforms.html">https://nmap.org/book/inst-other-platforms.html</a> . [David]
</li><li>  Fixed Nmap so that it again compiles and runs on Solaris 10,
  including IPv6 support. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Moved our brute force authentication cracking scripts
  (*-brute) from the &quot;auth&quot; category into a new &quot;brute&quot;
  category. Nmap&#39;s brute force capabilities have grown tremendously!
  You can see all 32 of them at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/brute.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/brute.html</a> .  It isn&#39;t clear
  whether <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-brute.html">dns-brute</a> should be in the brute category, so for now it
  isn&#39;t. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Made the interface gathering loop work on Linux when an interface
  index is more than two digits in /proc/sys/if_inet6. Joe McEachern
  tracked down the problem and provided the fix.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/dns.html">dns.lua</a>: ensure that dns.query() always return two values
  (status, response) and replaced the workaround in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/asn-query.html">asn-query</a>.nse by the proper
  use. [Henri]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/irc-info.html">irc-info</a>.nse handle the case where the MOTD is missing.
  Patch by Sebastian Dragomir.

<li>  Added Common Platform Enumeration (CPE, <a href="http://cpe.mitre.org">http://cpe.mitre.org</a>/)
  output for OS and service versions. This is a standard way to
  identify operating systems and applications so that Nmap can
  better interoperate with other software. Nmap&#39;s own (generally more
  comprehensive) taxonomy/classification system is still supported as
  well. Some OS and version detection results don&#39;t have CPE entries
  yet. CPE entries show up in normal output with the headings &quot;OS
  CPE:&quot; and &quot;Service Info:&quot;:
<pre>
    OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:kernel:2.6.39
    Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:kernel
</pre>  These also appear in XML output, which additionally has CPE entries
  for service versions. [David, Henri]
</li><li>  Added IPv6 Neighbor Discovery ping. This is the IPv6 analog to IPv4
  ARP scan. It is the default ping type for local IPv6 networks.
  [Weilin]
</li><li>  Integrated your latest (IPv4) OS detection submissions and
  corrections until June 22. New fingerprints include Linux 3, FreeBSD
  9, Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), and 300+ more. The DB size increased 11% to
  3,308 fingerprints. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/556">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/556</a>. Please keep those
  fingerprints coming! We now accept IPv4 and IPv6 OS fingerprints as
  well as service fingerprints, plus corrections of all types if Nmap
  guess wrong.

<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-ipv6-multicast-echo.html">targets-ipv6-multicast-echo</a> sends an ICMPv6 echo request packet to
    the all-nodes link-local multicast address (ff02::1) to discover
    responsive hosts on a LAN without needing to individually ping
    each IPv6 address. [David Fifield, Xu Weilin]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-ipv6-multicast-invalid-dst.html">targets-ipv6-multicast-invalid-dst</a> sends an ICMPv6 packet with an
    invalid extension header to the all-nodes link-local multicast
    address (ff02::1) to discover (some) available hosts on the

</ul>
</li><li>  Fixed compilation on OS X 10.7 Lion. Thanks to Patrik Karlsson and
  Babak Farroki for researching fixes.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The script arguments which start with a script name
  (e.g. <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-brute.html">http-brute</a>.hostname or <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-ls.html">afp-ls</a>.maxfiles) can now accept the
  unqualified arguments as well (hostname, maxfiles). This lets you
  use the generic version (&quot;hostname&quot;) when you want to affect
  multiple scripts, while using the qualified version to target
  individual scripts. If both are specified, the qualified version
  takes precedence for that particular script. This works for library
  script arguments too (e.g. you can specify &#39;timelimit&#39; rather than
  unpwdb.timelimit). [Paulino]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Updated SSL certificate store (ca-bundle.crt), primarily to
  remove the epic fail known as DigiNotar.
</li><li>  Nmap now defers options parsing until it has read through all the
  command line arguments.  This removes the few remaining cases where
  option order mattered (for example, IPv6 users previously had to
  specify -6 before -S). [Shinnok]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new default credential list for Oracle databases and
  modified the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/oracle-brute.html">oracle-brute</a> script to make use of it. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Our Packet library (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/packet.html">packet.lua</a>) now handles IPv6. This is used
  by the new multicast IPv6 host discovery scripts
  (targets-ipv6-*). [Weilin]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Replaced xmpp.nse with an an overhauled version named
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/xmpp-info.html">xmpp-info</a>.nse which brings many new features and fixes. [Vasiliy Kulikov]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed SSL compressor names in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html">ssl-enum-ciphers</a>.nse, and
  removed redundant multiple listings of the NULL compressor.
  [Matt Selsky]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added cipher strength ratings to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html">ssl-enum-ciphers</a>.nse.
  [Gabriel Lawrence]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssh2-enum-algos.html">ssh2-enum-algos</a> script that would prevent it from
  displaying any output unless run in debug mode. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added 4 more protocol libraries. You can learn more about any
  of them at <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc">https://nmap.org/nsedoc</a>/. Here are the new ones (authors
  listed in brackets):
<ul>
<li>    bittorrent supports the BitTorrent file sharing protocol [Gorjan
    Petrovski]
<li>    cvs includes support for the Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
    [Patrik Karlsson]
<li>    sasl provides common code for &quot;Simple Authentication and Security
    Layer&quot; to services supporting it. The algorithms supported by the
    library are: PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM. [Djalal
    Harouni, Patrik Karlsson]
<li>    xmpp handles XMPP (Jabber) IM servers [Patrik Karlsson]
</ul>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Removed the mac-geolocation script, which relied on a Google
  database to determine strikingly accurate GPS coordinates for
  anyone&#39;s wireless access points (based on their MAC address).  It
  was very powerful.  Perhaps Google decided it was too powerful, as
  they discontinued the service before our script was even 2 months
  old.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Added an --append-output option which, when used along with
  -o and/or -x, prevents clobbering (truncating) an existing
  file. [Shinnok]
</li><li>  Fixed RPC scan (part of -sV) to work on the 64-bit machines where
  &quot;unsigned long&quot; is 8 bytes rather than 4.  We now use the more
  portable u32 in the code. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Moved some scripts into the default category: <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/giop-info.html">giop-info</a>,
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/vnc-info.html">vnc-info</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ncp-serverinfo.html">ncp-serverinfo</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-security-mode.html">smb-security-mode</a>, and and
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-serverinfo.html">afp-serverinfo</a>. [Djalal]
</li><li>  Relaxed the XML DTD to allow validation of files where the verbosity
  level changed during the scan.  Also made a service confidence of 8
  (used when tcpwrapped) or any other number between 0 and 10
  legal. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed authentication problems in the TNS library that would prevent
  authentication from working against Oracle 11.2.0.2.0 XE [Chris Woodbury]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added basic query support to the Oracle TNS library so that scripts
  can now make SQL queries against database servers.  Also improved
  support for 64-bit database servers and improved the documentation. [Patrik]
</li><li>  Removed some restrictions on probe matching that, for example,
  prevented a RST/ACK reply from being recognized in a NULL scan. This
  was found and fixed by Matthew Stickney and Joe McEachern.
</li><li>  Rearranged some characters classes in service matches to avoid any
  that look like POSIX collating symbols (&quot;[.xyz.]&quot;). John Hutchison
  discovered this error caused by one of the match lines:
<pre>
    InitMatch: illegal regexp: POSIX collating elements are not supported
</pre>  [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added more than 100 new signatures to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> (many for
  known vulnerabilities). They are in the categories: general,
  attacks, cms, security, management and database [Paulino]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Updated account status text in brute force password discovery
  scripts in an effort to make the reporting more consistent across
  all scripts.  This will have an impact on any code that parses these
  values.  [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  Nmap now includes the Liblinear library for large linear
  classification (<a href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw">http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw</a>/~cjlin/liblinear/). We
  are using it for the upcoming IPv6 OS detection system, and (if that
  works out well) may eventually use it for IPv4 too.  It uses a
  three-clause BSD license.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Better error messages (including a traceback) are now provided
  when script loading fails. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Prevent Zenmap from deleting ports when merging scans
  results based on newer scans which did not actually scan the ports
  in question. Additionally Zenmap now only updates ports with new
  information if the new information uses the same protocol--not just
  the same port number. [Colin Rice]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed a crash which would occur when --ssl-verify is combined
  with -vvv on windows. [Colin Rice]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Added new --safe-payloads option for echo mode which causes
  returned packet payloads to be zeroed to reduce privacy risks if
  Nping echo server was to accidentally (or through malicious intent)
  return a packet which wasn&#39;t sent by the Nping echo client.  We hope
  to soon make this behavior the default. [Luis]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that would make Nmap segfault if it failed to open an
  interface using pcap. The bug details and patch are posted at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/365">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/365</a> [Patrik]
</li><li>  Ncat SCTP mode now supports connection brokering
  (--sctp --broker). [Shinnok]
</li><li>  Consolidated a bunch of duplicate code between Ncat&#39;s listen
  (ncat_listen.c) and broker (ncat_broker.c) modes to ease
  maintenance. [Shinnok]
</li><li>  Added a &#39;nostore&#39; nse argument to the brute force library which
  prevents the brute force authentication cracking scripts from
  storing found credentials in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/creds.html">creds</a> library (they will still be
  printed in script output).
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed the nsedebug print_hex() function so it does not print an
  empty line if there are no remaining characters, and improved its NSEDoc.
  [Chris Woodbury].
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Ncat no longer blocks while an ssl handshake is taking place
  or waiting to complete.  This could make listening Ncat instances
  unavailable to other clients because one client was taking too long
  to complete the SSL handshake.  Our public Ncat chat server is now
  much more reliable (connect with: ncat --ssl -v chat.nmap.org).
  [Shinnok]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Updated SMTP and IMAP libraries to support authentication
  using both plain-text and the SASL library. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The Zenmap crash handler now instructs users to mail in
  crash information to nmap-dev rather than offering to create a
  Sourceforge bug tracker entry. [Colin Rice]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Applied patch from Chris Woodbury that adds the following
  additional information to the output of <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html">smb-os-discovery</a>: NetBIOS
  computer name, NetBIOS domain name, FQDN, and forest name.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Updated <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-brute.html">smb-brute</a> to add detection for valid credentials where the
  target account was expired or limited by time or login host constraints.
  [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Ncat now supports IPV6 addresses by default without the -6 flag.
  Additionally ncat listens on both ::1 and localhost when passed
  -l, or any other listening mode unless a specific listening address is
  supplied. [Colin Rice]
</li><li>  Fixed broken XML output in the case of timed-out hosts; the
  enclosing host element was missing. The fix was suggested by R&eacute;mi
  Mollon.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Multiple <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-brute.html">ldap-brute</a> changes by Tom Sellers:
<ul><li>Added support for 2008 R2 functional level Active Directory instances
</li><li>Added detection for valid credentials where the target account was
    expired or limited by time or login host constraints.
</li><li>Added support for specifying a UPN suffix to be appended to usernames
    when brute forcing Microsoft Active Directory accounts.
</li><li>Added support for saving discovered credentials to a CSV file.
</li><li>Now reports valid credentials as they are discovered when the script
    is run with -vv or higher.</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-search.html">ldap-search</a>.nse - Added support for saving search results to
  CSV.  This is done by using the ldap.savesearch script argument to
  specify an output filename prefix.  [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  Handle an unconventional IPv6 internal link-local address convention
  used by Mac OS X. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/906">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/906</a>. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Optimized stdnse.format_output (changing the data structures)
  to improve performance for scripts which produce a lot of output. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/623">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/623</a>. [Djalal]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fix <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nping-brute.html">nping-brute</a> so that it again works on IPv6. [Toni Ruottu]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the make_array and make_object functions to our <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/json.html">json</a>
  library, allowing LUA tables to be treated as JSON arrays or
  objects. See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/15">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q3/15</a> [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ip-geolocation-ipinfodb.html">ip-geolocation-ipinfodb</a> now allows you to specify an
  IPInfoDB API key using the apikey NSE argument. [Gorjan]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Renamed http-wp-plugins to http-wordpress-plugins script for
  consistency with <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-wordpress-brute.html">http-wordpress-brute</a> and now

    mechanisms (CVE-2011-1720).  This vulnerability can allow denial
    of service and possibly remote code execution. [Djalal Harouni]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-ios-config.html">snmp-ios-config</a>: Attempts to downloads Cisco router IOS
    configuration files using SNMP RW (v1) and display or save
    them. [Vikas Singhal, Patrik Karlsson]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-known-key.html">ssl-known-key</a>: Checks whether the SSL certificate used by a host
    has a fingerprint that matches an included database of problematic
    keys. [Mak Kolybabi]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-sniffer.html">targets-sniffer</a>: Sniffs the local network for a configurable
    amount of time (10 seconds by default) and prints discovered
    addresses. If the newtargets script argument is set, discovered
    addresses are added to the scan queue. [Nick Nikolaou]
<li>    xmpp: Connects to an XMPP server (port 5222) and collects server
    information such as supported auth mechanisms, compression methods
    and whether TLS is supported and mandatory. [Vasiliy Kulikov]
</ul>
</li><li>  Nmap has long supported IPv6 for basic (connect) port scans, basic
  host discovery, version detection, Nmap Scripting Engine.  This
  release dramatically expands and improves IPv6 support:
<ul><li>IPv6 raw packet scans (including SYN scan, UDP scan, ACK scan,
    etc.) are now supported. [David, Weilin]
</li><li>IPv6 raw packet host discovery (IPv6 echo requests, TCP/UDP
    discovery packets, etc.) is now supported. [David, Weilin]
</li><li>IPv6 traceroute is now supported [David]
</li><li>IPv6 protocol scan (-sO) is now supported, including creating
    realistic headers for many protocols. [David]
</li><li>IPv6 support to the wsdd, dnssd and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/upnp.html">upnp</a> NSE libraries. [Daniel
    Miller, Patrik]
</li><li>The --exclude and --excludefile now support IPV6 addresses with
    netmasks.  [Colin]</li></ul>

</li><li>  Scanme.Nmap.Org (the system anyone is allowed to scan for testing
  purposes) is now dual-stacked (has an IPv6 address as well as IPv4)
  so you can scan it during IPv6 testing.  We also added a DNS record
  for ScanmeV6.nmap.org which is IPv6-only. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/428">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/428</a>. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  The Nmap.Org website as well as sister sites Insecure.Org,
  SecLists.Org, and SecTools.Org all have working IPv6 addresses now
  (dual stacked). [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Nmap now determines the filesystem location it is being run from and
  that path is now included early in the search path for data files
  (such as nmap-services).  This reduces the likelihood of needing to
  specify --datadir or getting data files from a different version of
  Nmap installed on the system.  For full details, see
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/data-files-replacing-data-files.html">https://nmap.org/book/data-files-replacing-data-files.html</a> .  Thanks
  to Solar Designer for implementation advice. [David]
</li><li>  Created a page on our SecWiki for collecting Nmap script ideas! If
  you have a good idea, post it to the incoming section of the page.
  Or if you&#39;re in a script writing mood but don&#39;t know what to write,
  come here for inspiration: <a href="https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap_Script_Ideas.">https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap_Script_Ideas.</a>
</li><li>  The development pace has greatly increased because Google (again)
  sponsored a 7 full-time college and graduate student programmer
  interns this summer as part of their Summer of Code program!
  Thanks, Google Open Source Department!  We&#39;re delighted to introduce
  the team: <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/312">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/312</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added 7 new protocol libraries, bringing the total to 66.  You
  can read about them all at <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc">https://nmap.org/nsedoc</a>/. Here are the new
  ones (authors listed in brackets):
<ul>
<li>    creds: Handles storage and retrieval of discovered credentials
    (such as passwords discovered by brute force scripts). [Patrik
    Karlsson]
<li>    ncp: A tiny implementation of Novell Netware Core Protocol
    (NCP). [Patrik Karlsson]
<li>    omp2: OpenVAS Management Protocol (OMP) version 2 support. [Henri
    Doreau]
<li>    sip: Supports a limited subset of SIP commands and
    methods. [Patrik Karlsson]
<li>    smtp: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) operations. [Djalal
    Harouni]
<li>    srvloc: A relatively small implementation of the Service Location
    Protocol. [Patrik Karlsson]
<li>    tftp: Implements a minimal TFTP server. It is used in
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-ios-config.html">snmp-ios-config</a> to obtain router config files.[Patrik Karlsson]
</ul>
</li><li>  Improved Nmap&#39;s service/version detection database by adding:
<ul><li>Apple iPhoto (DPAP) protocol probe [Patrik]
</li><li>Zend Java Bridge probe [Michael Schierl]
</li><li>BackOrifice probe [Gorjan Petrovski]
</li><li>GKrellM probe [Toni Ruottu]
</li><li>Signature improvements for a wide variety of services (we now have
    7,375 signatures)</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssh-hostkey.html">ssh-hostkey</a> now additionally has a postrule that prints hosts
  found during the scan which share the same hostkey. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added 300+ new signatures to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> which look for admin
  directories, JBoss, Tomcat, TikiWiki, Majordomo2, MS SQL, Wordpress,
  and more. [Paulino]
</li><li>  Made the final IP address space assignment update as all available
  IPv4 address blocks have now been allocated to the regional
  registries.  Our random IP generation (-iR) logic now only excludes
  the various reserved blocks.  Thanks to Kris for years of regular
  updates to this function!
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Replaced <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-trace.html">http-trace</a> with a new more effective version. [Paulino]
</li><li>  Performed some output cleanup work to remove unimportant status
  lines so that it is easier to find the good stuff! [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> now properly kills Nmap scan subprocess when you cancel a
  scan or quit Zenmap on Windows. [Shinnok]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Banned scripts from being in both the &quot;default&quot; and
  &quot;intrusive&quot; categories.  We did this by removing <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dhcp-discover.html">dhcp-discover</a> and
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-zone-transfer.html">dns-zone-transfer</a> from the set of scripts run by default (leaving
  them &quot;intrusive&quot;), and reclassifying <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-recursion.html">dns-recursion</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-bounce.html">ftp-bounce</a>,
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-open-proxy.html">http-open-proxy</a>, and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/socks-open-proxy.html">socks-open-proxy</a> as &quot;safe&quot; rather than
  &quot;intrusive&quot; (keeping them in the &quot;default&quot; set).
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a credential storage library (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/creds.html">creds.lua</a>) and modified
  the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/brute.html">brute</a> library and scripts to make use of it. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Created a portable version of ncat.exe that you can just drop
  onto Microsoft Windows systems without having to run any installer
  or copy over extra library files. See the Ncat page
  (<a href="https://nmap.org/ncat">https://nmap.org/ncat</a>/) for binary downloads and a link to build
  instructions. [Shinnok]
</li><li>  Fix a segmentation fault which could occur when running Nmap on
  various Android-based phones.  The problem related to NULL being
  passed to freeaddrinfo(). [David, Vlatko Kosturjak]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The host.bin_ip and host.bin_ip_src entries now also work with
  16-byte IPv6 addresses. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Updated the ca-bundle.crt list of trusted certificate
  authority certificates. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug in the SMB Authentication library which could
  prevent concurrently running scripts with valid credentials from
  logging in. [Chris Woodbury]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Re-worked <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-form-brute.html">http-form-brute</a>.nse to better autodetect form
  fields, allow brute force attempts where only the password (no
  username) is needed, follow HTTP redirects, and better detect
  incorrect login attempts. [Patrik, Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Changed the &quot;slow comprehensive scan&quot; profile&#39;s NSE script
  selection from &quot;all&quot; to &quot;default or (discovery and safe)&quot;
  categories.  Except for testing and debugging, &quot;--script all&quot; is
  rarely desirable.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the stdnse.silent_require method which is used for
  library requires that you know might fail (e.g. &quot;openssl&quot; fails if
  Nmap was compiled without that library).  If these libraries are
  called with silent_require and fail to load, the script will cease
  running but the user won&#39;t be presented with ugly failure messages
  as would happen with a normal require. [Patrick Donnelly]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a bug in topology mapper which caused endpoints
  behind firewalls to sometimes show up in the wrong place (see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/733">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/733</a>).  [Colin Rice]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> If you scan a system twice, any open ports from the first
  scan which are closed in the 2nd will be properly marked as
  closed. [Colin Rice].
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed an error that could cause a crash (&quot;TypeError: an
  integer is required&quot;) if a sort column in the ports table was unset.
  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> Added nmaprun element information (Nmap version, scan date,
  etc.) to the diff.  Also, the Nmap <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/banner.html">banner</a> with version number and
  data is now only printed if there were other differences in the
  scan. [Daniel Miller, David, Dr. Jesus]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added nmap.get_interface and nmap.get_interface_info functions
  so scripts can access characteristics of the scanning interface.
  Removed nmap.get_interface_link. [Djalal]
</li><li>  Fixed an overflow in scan elapsed time display that caused negative
  times to be printed after about 25 days. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Updated nmap-rpc from the master list, now maintained by IANA.
  [Daniel Miller, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a bug in the option parser: -sN (null scan) was
  interpreted as -sn (no port scan). This was reported by
  Shitaneddine. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> Fixed the Mac OS X packages to use the correct path for
  Python: /usr/bin/python instead of /opt/local/bin/python. The bug
  was reported by Wellington Castello. [David]
</li><li>  Removed the -sR (RPC scan) option--it is now an alias for -sV
  (version scan), which always does RPC scan when an <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcinfo.html">rpcinfo</a> service
  is detected.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Improved the ms-sql scripts and library in several ways:
<ul><li>Improved version detection and server discovery
</li><li>Added support for named pipes, integrated authentication, and
    connecting to instances by name or port
</li><li>Improved script and library stability and documentation.</li></ul>
  [Patrik Karlsson, Chris Woodbury]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed http.validate_options when handling a cookie table.
  [Sebastian Prengel]
</li><li>  Added a Service Tags UDP probe for port 6481/udp. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Enabled <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/firewalk.html">firewalk</a>.nse to automatically find the gateways at
  which probes are dropped and fixed various bugs. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Worked around a pycairo bug that prevented saving the
  topology graphic as PNG on Windows: &quot;Error Saving Snapshot:
  Surface.write_to_png takes one argument which must be a filename
  (str), file object, or a file-like object which has a &#39;write&#39; method
  (like StringIO)&quot;. The problem was reported by Alex Kah. [David]
</li><li>  The -V and --version options now show the platform Nmap was compiled
  on, which features are compiled in, the version numbers of libraries
  it is linked against, and whether the libraries are the ones that
  come with Nmap or the operating system.  [Ambarisha B., David]
</li><li>  Fixed some inconsistencies in nmap-os-db reported by Xavier Sudre
  from netVigilance.
</li><li>  The Nmap Win32 uninstaller now properly deletes nping.exe. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a shortport.ssl function which can be used as a script
  portrule to match SSL services.  It is similar in concept to our
  existing shortport.http. [David]
</li><li>  Set up the RPM build to use the compat-glibc and compat-gcc-34-c++
  packages (on CentOS 5.3) to resolve a report of Nmap failing to run
  on old versions of Glibc. [David]
</li><li>  We no longer support Nmap on versions of Windows earlier than XP
  SP2.  Even Microsoft no longer supports Windows versions that old.
  But if you must use Nmap on such systems anyway, please see
  <a href="https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap_On_Old_Windows_Releases.">https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap_On_Old_Windows_Releases.</a>
</li><li>  There were hundreds of other little bug fixes and improvements
  (especially to NSE scripts).  See the SVN logs for revisions 22,274
  through 24,460 for details.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 5.51 [2011-02-11] <a class="versionlink" id="5.51" href="#5.51" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> Added support for prerule and postrule scripts. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug which caused some NSE scripts to fail due to the
  absence of the NSE SCRIPT_NAME environment variable when loaded.
  Michael Pattrick reported the problem. [Djalal]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Selecting one of the scan targets in the left pane is
  supposed to jump to that host in the Nmap Output in the right pane
  (but it wasn&#39;t).  Brian Krebs reported this bug. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed an obscure bug in Windows interface matching. If the MAC
  address of an interface couldn&#39;t be retrieved, it might have been
  used instead of the correct interface. Alexander Khodyrev reported
  the problem.  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed portrules in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-zone-transfer.html">dns-zone-transfer</a> and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-proftpd-backdoor.html">ftp-proftpd-backdoor</a>
  that used shortport functions incorrectly and always returned
  true. [Jost Krieger]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> Fixed ndiff.dtd to include two elements that can be diffed:
  status and address. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> Fixed the ordering of hostscript-related elements in XML
  output. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nrpe-enum.html">nrpe-enum</a> script that would make it run for
  every port (when it was selected--it isn&#39;t by default).  Daniel
  Miller reported the bug. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> When an NSE script sets a negative socket timeout, it now
  causes a controlled Lua stack trace instead of a fatal error.
  Vlatko Kosturjak reported the bug. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Worked around an error that caused the py2app bootstrap
  executable to be non-universal even when the rest of the application
  was universal. This prevented the binary .dmg from working on
  PowerPC. Yxynaxen reported the problem. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> Fixed an output line that wasn&#39;t being redirected to a file
  when all other output was. [Daniel Miller]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 5.50 [2011-01-28] <a class="versionlink" id="5.50" href="#5.50" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added a new script selection interface, allowing you to
  choose scripts and arguments from a list which includes descriptions
  of every available script. Just click the &quot;Scripting&quot; tab in the
  profile editor. [Kirubakaran]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Added echo mode, a novel technique for discovering how your
  packets are changed (or dropped) in transit between the host they
  originated and a target machine. It can detect network address
  translation, packet filtering, routing anomalies, and more.  You can
  try it out against our public Nping echo server using this command:
<pre>
    nping --echo-client &quot;public&quot; echo.nmap.org&#39;
</pre>  Or learn more about echo mode at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nping-man-echo-mode.html">https://nmap.org/book/nping-man-echo-mode.html</a> . [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added an amazing 46 scripts, bringing the total to 177! You

    SMB have a hard global limit of 11 connections for user accounts
    and 10 connections for anonymous. Once that limit is reached,
    further connections are denied. This script exploits that limit by
    taking up all the connections and holding them. [Ron Bowes]

</ul>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added 12 new protocol libraries:

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/brute.html">brute</a> library that provides a basic framework and logic
  for brute force password auditing scripts. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Greatly improved performance for large scans by
  benchmarking intensively and then recoding dozens of slow parts.
  Time taken to load our benchmark file (a scan of just over a million
  IPs belonging to Microsoft corporation, with 74,293 hosts up) was
  reduced from hours to less than two minutes. Memory consumption
  decreased dramatically as well. [David]
</li><li>  Performed a major OS detection integration run. The database has
  grown more than 14% to 2,982 fingerprints and many of the existing
  fingerprints were improved. Highlights include Linux 2.6.37, iPhone
  OS 4.2.1, Solaris 11, AmigaOS 3.1, GNU Hurd 0.3, and MINIX 2.0.4.
  David posted highlights of his integration work at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/651">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/651</a>
</li><li>  Performed a huge version detection integration run. The number of
  signatures has grown by more than 11% to 7,355.  More than a third
  of our signatures are for http, but we also detect 743 other service
  protocols, from abc, acap, access-remote-pc, and achat to zenworks,
  zeo, and zmodem.  David posted highlights at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/761.">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/761.</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/target.html">target</a> NSE library which allows scripts to add newly
  discovered targets to Nmap&#39;s scanning queue. This allows Nmap to
  support a wide range of target acquisition techniques. Scripts which
  can now use this feature include <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-zone-transfer.html">dns-zone-transfer</a>, hostmap,
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-info.html">ms-sql-info</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-interfaces.html">snmp-interfaces</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-traceroute.html">targets-traceroute</a>, and several
  more. [Djalal]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Nmap has two new NSE script scanning phases. The new pre-scan
  occurs before Nmap starts scanning. Some of the initial pre-scan
  scripts use techniques like broadcast DNS service discovery or DNS
  zone transfers to enumerate hosts which can optionally be treated as
  targets. The other phase (post scan) runs after all of Nmap&#39;s
  scanning is complete. We don&#39;t have any of these scripts yet, but
  they could compile scan statistics or present the results in a
  different way. One idea is a reverse index which provides a list of
  services discovered during a network scan, along with a list of IPs
  found to be running each service. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-script-types">https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-script-types</a>. [Djalal]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> A new --script-help option describes all scripts matching a
  given specification. It accepts the same specification format as
  --script does. For example, try &#39;nmap --script-help &quot;default or
  http-*&quot;&#39;. [David, Martin Holst Swende]
</li><li>  Dramatically improved nmap.xsl (used for converting Nmap XML output
  to HTML). In particular:
<ul><li>Put verbose details behind expander buttons so you can see them if
    you want, but they don&#39;t distract from the main output.  In
    particular, offline hosts and traceroute results are collapsed by
    default.
</li><li>Improved the color scheme to be less garish.
</li><li>Added support for the new NSE pre-scan and post-scan phases.
</li><li>Changed script output to use &#39;pre&#39; tags to keep even lengthy
    output readable.
</li><li>Added a floating menu to the lower-right for toggling whether
    closed/filtered ports are shown or not (they are now hidden by
    default if Javascript is enabled).</li></ul>
  Many smaller improvements were made as well. You can find the new
  file at <a href="https://nmap.org/svn/docs/nmap.xsl">https://nmap.org/svn/docs/nmap.xsl</a>, and here is an example
  scan processed through it: <a href="https://nmap.org/book/output-formats-output-to-html.html">https://nmap.org/book/output-formats-output-to-html.html</a> . [Tom]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Created a new &quot;broadcast&quot; script category for the broadcast-*
  scripts.  These perform network discovery by broadcasting on the
  local network and listening for responses.  Since they don&#39;t
  directly relate to targets specified on the command line, these are
  kept out of the default category (nor do they go in &quot;discovery&quot;).
</li><li>  Integrated cracked passwords from the Gawker.com compromise
  (<a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/674">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/674</a>) into Nmap&#39;s top-5000
  password database. A team of Nmap developers lead by Brandon Enright
  has cracked 635,546 out of 748,081 password hashes so far
  (85%). Gawker doesn&#39;t exactly have the most sophisticated users on
  the Internet--their top passwords are &quot;123456&quot;, &quot;password&quot;,
  &quot;12345678&quot;, &quot;lifehack&quot;, &quot;qwerty&quot;, &quot;abc123&quot;, &quot;12345&quot;, &quot;monkey&quot;,
  &quot;111111&quot;, &quot;consumer&quot;, and &quot;letmein&quot;.
</li><li>  XML output now excludes output for down hosts when only doing host
  discovery, unless verbosity (-v) was requested. This is how it
  already worked for normal scans, but the ping-only case was
  overlooked.  [David]
</li><li>  Updated the Windows build process to work with (and require) Visual
  C++ 2010 rather than 2008.  If you want to build Zenmap too, you now
  need Python 2.7 (rather than 2.6) and GTK+ 2.22. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html#inst-win-source">https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html#inst-win-source</a> [David, Rob
  Nicholls, KX]
</li><li>  Merged port names in the nmap-services file with allocated names
  from the IANA (<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers</a>). We
  only added IANA names which were &quot;unknown&quot; in our file--we didn&#39;t
  deal with conflicting names. [David]
</li><li>  Enabled the ASLR and DEP security technologies for Nmap.exe,
  Ncat.exe and Nping.exe on Windows Vista and above. Visual C++ will
  set the /DYNAMICBASE and /NXCOMPAT flags in the PE
  header. Executables generated using py2exe or NSIS and third party
  binaries (OpenSSL, WinPcap) still don&#39;t support ASLR or DEP. Support
  for DEP on XP SP3, using SetProcessDEPPolicy(), could still be
  implemented. See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/328">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/328</a>. [Robert]
</li><li>  Investigated using the CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) standard
  for describing operating systems, devices, and service names for
  Nmap OS and service detection. You can read David&#39;s reports at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/278">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/278</a> and
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/303.">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/303.</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Improved the output viewer to show new output in constant
  time. Previously it would get slower and slower as the output grew
  longer, eventually making Zenmap appear to freeze with 100% CPU. Rob
  Nicholls and Ray Middleton helped with testing. [David]
</li><li>  The Linux RPM builds of Nmap and related tools (ncat, nping, etc.)
  now link to system libraries dynamically rather than statically.
  They still link statically to dependency libraries such as OpenSSL,
  Lua, LibPCRE, Libpcap, etc. We hope this will improve portability so
  the RPMs will work on distributions with older software (like RHEL,
  Debian stable) as well as more bleeding edge ones like
  Fedora. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the ability to send and receive on unconnected sockets.
  This can be used, for example, to receive UDP broadcasts without
  having to use Libpcap. A number of scripts have been changed so that
  they can work as prerule scripts to discover services by UDP
  broadcasting, and optionally add the discovered targets to the
  scanning queue:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-info.html">ms-sql-info</a>
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/upnp-info.html">upnp-info</a>
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-service-discovery.html">dns-service-discovery</a></li></ul>
  The nmap.new_socket function can now optionally take a default
  protocol and address family, which will be used if the socket is not
  connected. There is a new nmap.sendto function to be used with
  unconnected UDP sockets. [David, Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Substantially improved the Nping man page. You can read it
  online at <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nping-man.html">https://nmap.org/book/nping-man.html</a> . [Luis, David]
</li><li>  Documented the licenses of the third-party software used by Nmap and
  its sibling tools:
  <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/3rd-party-licenses.txt">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/3rd-party-licenses.txt</a> . [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Improved the SMB scripts so that they can run in parallel
  rather than using a mutex to force serialization.  This quadrupled
  the SMB scan speed in one large scale test.  See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/819">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/819</a>. [Ron]
</li><li>  Added a simple Nmap NSE script template to make writing new scripts
  easier: <a href="https://nmap.org/svn/docs/sample-script.nse">https://nmap.org/svn/docs/sample-script.nse</a>. [Ron]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Made the topology node radiuses grow logarithmically
  instead of linearly, so that hosts with thousands of open ports
  don&#39;t overwhelm the diagram. Also only open ports (not
  open|filtered) are considered when calculating node sizes. Henri
  Doreau found and fixed a bug in the implementation. [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the get_script_args NSE function for parsing script
  arguments in a clean and standardized way
  (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/stdnse.html#get_script_args">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/stdnse.html#get_script_args</a>). [Djalal]
</li><li>  Increased the initial RTT timeout for ARP scans from 100 ms to 200
  ms. Some wireless and VPN links were taking around 300 ms to
  respond. The default of one retransmission gives them 400 ms to be
  detected.
</li><li>  Added new version detection probes and signatures from Patrik for:
<ul><li>Lotus Domino Console running on tcp/2050 (shows OS and hostname)
</li><li>IBM Informix Dynamic Server running native protocol (shows hostname, and file path)
</li><li>Database servers running the DRDA protocol
</li><li>IBM Websphere MQ (shows name of queue-manager and channel)</li></ul>

</li><li>  Fix Nmap compilation on OpenSolaris (see
  <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sdaven/entry/nmap_5_35dc1_compile_on">http://blogs.sun.com/sdaven/entry/nmap_5_35dc1_compile_on</a>) [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http</a> library&#39;s request functions now accept an additional
  &quot;auth&quot; table within the option table, which causes Basic
  authentication credentials to be sent. [David]
</li><li>  Improved IPv6 host output in that we now remember and report the
  forward DNS name (given by the user) and any non-scanned addresses
  (usually because of round robin DNS).  We already did this for
  IPv4. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Upgraded to the newer gtk.Tooltip API to avoid deprecation
  messages about gtk.Tooltip. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-zone-transfer.html">dns-zone-transfer</a> script able to add new discovered DNS
  records to the Nmap scanning queue. [Djalal]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Enhance <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a> to also report the type and bit size of SSL
  certificate public keys [Matt Selsky]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Make --exec and --idle-timeout work when connecting with
  --proxy. Florian Roth reported the bug. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Fixed a bug which caused Nping to fail when targeting
  broadcast addresses (see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/752">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/752</a>). [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Nping now limits concurrent open file descriptors properly
  based on the resources available on the host (see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/2">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/2</a>). [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Improved ssh2&#39;s kex_init() parameters: all of the algorithm
  and language lists can be set using new keys in the &quot;options&quot; table
  argument. These all default to the same value used before. Also, the
  required &quot;cookie&quot; argument is now replaced by an optional &quot;cookie&quot;
  key in the &quot;options&quot; table, defaulting to random bytes as suggested
  by the RFC. [Kris]
</li><li>  Ncat now logs Nsock debug output to stderr instead of stdout for
  consistency with its other debug messages. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new function, shortport.http, for HTTP script
  portrules and changed 14 scripts to use it. [David]
</li><li>  Updated to the latest config.guess and config.sub. Thanks to Ty
  Miller for a reminder. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added prerule support to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-interfaces.html">snmp-interfaces</a> and the ability to
  add the remote host&#39;s interface addresses to the scanning queue.
  The new script arguments used for this functionality are &quot;host&quot;
  (required) and &quot;port&quot; (optional). [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed some inconsistencies in nmap-os-db and a small memory leak
  that would happen where there was more than one round of OS
  detection. These were reported by Xavier Sudre from
  netVigilance. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug with worker threads calling the wrong destructors.
  Fixing this allows better parallelism in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-brute.html">http-brute</a>.nse. The problem
  was reported by Patrik Karlsson. [David, Patrick]
</li><li>  Upgraded the OpenSSL binaries shipped in our Windows installer to
  version 1.0.0a. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added prerule support to the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-zone-transfer.html">dns-zone-transfer</a> script,
  allowing it to run early to discover IPs from DNS records and
  optionally add those IPs to Nmap&#39;s target queue.  You must specify
  the DNS server and domain name to use with script
  arguments. [Djalal]
</li><li>  Changed the name of libdnet&#39;s sctp_chunkhdr to avoid a conflict with
  a struct of the same name in netinet/sctp.h. This caused a
  compilation error when Nmap was compiled with an OpenSSL that had
  SCTP support. [Olli Hauer, Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Implemented a big cleanup of the Nmap NSE Nsock library
  binding code. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Added a bunch of Apple and Netatalk AFP service detection
  signatures.  These often provide extra details such as whether the
  target is a MacBook Pro, Air, Mac Mini, iMac, etc. [Brandon]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Host tables now have a host.traceroute member available when
  --traceroute is used. This array contains the IP address, reverse
  DNS name, and RTT for each traceroute hop. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-anon.html">ftp-anon</a> script return a directory listing when
  anonymous login is allowed. [Gutek, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the nmap.resolve() function. It takes a host name and
  optionally an address family (such as &quot;inet&quot;) and returns a table
  containing all of its matching addresses. If no address family is
  specified, all addresses for the name are returned. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the nmap.address_family() function which returns the address
  family Nmap is using as a string (e.g., &quot;inet6&quot; is returned if Nmap is
  called with the -6 option). [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Scripts can now access the MTU of the host.interface device using
  host.interface_mtu. [Kris]
</li><li>  Restrict the default Windows DLL search path by removing the current
  directory. This adds extra protection against DLL hijacking attacks,
  especially if we were to add file type associations to Nmap in the
  future. We implement this with the SetDllDirectory function when
  available (Windows XP SP1 and later). Otherwise, we call
  SetCurrentDirectory with the directory containing the
  executable. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap now prints the MTU for interfaces in --iflist output. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Removed references to the MD2 algorithm, which OpenSSL 1.x.x
  no longer supports. [Alexandru]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat,NSE]</span> Server Name Indication (SNI) is now supported by Ncat and
  Nmap NSE, allowing them to connect to servers which run multiple SSL
  websites on one IP address. To enable this for NSE, the nmap.connect
  function has been changed to accept host and port tables (like those
  provided to the action function) in place of a string and a
  number. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Renamed db2-info and db2-brute scripts to drda-*. Added
  support other DRDA based databases such as IBM Informix Dynamic
  Server and Apache Derby.  [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Added a new function, nsi_set_hostname, to set the intended
  hostname of the target. This allows the use of Server Name
  Indication in SSL connections. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Limits the number of ports that <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/qscan.html">qscan</a> will scan (now up to 8
  open ports and up to 1 closed port by default). These limits can be
  controlled with the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/qscan.html">qscan</a>.numopen and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/qscan.html">qscan</a>.numclosed script
  arguments. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/sslv2.html">sslv2</a>.nse give special output when SSLv2 is supported,
  but no SSLv2 ciphers are offered. This happened with a specific
  Sendmail configuration. [Matt Selsky]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a &quot;times&quot; table to the host table passed to scripts.
  This table contains Nmap&#39;s timing data (srtt, the smoothed round
  trip time; rttvar, the rtt variance; and timeout), all represented
  as floating-point seconds.  The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ipidseq.html">ipidseq</a> and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/qscan.html">qscan</a> scripts were
  updated to utilize the host&#39;s timeout value rather than using a
  conservative guess of 3 seconds for read timeouts. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed the fragmentation options (-f in Nmap, --mtu in Nmap &amp; Nping),
  which were improperly sending whole packets in version
  5.35DC1. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> When receiving raw packets from Pcap, the packet capture time
  is now available to scripts as an additional return value from
  pcap_receive().  It is returned as the floating point number of
  seconds since the epoch.  Also added the nmap.clock() function which
  returns the current time (and convenience functions clock_ms() and
  clock_us()).  Qscan.nse was updated to use this more accurate timing
  data. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat,Nsock]</span> Fixed some minor bugs discovered using the Smatch
  source code analyzer (<a href="http://smatch.sourceforge.net">http://smatch.sourceforge.net</a>/). [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash that would happen after opening the search
  window, entering a relative date criterion such as &quot;after:-7&quot;, and
  then clicking the &quot;Expressions&quot; button. The error message was
<pre>
    AttributeError: &#39;tuple&#39; object has no attribute &#39;strftime&#39;
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  Added a new packet payload--a NAT-PMP external address request for
  port 5351/udp.  Payloads help us elicit responses from listening UDP
  services to better distinguish them from filtered ports.  This
  payload goes well with our new <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nat-pmp-info.html">nat-pmp-info</a> script. [David, Patrik]
</li><li>  Updated IANA IP address space assignment list for random IP (-iR)
  generation. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Ncat now uses case-insensitive string comparison when
  checking authentication schemes and parameters. Florian Roth found a
  server offering &quot;BASIC&quot; instead of &quot;Basic&quot;, and the HTTP RFC
  requires case-insensitive comparisons in most places. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> There is now a limit of 1,000 concurrent running scripts,
  instituted to keep memory under control when there are many open
  ports. Nathan reported 3 GB of memory use (with an out-of-memory NSE
  crash) for one host with tens of thousands of open ports. This limit
  can be controlled with the variable CONCURRENCY_LIMIT in
  nse_main.lua. [David]
</li><li>  The command line in XML output (/nmaprun/@args attribute) now does
  quoting of whitespace using double quotes and backslashes. This
  allows recovering the original command line array even when
  arguments contain whitespace. [David]
</li><li>  Added a service detection probe for master servers of Quake 3 and
  related games.  [Toni Ruottu]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Updated French translation. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed an crash when printing a scan that had no output
  (like a scan made by command-line Nmap). Henri Doreau noticed the
  error. [David]

</li><li>  Performed a major OS detection integration run. The database has
  grown to 2,608 fingerprints (an increase of 262) and many of the
  existing fingerprints were improved. These include the Apple iPad
  and Cisco IOS 15.X devices. We also received many fingerprints for
  ancient Microsoft systems including MS-DOS with MS Networking Client
  3.0, Windows 3.1, and Windows NT 3.1. David posted highlights of his
  integration work at <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/283.">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/283.</a>
</li><li>  Performed a large version detection integration run. The number of
  signatures has grown to 6,622 (an increase of 279). New signatures
  include a remote administrative backdoor that a school famously used
  to spy on its students, an open source digital currency scheme named
  Bitcoin, and game servers for EVE Online, l2emurt Lineage II, and
  Frozen Bubble. You can read David&#39;s highlights at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/385.">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/385.</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-ls.html">nfs-ls</a>.nse, which lists NFS exported files and their
  attributes. The nfs-acls and nfs-dirlist scripts were deleted
  because all their features are supported by this script. [Djalal]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Add new DB2 library and two scripts
<ul><li>db2-brute.nse uses the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html">unpwdb</a> library to guess credentials for DB2
</li><li>db2-info.nse re-write of Tom Sellers script to use the new library</li></ul>
  [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a library for Microsoft SQL Server and 7 new scripts. The new
  scripts are:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-brute.html">ms-sql-brute</a>.nse uses the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html">unpwdb</a> library to guess credentials for MSSQL
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-config.html">ms-sql-config</a> retrieves various configuration details from the server
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-empty-password.html">ms-sql-empty-password</a> checks if the sa account has an empty password
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-hasdbaccess.html">ms-sql-hasdbaccess</a> lists database access per user
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-query.html">ms-sql-query</a> add support for running custom queries against the database
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-tables.html">ms-sql-tables</a> lists databases, tables, columns and datatypes with optional
    keyword filtering
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-xp-cmdshell.html">ms-sql-xp-cmdshell</a> adds support for OS command execution to privileged
    users</li></ul>
  [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-serverinfo.html">afp-serverinfo</a> script that gets a hostname, IP
  addresses, and other configuration information from an AFP server.
  The script, and a patch to the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/afp.html">afp</a> library, were contributed by
  Andrew Orr and subsequently enhanced by Patrik and David.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added additional vulnerability checks to smb-check-vulns.nse:
  The Windows RAS RPC service vulnerability MS06-025
  (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-025.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-025.mspx</a>)
  and the Windows DNS Server RPC vuln MS07-029
  (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-029.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-029.mspx</a>).
  Note that these are only run if you specify the &quot;unsafe&quot; script arg
  because the implemented test crashes vulnerable services. [Drazen]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-cache-snoop.html">dns-cache-snoop</a>.nse by Eugene Alexeev. This script performs
  cache snooping by either sending non-recursive queries or by measuring
  response times.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added the ability to print Nmap output to a
  printer. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nmap, Ncat, Nping]</span> The default unit for time specifications is now
  seconds, not milliseconds, and times may have a decimal point. 1000
  now means 1000 seconds, or about 17 minutes, not 1000 milliseconds.
  Floating point values such as 1.5 are now allowed.  This affects the
  following options:
  Nmap:
<pre>
    --host-timeout
    --max-rtt-timeout --min-rtt-timeout --initial-rtt-timeout
    --scan-delay --max-scan-delay
    --stats-every
</pre>  Ncat:
<pre>
    -d --delay
    -i --idle-timeout
    -w --wait
</pre>  Nping:
<pre>
    --delay
    --host-timeout
    --icmp-orig-time --icmp-recv-time --icmp-trans-time
</pre>  Some sanity checks have been added to catch what looks like an
  attempt to use the old millisecond defaults. For example,
  --host-timeout 10000 yields
<pre>
    Since April 2010, the default unit for --host-timeout is seconds,
    so your time of &quot;10000&quot; is 2.8 hours. If this is what you want,
    use &quot;10000s&quot;.
    QUITTING!
</pre>  You can always disable the warning by giving an explicit unit.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Scripts which take an argument for a time duration can now
  have the duration be a number followed by a unit, like elsewhere in
  Nmap. An example is &quot;10m&quot; for 10 minutes. The units understood are
  &quot;ms&quot; for milliseconds, &quot;s&quot; for seconds, &quot;m&quot; for minutes, and &quot;h&quot; for
  hours.  Seconds are the default if no unit is specified. The new
  function stdnse.parse_timespec does the parsing of these
  formats. The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/qscan.html">qscan</a>.delay script argument, which formerly interpreted
  its argument as being in milliseconds, now defaults to seconds;
  append &quot;ms&quot; to continue using the same numbers. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/irc-unrealircd-backdoor.html">irc-unrealircd-backdoor</a>.nse, which detects a backdoor
  that was in UnrealIRCd source code distributions between November
  2009 and June 2010. See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/826">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/826</a>.
  [Vlatko Kosturjak, Ron, David]
</li><li>  Ports are now considered open during a SYN scan if a SYN packet
  (without the ACK flag) is received in response. This can be due to
  an extremely rare TCP feature known as a simultaneous open or split
  handshake connection. see <a href="http://bit.ly/tcp-sh">http://bit.ly/tcp-sh</a> and
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/723">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/723</a>. [Jah]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> In listen mode, the --exec and --sh-exec options now accept a
  single connection and then exit, just like in normal listen mode.
  Use the --keep-open option to get the old default inetd-like
  behavior. This was suggested by David Millis. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-libopie.html">ftp-libopie</a>.nse by Gutek. This script checks for an
  off-by-one stack overflow vulnerability in libopie by giving the FTP
  service an overly long name. See
  <a href="http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-10:05.opie.asc">http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-10:05.opie.asc</a> for
  details.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ntp-monlist.html">ntp-monlist</a>.nse which discovers NTP server, peer and
  client hosts associated with a scanned target by sending NTPv2
  Private Mode &#39;monitor&#39; and &#39;peers&#39; commands to the target. [Jah]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-php-version.html">http-php-version</a>.nse from Gutek. This script retrieves
  version-specific pages through a couple of magic PHP queries, which
  can identify the PHP version even when a server doesn&#39;t advertise
  it.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> New script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-fuzz.html">dns-fuzz</a> launches a fuzzing attack against DNS
  servers. Added a new category - fuzzer - for scripts like this.
  [Michael Pattrick]
</li><li>  David made many improvements to the NSEDoc for individual scripts,
  including adding @output sections to scripts which didn&#39;t have them.
  He also improved the generated HTML with features like
  auto-generating usage strings if the scripts don&#39;t include their own
  and allowing the giant sidebar lists of scripts/libraries to expand
  and contract.  See <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/.">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/.</a>
</li><li>  UDP payloads are now stored in an external data file, nmap-payloads,
  instead of being hard-coded in the executable. This makes it easier
  to add your own payloads or disable those you find problematic. [Jay
  Fink, David]
</li><li>  The Windows executable installer now uses LZMA compression instead
  of zlib, making it about 15% smaller. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/1011">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/1011</a> for test results. [David]
</li><li>  Open XML elements are now closed in case of a fatal error, so the
  output should at least be well-formed. There are new attributes
  &quot;exit&quot; and &quot;errormsg&quot; in the finished element. &quot;exit&quot; is &quot;success&quot;
  or &quot;error&quot;. When it is &quot;error&quot;, the &quot;errormsg&quot; attribute contains
  the error message. Thanks to Grant Bartlett, who found a typo in the
  new output. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed name resolution in environments where gethostbyname can return
  IPv6 (or other non-IPv4 addresses). In such an environment, Nmap
  would wrongly use the first four bytes of the IPv6 address as an
  IPv4 address. You could force this, at least on Debian, by adding
  the line &quot;options inet6&quot; to /etc/resolv.conf or by running with
  RES_OPTIONS=inet6 in the environment. This was reported by Mats Erik
  Andersson, who also suggested the fix. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed the assignment of interface aliases to directly connected
  routes on Linux, which was broken in 5.30BETA1 (it always assigned
  the base interface instead of the alias). This was visible in the
  host.interface variable passed to NSE scripts. The bug was reported
  Victor Rudnev. [David]
</li><li>  When Nmap is passed a hostname such as google.com which resolves to
  several IP addresses, Nmap now prints each IP address.  It still
  only scans the first one in the returned list. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap now works if you specify several target host names which
  resolve to the same IP address.  This can be useful when you are
  scanning virtual-hosted web servers and want to see NSE results
  specific to each site name even though they reside on the same
  machine. [David]
</li><li>  Made a list of current Nmap SVN committers:
  <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/committers.txt">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/committers.txt</a>
</li><li>  Added a new library, libnetutil, which contains about 2,700 lines of
  networking related code which is now shared between Nmap and Nping
  (it was previously duplicated by each tool). [Luis, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-passwd.html">http-passwd</a>.nse now also checks for boot.ini to support
  Windows targets. [Gutek]
</li><li>  Removed --interactive mode, a miniature shell whose primary purpose
  was to hide command line arguments from the process list. It had
  been broken (would segfault during the second scan) for at least 9
  months and was rarely used. The fact that it was broken was reported
  by Juan Carlos Castro. [David]
</li><li>  Added a version probe, match line, and UDP payload for the
  serialnumberd service of Mac OS X Server. This service overrides
  firewall settings to make itself visible, so it&#39;s useful for host
  discovery. [Patrik]
</li><li>  Improved service detection match lines for:
<ul><li>Oracle Enterprise Manager Agent and mupdate by Matt Selsky
</li><li>Twisted web server, Apple Filing Protocol, Apple Mac OS X Password
    Server, XAVi XG6546p Wireless Gateway, Sun GlassFish
    Communications Server, and Comdasys, SIParator and Glassfish SIP
    by Patrik
</li><li>PostgreSQL, Cisco Site Selector ftpd, and LanSafe UPS monitoring
    HTTPd by Tom Sellers</li></ul>

</li><li>  Improved our brute force password guessing list by mixing in some
  data sent in by Solar Designer of John the Ripper fame.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> IP addresses are now sorted by octet rather than their
  string representation. For example, 10.1.1.2 is now sorted before
  10.1.1.10. This problem was reported by Norris Carden. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added UDP header parsing support to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/packet.html">packet.lua</a>. [jah]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in Libpcap which lead to Nmap hanging forever in some
  cases on 64-bit Mac OS X 10.6, 10.6.1, and 10.6.3.  The fix was
  actually already available in upstream Libpcap, just not released.
  We also had to make Nmap build with its own Libpcap on 64-bit OS X
  if an already-installed system Libpcap has this bug. [David]
</li><li>  Updated our WinPcap to the new 4.1.2 release. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/qscan.html">qscan</a>.nse which gave an error if a confidence
  level of 0.9995 was used.  Thanks to Marcin Hoffmann for noticing
  the problem. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[libpcap]</span> Added a --disable-packet-ring option to force the use of
  an older, slower packet capture mechanism on Linux. Before Linux
  2.6.27, the packet ring mechanism uses different-sized kernel
  structures on 32- and 64-bit architectures, so a 32-bit program will
  not run correctly on a 64-bit kernel. The older mechanism does not
  have this flaw.
</li><li>  Fixed some errors in nmap-os-db, probably caused by incorrect string
  replacement during integration. This patch is from James Cook.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock, Ncat]</span> Nsock has a new function, nsp_setbroadcast, that
  allows setting the SO_BROADCAST option on sockets. Ncat now sets
  this option unconditionally in connect mode to allow connections to
  broadcast addresses (useful in UDP mode). [Daniel Miller]
</li><li>  Nmap now works with &quot;teamed&quot; network interfaces on Windows. In order
  to distinguish the interfaces, their textual descriptions are now
  compared in addition to their MAC addresses. Without this, Nmap
  would send on the wrong interface and not receive any replies. A
  symptom of this problem was all scans failing except when
  --unprivileged was used. Norris Carden reported this bug. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> When receiving a connection/datagram in listen mode, Ncat now
  prints the connecting source port along with the IP address (when
  verbosity is enabled). [Rebellis]
</li><li>  Fixed a problem where the time variable used in some port scanning
  algorithms (for probe timeouts, etc) could vary based on the
  debugging level. [Kris]
</li><li>  Moved the parse_long function from ncat to nbase for better reuse,
  and used it to simplify netmask parsing code. [William Pursell]
</li><li>  Added EPROTO to the list of known error codes in service scan. Daniel
  Miller reported that an EPROTO was causing Nmap to exit after sending
  the Sqlping probe during service scan. The error message was
  &quot;Unexpected error in NSE_TYPE_READ callback. Error code: 71 (Protocol
  error)&quot;. We suspect this was caused by a forged ICMP packet sent by an
  active firewall. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Improved <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-commands.html">smtp-commands</a>.nse to work against more mail servers,
  made it take an <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-commands.html">smtp-commands</a>.domain script argument, and rewrote it
  in the style of other smtp scripts. [Jasey DePriest]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-commands.html">smtp-commands</a> run for the services smtp, smtps,
  submission rather than just smtp.  The other smtp scripts already do
  this. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-recursion.html">dns-recursion</a> script now marks the port as open when it
  gets a response. [Olivier M]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> A big correctness and code cleanliness audit was performed
  which resulted in many bugs being fixed and much more code being
  shared with Nmap rather than duplicated. A structured testing
  script system was also created. [Luis, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Now allows a --count value of zero to run almost
  indefinitely (2^32 rounds). Suggested by Andreas Hubert. [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Fixed --data argument parsing. The value passed was not
  actually making it into outgoing packets. Reported by Tim
  Poth. [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> When a RST packet is received in response to a connection
  attempt in TCP-Connect mode, Nping now properly prints &quot;Connection
  refused&quot; rather than &quot;Operation now in progress&quot;. [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Fixed a bug which caused failure when the first supplied
  target was not resolvable (e.g.: nping bogushost.fkz scanme.insecure.com
  tcpdump.com). [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Fixed some bugs in the BPF filter creation to avoid capture
  and printing of packets Nping sent or which are destined for another
  process. [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Fixed a bug which prevented ARP replies from being displayed
  properly. [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Fixed a bug that caused ICMP Router Advertisement entries to
  be set in host byte order rather than proper network byte
  order. [Luis]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nping]</span> Fixed a segfault caused by bad --data values. [Greg Skoczek]
</li><li>  The Mac OS X installer is now built with MacPorts 1.9.1 rather than
  1.8.2. Among other changes, this fixes a segmentation fault reported
  by some OS X 10.6.3 users.
</li><li>  Nsock now supports an option to remove its Pcap support.  This
  allows the same Nsock to be shared with Nmap (which needs that
  support) and Ncrack (which doesn&#39;t.) Pcap support can be disabled by
  specifying --disable-pcap at configure time on UNIX, or by selecting
  the DebugNoPcap or ReleaseNoPcap configurations in Visual C++ on
  Windows.
</li><li>  Sped up compilation by not building both shared and static libdnet
  libraries--we only use the static one. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Improved error handling and reporting and re-designed communication
  class in RPC library with patch from Djalal Harouni. [Patrik]
</li><li>  Upgraded the included libpcap to version 1.1.1. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Add some special-use IPv4 addresses to isPrivate which are
  described in RFC 5736 and RFC 5737, published in Jan 2010. Improve
  performance of isPrivate for IPv4 addresses by using ip_in_range
  less frequently. Add an extra return value to isPrivate - when the
  first return value is true, the second return value will now be a
  string representing the special use assignment in which the supplied
  address is located. [jah]
</li><li>  Fix compilation on OpenSolaris.  We had to make the libdnet autoconf
  check for PF_PACKET Linux-specific.  Recent versions of OpenSolaris
  support PF_PACKET, but not in a way which is entirely compatible
  with the Linux approach. This problem was reported by Darren Reed. A
  few other minor compatibility changes were made as well. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added script arguments &quot;username&quot; and &quot;password&quot; to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-bounce.html">ftp-bounce</a>
  to override the default anonymous:IEUser@ login combination. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added port number sorting to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-service-discovery.html">dns-service-discovery</a>.nse. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added an snmpWalk() function to the SNMP library and updated
  scripts to use it.  [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed this <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/dns.html">dns.lua</a> error reported by Eugene Alexeev:
  nselib/dns.lua:110: attempt to get length of field &#39;dtype&#39; (a number value)
  [Jah]
</li><li>  Updated nmap-mac-prefixes to the latest IEEE data as of 2010-07-13.
</li><li>  Updated IANA IP address space assignment list for random IP (-iR)
  generation. [Kris]
</li><li>  Created a new directory for storing todo lists for Nmap and related
  projects.  You can see what we&#39;re working on and planning by
  visiting <a href="https://nmap.org/svn/todo/.">https://nmap.org/svn/todo/.</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Removed explicit time limit checking from <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-brute.html">ms-sql-brute</a>,
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pgsql-brute.html">pgsql-brute</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-brute.html">mysql-brute</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-brute.html">ldap-brute</a>, and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-brute.html">afp-brute</a>. The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html">unpwdb</a>
  library does this automatically now. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Correct global access errors in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/afp.html">afp.lua</a> reported by Patrick Donnelly
  [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Correct misspelled &quot;Capabilities.IgnoreSpaceBeforeParanthesis&quot;
  name in the MySQL library. [Kris]
</li><li>  Cleaned up our Winpcap header file directory, and also updated to
  the latest files from the official developer pack
  (WpdPack_4_1_1.zip). [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug which would prevent <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcinfo.html">rpcinfo</a>.nse from returning any
  results for RPC programs which could not be matched to a
  name. [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-anon.html">ftp-anon</a> script is now much smarter about parsing server
  responses and detecting successful (or not) logins.  It now knows
  how to send the ACCT command where appropriate as well. [Rob
  Nicholls]
</li><li>  Normalized a bunch of version detection entries with &quot;webserver&quot; in
  the description.  In most cases this was changed to &quot;httpd&quot;.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed the --crlf option not to insert an extra \r byte in the
  case that one system read ends with \r and the next begins with \n
  (should be rare). [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed bug in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/rpc.html">rpc.lua</a> library that incorrectly required file handles
  to be 32 octets when calling the ReadDir function. The bug was reported by
  Djalal Harouni. [Patrik]

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> New script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-path-vuln.html">afp-path-vuln</a> detects and can exploit a major Mac
  OS X AFP directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2010-0533)
  discovered by Nmap developer Patrik Karlsson. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-path-vuln.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-path-vuln.html</a> and
  <a href="http://bit.ly/nmapafp.">http://bit.ly/nmapafp.</a>
</li><li>  An ALPHA TEST VERSION of Nping, a packet generator written by Luis
  MartinGarcia and Fyodor last summer, is now included in the Nmap
  distribution. While it works, we consider the application unfinished
  and we hope to improve it greatly as a Summer of Code project this
  summer and then do an official release. See <a href="https://nmap.org/nping/.">https://nmap.org/nping/.</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added RPC library and three new NFS scripts. Modified the
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcinfo.html">rpcinfo</a> and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-showmount.html">nfs-showmount</a> scripts to use the new library. The new
  scripts are:
<ul><li>nfs-acls shows the owner and directory mode of NFS exports
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-acls.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-acls.html</a>).
</li><li>nfs-dirlist lists the contents of NFS exports
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-dirlist.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-dirlist.html</a>)
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-statfs.html">nfs-statfs</a> shows file system statistics for NFS exports
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-statfs.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-statfs.html</a>).</li></ul>
  [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the new <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-service-discovery.html">dns-service-discovery</a> script which uses DNS-SD
  to identify services. DNS-SD is one part of automatic configuration
  technologies known by names such as Bonjour, Rendezvous, and
  Zeroconf. This one script can provide as much information as a full
  port scan in some cases. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-service-discovery.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-service-discovery.html</a> . [Patrik
  Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> New script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-brute.html">afp-brute</a> for brute force authentication attempts
  against the Apple AFP filesharing protocol. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-brute.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-brute.html</a> . [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-showmount.html">afp-showmount</a> which displays Apple AFP
  shares and their permissions.  See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-showmount.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-showmount.html</a> . [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/qscan.html">qscan</a> script to repeatedly probe ports on a host to
  gather round-trip times for each port. The script then uses these
  times to group together ports with statistically equivalent round
  trip times.  Ports in different groups could be the result of things
  such as port forwarding to hosts behind a NAT. It is based on work
  by Doug Hoyte. This script also utilizes the new NSE raw IP sending
  functionality. See <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/qscan.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/qscan.html</a> . [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new script, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/db2-das-info.html">db2-das-info</a>.nse, that connects to the IBM
  DB2 Administration Server (DAS) exports the server profile. No
  authentication is required for this request. The script will also
  set the port product and version if a version scan is requested. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/db2-das-info.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/db2-das-info.html</a> . [Patrik Karlsson,
  Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new library for ASN.1 parsing and adapted the SNMP
  library to make use of it. Added 5 SNMP scripts that use the new
  libraries:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-netstat.html">snmp-netstat</a> shows listening and connected
    sockets (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-netstat.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-netstat.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-processes.html">snmp-processes</a> shows process information including name, pid, path
    &amp; parameters (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-processes.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-processes.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-services.html">snmp-win32-services</a> shows the names of running Windows services
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-services.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-services.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-shares.html">snmp-win32-shares</a> shows the names and path of Windows shares
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-shares.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-shares.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-software.html">snmp-win32-software</a> shows a list of installed Windows software
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-software.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-software.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-users.html">snmp-win32-users</a> shows a list of local Windows users
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-users.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-win32-users.html</a>).</li></ul>
  [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-interfaces.html">snmp-interfaces</a> script by Thomas Buchanan, which
  enumerates network interfaces over SNMP. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-interfaces.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-interfaces.html</a> .
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-vmware-path-vuln.html">http-vmware-path-vuln</a>.nse, which checks for a critical
  and easy to exploit path-traversal vulnerability in VMWare
  (CVE-2009-3733). See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-vmware-path-vuln.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-vmware-path-vuln.html</a> . [Ron]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new library for LDAP and three new scripts by Patrik:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-brute.html">ldap-brute</a> uses the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html">unpwdb</a> library to guess credentials for LDAP
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-brute.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-brute.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-rootdse.html">ldap-rootdse</a> retrieves the LDAP root DSA-specific Entry (DSE)
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-rootdse.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-rootdse.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-search.html">ldap-search</a> queries a LDAP directory for either
    all, or a number of pre-defined object types
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-search.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ldap-search.html</a>).</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new library for PostgreSQL and the script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pgsql-brute.html">pgsql-brute</a>
  that uses it to guess credentials. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pgsql-brute.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pgsql-brute.html</a> . [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added 5 new MySQL NSE scripts and a MySQL library by Patrik Karlsson:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-brute.html">mysql-brute</a> uses the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html">unpwdb</a> library to guess credentials for MySQL
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-brute.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-brute.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-databases.html">mysql-databases</a> queries MySQL for a list of databases
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-databases.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-databases.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-empty-password.html">mysql-empty-password</a> attempts to authenticate anonymously or as
    root with an empty password
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-empty-password.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-empty-password.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-users.html">mysql-users</a> queries MySQL for a list of database users
    (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-users.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-users.html</a>).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-variables.html">mysql-variables</a> queries MySQL for its variables and their
    settings (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-variables.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-variables.html</a>).</li></ul>

</li><li>  Improved the passwords.lst database used by NSE by combining several
  leaked password databases collected by Ron Bowes. The size of the
  database has been increased from 200 to 5000.
</li><li>  Zenmap&#39;s &quot;slow comprehensive scan profile&quot; has been modified to use
  the best 7-probe host discovery combination we were able to find in
  extensive empirical testing
  (<a href="http://www.bamsoftware.com/wiki/nmap/EffectivenessOfPingProbes">http://www.bamsoftware.com/wiki/nmap/EffectivenessOfPingProbes</a>).
  That combination is &quot;-PE -PP -PS21,22,23,25,80,113,31339
  -PA80,113,443,10042 -PO&quot;. [David]
</li><li>  Switched to -Pn and -sn and as the preferred syntax for skipping
  ping scan and skipping port scan, respectively. Previously the -PN
  and -sP options were recommended. This establishes a more regular
  syntax for some options that disable phases of a scan:
<ul><li>-n  no reverse DNS
</li><li>-Pn no host discovery
</li><li>-sn no port scan</li></ul>
  We also felt that the old -sP (&quot;ping scan&quot;) option was a bit
  misleading because current versions of Nmap can go much further
  (including -sC and --traceroute) even with port scans disabled. We
  will retain support for the previous option names for the foreseeable
  future.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ipidseq.html">ipidseq</a> script to classify a host&#39;s IP ID sequence
  numbers in the same way Nmap does.  This can be used to test hosts&#39;
  suitability for Nmap&#39;s Idle Scan (-sI), i.e. check if a host is an
  idle zombie.  This is the first script to use the new raw IP sending
  functionality in NSE. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ipidseq.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ipidseq.html</a> . [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html">ssl-enum-ciphers</a> script by Mak Kolybabi. It lists
  the ciphers and compressors supported by SSL/TLS servers. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html</a> .
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added two new scripts for the MongoDB database from Martin
  Holst Swende. <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mongodb-info.html">mongodb-info</a>
  (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mongodb-info.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mongodb-info.html</a>) gets information
  like the version number, memory use, and operating system, while
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mongodb-databases.html">mongodb-databases</a>
  (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mongodb-databases.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mongodb-databases.html</a>) lists the
  databases and their size on disk.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the scripts <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/couchdb-databases.html">couchdb-databases</a> and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/couchdb-stats.html">couchdb-stats</a>, which
  list CouchDB databases and show access statistics, and a new
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/json.html">json.lua</a> library they depend on. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/couchdb-databases.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/couchdb-databases.html</a> and
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/couchdb-stats.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/couchdb-stats.html</a> [Martin Holst
  Swende]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the new <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/lexmark-config.html">lexmark-config</a> script that lists product
  information and configuration for Lexmark printers. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/lexmark-config.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/lexmark-config.html</a> . [Patrik
  Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the new <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/daap-get-library.html">daap-get-library</a> script which uses the Digital
  Audio Access Protocol to enumerate the contents of a library. The
  contents contain the name of the artist, album and song. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/daap-get-library.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/daap-get-library.html</a> . [Patrik]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/jdwp-version.html">jdwp-version</a>.nse, a script by Michael Schierl that finds
  the version of a Java Debug Wire Protocol server. This is a
  dangerous service to find running as it does not provide any
  security against malicious attackers who can inject their own
  bytecode into the debugged process. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/jdwp-version.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/jdwp-version.html</a> .
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-enum-users.html">smtp-enum-users</a> script from Duarte Silva, which
  attempts to find user account names over SMTP by brute force testing
  using RCPT, VRFY, and EXPN tests.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html">unpwdb</a> library now has a default time limit on the
  usernames and passwords iterators. This will prevent brute force
  scripts from running for a long time when a service is slow. These
  new script arguments control the limits:
<ul><li>unpwdb.userlimit  Limit on number of usernames.
</li><li>unpwdb.passlimit  Limit on number of passwords.
</li><li>unpwdb.timelimit  Time limit in seconds.</li></ul>
  Pass 0 for any of these limits to disable it. For more details, see
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html</a> . [David]
</li><li>  When --open is used, Nmap no longer prints output for hosts which
  don&#39;t have any open ports. All output formats are treated the same
  way, so if a host isn&#39;t shown in normal output, it won&#39;t be shown in
  XML output either.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-methods.html">http-methods</a> from Bernd Stroessenreuther.
  This script sends an HTTP OPTIONS request to get the methods
  supported by the server, highlights potentially risky methods, and
  optionally tests each method to see if they are restricted by IP
  address or something similar. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-methods.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-methods.html</a> .
</li><li>  The -v and -d options are now handled in the same way. These three
  forms are equivalent:
<pre>
    -v -v -v    -vvv    -v3
    -d -d -d    -ddd    -d3
</pre>  Formerly, the -ddd and -v3 forms didn&#39;t work. Mak Kolybabi submitted
  a patch.
</li><li>  Fixed a libpcap compilation error on Solaris. This was actually
  fixed in libpcap&#39;s source control back in 2008, but they haven&#39;t made
  a release since then :(. They still seem to be actively developing
  though, so let&#39;s hope for a release soon. Solaris compilation fixes
  were made to Ncat and Nping as well.
</li><li>  Zenmap now lets you save scan results in normal Nmap text output
  format or (as before) as XML. The XML format still has the text
  version embedded inside it, and is still the only format Zenmap can
  load again. The &quot;Save to Directory&quot; mode for saving multiple
  aggregated scans at once still always saves XML results. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed the packaging of x64 versions of WinPcap drivers in the
  winpcap-nmap installer to ensure that 64-bit applications (such as
  64-bit Wireshark) work properly. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  Fixed the Idle Scan (-sI) so that scanning multiple hosts doesn&#39;t
  retest the zombie proxy and reinitialize all of the associated data
  at the beginning of each run. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Raw packet sending at the IP layer is now supported, in
  addition to the existing Ethernet sending functionality.  Packets to
  send start with an IPv4 header and can be sent to arbitrary
  hosts. For details, see
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html#nse-api-networkio-raw">https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html#nse-api-networkio-raw</a> [Kris]
</li><li>  Added version detection match line for the Arucer backdoor, which was
  found packaged with drivers for the Energizer USB recharger product
  (see <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/154421">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/154421</a>). [Ron]
</li><li>  Fixed --resume to work again despite our recent changes to the Nmap
  output format. [jlanthea]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Localized most of the remaining strings in the GUI
  interface which were English-only. The actual textual Nmap results
  are still in English since Nmap, but the GUI is now almost fully
  localized. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Updated the localization files for the French
  translation. [Gutek]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed an interface bug which could cause hostnames with
  underscores like &quot;host_a&quot; to be rendered like &quot;hosta&quot; with the &quot;a&quot;
  underlined. Thanks to Toralf F. for the report, and David for the
  fix.
</li><li>  Nmap now honors routing table entries that override interface
  addresses and netmasks. For example, with this configuration:
<pre>
    ************************INTERFACES************************
    DEV  (SHORT) IP/MASK         TYPE     UP MAC
    eth0 (eth0)  192.168.0.21/24 ethernet up 00:00:00:00:00:00
    .
    **************************ROUTES**************************
    DST/MASK       DEV  GATEWAY
    192.168.0.3/32 eth0 192.168.0.1
    192.168.0.0/24 eth0
</pre>  Nmap will not consider 192.168.0.3 directly connected through eth0,
  even though it matches the interface&#39;s netmask. It won&#39;t try to ARP
  ping 192.168.0.3, but will route traffic through 192.168.0.1.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The HTTP proxy server now accepts client connections over
  SSL. That means connections to the proxy can be encrypted and
  authenticated. We haven&#39;t found any HTTP clients that directly
  support SSL connections to proxies, but you can use Ncat as a tunnel
  to an SSL-supporting Ncat proxy. This new feature was implemented by
  Markus Klinik.
</li><li>  Updated our Mac OS X build system so that our binary packages are
  built on Mac OS X 10.6 rather than 10.5. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed reading of the interface table on NetBSD. Running nmap
  --iflist would report &quot;INTERFACES: NONE FOUND(!)&quot; and any scan done
  as root would fail with &quot;WARNING: Unable to find appropriate
  interface for system route to...&quot;. This was first reported by Jay
  Fink, and had already been patched in the NetBSD pkgsrc
  tree. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in traceroute that could happen when directly connected
  and routed targets were in the same hostgroup. If the first target
  was directly connected, the traceroute for all targets in the group
  would have a trace of one hop.
</li><li>  ARP requests now work with libpcap Linux &quot;cooked&quot; encapsulation.
  According to <a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/SLL">http://wiki.wireshark.org/SLL</a>, this encapsulation is
  used on devices &quot;where the native link layer header isn&#39;t available
  or can&#39;t be used.&quot; Before this, attempting any ARP operation on such
  an interface would fail with the error
<pre>
    read_arp_reply_pcap called on interfaces that is datatype 113
      rather than DLT_EN10MB (1)
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  Fixed the display of route netmask bits in --iflist on little-endian
  architectures. Formerly, any mask less than /24 was shown as /0, and
  other masks were also wrong. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed an assertion failure which could occur when connecting to an
  SSL server:
<pre>
    nsock_core.c:199: socket_count_write_dec: Assertion `(iod-&gt;writesd_count)
</pre>&gt; 0&#39; failed.
  This was observed when running the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> script but could
  possibly have happened in other situations. Thanks to Brandon for
  reporting the bug and testing. [David]
</li><li>  Added the function bignum_add to the nse_openssl library to support
  BIGNUM addition [Patrik]
</li><li>  The redistributable Visual C++ runtime components installer
  (vcredist_x86.exe) has been upgraded to version 9.0.30729.4148. Axel
  Pettinger reported that the previous version 9.0.30729.17, caused a
  Windows Update on Windows 7 because of Microsoft security advisory
  MS09-035.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed an error that could make programs run with --exec exit
  prematurely on Windows. The problem was related to a program writing
  too quickly into a non-blocking socket. A symptom was the message:
<pre>
    NCAT DEBUG: Subprocess ended with exit code 259.
</pre>  Reported by David Millis. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed a bug that prevented detection of EOF from stdin on
  Windows. Reported by Adrian Crenshaw and Andy Zwirko. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> WSAEACCES was added to the list of known connect error
  codes. This error can happen on Windows when a port is blocked by
  Windows Firewall. Thanks to Taemun for reporting this and
  investigating.
</li><li>  XML output now only includes host elements for down hosts in verbose
  mode. This makes it consistent with the other output formats.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> so it uses the full path name for the
  fingerprints file. This prevents it from quitting with an error like
  this:
<pre>
    NSE: <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a>: Attempting to parse fingerprint file
    nselib/data/http-fingerprints NSE: <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> against
    10.99.24.140:443 threw an error! C:\Program
    Files\Nmap\scripts\<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a>.nse:198: bad argument #1 to &#39;lines&#39;
    (nselib/data/http-fingerprints: No such file or directory) stack
    traceback:
</pre>  [Kris, Brandon, Ron Meldau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a missing dirname function to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html">http-favicon</a>. Its absence
  was causing this error message when a web page specified a relative
  icon URL in a link element:
<pre>
   <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html">http-favicon</a>.nse:141: variable &#39;dirname&#39; is not declared
</pre>  [David, Ron Meldau]
</li><li>  Fixed the parsing of libdnet DLPI interface names that contain more
  than one string of digits. Joe Dietz reported that an interface with
  the name e1000g0 was causing this error message on Solaris 9:
<pre>
    Warning: Unable to open interface e1000g0 -- skipping it.
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the function nmap.is_privileged() to tell a script if,
  as far as Nmap&#39;s concerned, it can do privileged operations. For
  instance, this can be used to determine whether a script can open a
  raw socket or Ethernet interface. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the function nmap.get_ports() so scripts can iterate
  over a host&#39;s port table entries matching a given protocol and
  state. [Kris, Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed a handle leak with --exec and --sh-exec on Windows,
  found by Jon Greaves. One thread handle was being leaked per child
  process invocation. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nbstat.html">nbstat</a>.nse can now look up the MAC prefix vendor string. Other
  scripts can now do the same thing using the
  datafiles.parse_mac_prefixes function. [Thomas Buchanan]
</li><li>  Remove the PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME variables from the environment
  before executing a sub-ndiff if they exist and if Zenmap is running
  in a py2app bundle. These variables are set by py2app to point
  inside our application bundle. Having them set in the environment
  makes Ndiff use the same settings because it is also a Python
  application. Deleting the variables is somewhat wrong, because the
  user may have set those outside of Zenmap expecting them to be used
  with their system-installed Python programs. But this is at least no
  worse than before our build system update, because previously py2app
  was stomping on the variables anyway. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed a segmentation fault caused by access to freed memory.
  It could be triggered by making multiple connections to a server
  that was constantly sending in SSL mode, such as:
<pre>
    ncat -l -k --ssl &lt; /dev/zero
</pre>  This bug was reported by Mak Kolybabi. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Moved the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-open-relay.html">smtp-open-relay</a>.nse script out of the &quot;demo&quot;
  category after improvements by Duarte Silva. We have now met the
  goal of removing all scripts from that category.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug which prevented <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-brute.html">smb-brute</a> from properly detecting
  account lockouts, which could lead to lockouts of many accounts on
  the target machine. Now <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-brute.html">smb-brute</a> tries to check the lockout policy
  before starting and refuses to run (unless you force it to with the
  smblockout variable) if lockouts are enabled or if it locks out an
  account. [Ron]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Rewrote <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-domains.html">smb-enum-domains</a> to be more generalized and rely on
  library functions which will eventually be shared with
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-brute.html">smb-brute</a>. [Ron]
</li><li>  Qualified an assertion to allow zero-byte sends in Nsock. Without
  this, an NSE script could cause this assertion failure by doing
  socket:send(&quot;&quot;):
<pre>
    nmap: nsock_core.c:516: handle_write_result: Assertion `bytesleft &gt; 0&#39; failed.
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  Added a service probe for Logitech SqueezeCenter command line interface
  [Patrik]
</li><li>  Improved PostgreSQL match lines by matching the line of the error to a
  specific version [Patrik].
</li><li>  Added a mac_addr_next_hop member to the host tables used in NSE for
  scripts which need to know the MAC address of the next hop router
  for reaching a target host. [Michael Pattrick, KX].
</li><li>  Removed the nmap_service.exe helper program for <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-psexec.html">smb-psexec</a>, as it
  was still being flagged by malware detection even after the
  bit-flipping in the next release. In fact, the obfuscation backfired
  and caused more false positives! You can now download it from
  <a href="https://nmap.org/psexec/nmap_service.exe">https://nmap.org/psexec/nmap_service.exe</a>. (The script will remind you
  if you run the script and it&#39;s not installed.)
</li><li>  Added service probes and UDP payloads for games based on the Quake 2
  and Quake 3 engine, submitted by Mak Kolybabi.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Added support for HTTP digest authentication of proxies, as
  both client and server. Previously only the less secure basic
  authentication method was supported. [Venkat, David]
</li><li>  Improved the MIT Kerberos version detection signatures. [Matt Selsky]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> Show a nicer error message when an input file can&#39;t be
  loaded. Suggested by Derril Lucci, who also contributed a patch.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new library <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/afp.html">afp.lua</a> which handles the Apple Filing
  Protocol (AFP) filesharing system. The library handles
  authentication and many other protocol features, and enables the new
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-path-vuln.html">afp-path-vuln</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-brute.html">afp-brute</a>, and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-showmount.html">afp-showmount</a> scripts. [Patrik]
</li><li>  Added an Apple Filing Protocol service probe that detects Netatalk
  servers. (Apple&#39;s AFP servers are coincidentally triggered by the
  SSLSessionReq probe.) [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/packet.html">packet.lua</a> so that functions used to set packet header
  fields (e.g. ip_set_ttl) also set the appropriate variables used to
  access the data (e.g. ip_ttl). [Kris]
</li><li>  Updated and corrected IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)
  generation.  Now even 001/8 has been allocated. [Kris]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 5.21 [2010-01-27] <a class="versionlink" id="5.21" href="#5.21" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added a workaround for a Ubuntu Python packaging idiosyncrasy.
  As of version python2.6-2.6.4-0ubuntu3, Ubuntu&#39;s distutils modifies
  self.prefix, a variable we use in the setup.py script. This would
  cause Zenmap to look in the wrong place for its configuration files,
  and show the dialog &quot;Error creating the per-user configuration
  directory&quot; with the specific error &quot;[Errno 2] No such file or
  directory: &#39;/usr/share/zenmap/config&#39;&quot;. This problem was reported by
  Chris Clements, who also helped debug. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed an error that occurred when UDP scan was combined with version
  scan. UDP ports would appear in the state &quot;unknown&quot; at the end of
  the scan, and in some cases an assertion failure would be raised.
  This was an unintended side effect of the memory use reduction
  changes in 5.20. The bug was reported by Jon Kibler. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Did some simple bit-flipping on the nmap_service.exe program
  used by the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-psexec.html">smb-psexec</a> script, to avoid its being falsely detected
  as malware. [Ron]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http.lua</a> that could lead to an assertion
  failure. It happened when there was an error getting the a response
  at the beginning of a batch in http.pipeline. The symptoms of the
  bug were:
<pre>
    NSE: Received only 0 of 1 expected reponses.
    Decreasing max pipelined requests to 0.
    NSOCK (0.1870s) Write request for 0 bytes...
    nmap: nsock_core.c:516: handle_write_result: Assertion `bytesleft &gt; 0&#39; failed.
</pre>  The error was reported by Brandon Enright and pyllyukko.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Restored the ability of http.head to return a body if the
  server returns one. This was lost in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http.lua</a> overhaul from
  5.20. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed the use of our <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/strict.html">strict.lua</a> library on distributions that
  install their own <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/strict.html">strict.lua</a>. The error message was
<pre>
    nse_main.lua:97: attempt to call a boolean value
</pre>  It was reported by Onur K. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Fixed handing of nameserver entries in /etc/resolv.conf so it could
  handle entries containing more than 16 bytes, which can occur with
  IPv6 addresses.  Gunnar Lindberg reported the problem and
  contributed an initial patch, then Brandon and Kris refined and
  implemented it.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Corrected a behavior change in http.request that was
  accidentally made in 5.20: it could return nil instead of a table
  indicating failure. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed the use of an undefined variable in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-sessions.html">smb-enum-sessions</a>,
  reported by Brandon. [Ron]
</li><li>  Fixed a compiler error when --without-liblua is used. [Brandon]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed an error with running <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a>.nse along with the
  --datadir option. The script would report the error
<pre>
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a>.nse:198: bad argument #1 to &#39;lines&#39;
      (nselib/data/http-fingerprints: No such file or directory)
</pre>  The error was reported by Ron Meldau and Brandon. [Kris]
</li><li>  Added a function that was missing from <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html">http-favicon</a>.nse. Its absence
  would cause the error
<pre>
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html">http-favicon</a>.nse:141: variable &#39;dirname&#39; is not declared
</pre>  when a web page specified an relative icon URL through the link
  element. This bug was reported by Ron Meldau. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug with the decoding of NMAP OID component values greater
  than 127. [Patrik Karlsson, David]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 5.20 [2010-01-20] <a class="versionlink" id="5.20" href="#5.20" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Dramatically improved the version detection database, integrating
  2,596 submissions that users contributed since February 3, 2009!
  More than a thousand signatures were added, bringing the total to
  8,501. Many existing signatures were improved as well. Please keep
  those submissions and corrections coming! Nmap prints a submission
  URL and fingerprint when it receives responses it can&#39;t yet
  interpret.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new script, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/oracle-sid-brute.html">oracle-sid-brute</a>, which queries the Oracle
  TNS-listener for default instance/sid names. The SID enumeration
  list was prepared by Red Database security. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/oracle-sid-brute.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/oracle-sid-brute.html</a> . [Patrik
  Karlsson]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The --ssl, --output, and --hex-dump options now work with
  --exec and --sh-exec. Among other things, this allows you to make a
  program&#39;s I/O available over the network wrapped in SSL encryption
  for security.  It is implemented by forking a separate process to
  handle network communications and relay the data to the
  sub-process. [Venkat, David]
</li><li>  Nmap now tries start the WinPcap NPF service on Windows if it is not
  already running. This is rare, since our WinPcap installer starts
  NPF running at system boot time by default. Because starting NPF
  requires administrator privileges, a UAC dialog for net.exe may
  appear on Windows Vista and Windows 7 before NPF is loaded.  Once
  NPF is loaded, it generally stays loaded until you reboot or run
  &quot;net stop npf&quot;. [David, Michael Pattrick]
</li><li>  The Nmap Windows installer and our WinPcap installer now have an
  option /NPFSTARTUP=NO, which inhibits the installer from setting the
  WinPcap NPF service to start at system startup and at install-time.
  This option only affects silent mode (/S) because existing GUI
  checkboxes allow you to configure this behavior during interactive
  installation. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Replaced our runlevel system for managing the order of script
  execution with a much more powerful dependency system. This allows
  scripts to specify which other scripts they depend on (e.g. a brute
  force authentication script might depend on username enumeration
  scripts) and NSE manages the order. Dependencies only enforce
  ordering, they cannot pull in scripts which the user didn&#39;t
  specify. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-script-format.html#nse-format-dependencies">https://nmap.org/book/nse-script-format.html#nse-format-dependencies</a>
  [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> For compatibility with Hobbit&#39;s original Netcat, The -p
  option now works to set the listening port number in listen mode.
  So &quot;ncat -l 123&quot; can now be expressed as &quot;ncat -l -p 123&quot;
  too. [David]
</li><li>  A new script argument, http.useragent, lets you modify
  the User-Agent header sent by NSE from its default of &quot;Mozilla/5.0
  (compatible; Nmap Scripting Engine; <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse.html">https://nmap.org/book/nse.html</a>)&quot;.
  Set it to the empty string to disable the User-Agent
  entirely. [David, Tom Sellers, Jah]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The locale setting had been taken from the Windows locale,
  which inadvertently made setting the locale with the LANG
  environment variable stop working. Now the LANG variable is examined
  first, and if that is not present, the system-wide setting is
  used. This change allows users to keep Zenmap in its original
  English (or any of Zenmap&#39;s other languages) even if their system is
  set to use a different locale.  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html">http-favicon</a> script is now better at finding &quot;link
  rel=icon&quot; tags in pages, and uses that icon in preference to
  /favicon.ico if found. If the favicon.uri script arg is given, only
  that is tried.  Meanwhile, a giant (10 million web servers) favicon
  scan by Brandon allowed us to add about 40 more of the most popular
  icons to the DB. [David, Brandon]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-psexec.html">smb-psexec</a> now works against Windows XP (as well as
  already-supported Win2K and Windows 2003). The solution involved
  changing the seemingly irrelevant PID field in the SMB packet. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/13">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/13</a>. [Ron]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a bug which kept the nselib/data/psexec subdirectory out
  of the Windows packages. We needed to add the /s and /e options to
  xcopy in our Visual C++ project file. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Overhauled our <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http</a> library to centralize HTTP parsing and
  make it more robust. The biggest user-visible change is that
  http.request goes back to returning a parsed result table rather than raw
  HTTP data. Also the http.pipeline function no longer accepts the
  no-longer-used &quot;raw&quot; option. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in traceroute that could lead to a crash:
<pre>
    terminate called after throwing an instance of &#39;std::out_of_range&#39;
      what():  bitset::test
</pre>  It happened when the preliminary distance guess for a target was
  greater than 30, the size of an internal data structure. David and
  Brandon tracked down the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed compilation of libdnet-stripped on platforms that don&#39;t have
  socklen_t. [Michael Pattrick]
</li><li>  Added a service probe and match lines for the Logitech/SlimDevices
  SqueezeCenter music server. [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  Fixed the RTSPRequest version probe, which was accidentally modified
  to say &quot;RTSP/2.0&quot; rather than &quot;RTSP/1.0&quot; in 5.10BETA2. [Matt Selsky]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Our <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http</a> library no longer allows cached responses from a GET
  request to be returned for a HEAD request. This could cause problems
  with at least the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> script. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in the WinPcap installer: If the &quot;Start the WinPcap
  service &#39;NPF&#39; at startup&quot; box was unchecked and the &quot;Start the
  WinPcap service &#39;NPF&#39; now&quot; box was checked, the second checkbox
  would be ignored (the service would not be started now). [Rob
  Nicholls]

<li>  Added 7 new NSE scripts for a grand total of 79! You can learn about
  them all at <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc">https://nmap.org/nsedoc</a>/.  Here are the new ones:
<ul>
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-showmount.html">nfs-showmount</a> displays NFS exports like &quot;showmount -e&quot; does. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-showmount.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-showmount.html</a> . [Patrik
    Karlsson]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ntp-info.html">ntp-info</a> prints the time and configuration variables provided by
    an NTP service. It may get such interesting information as the
    operating system, server build date, and upstream time server IP
    address. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ntp-info.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ntp-info.html</a> . [Richard Sammet]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/citrix-brute-xml.html">citrix-brute-xml</a> uses the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/unpwdb.html">unpwdb</a> library to guess credentials for
    the Citrix PN Web Agent Service. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/citrix-brute-xml.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/citrix-brute-xml.html</a> . [Patrik Karlsson]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/citrix-enum-apps.html">citrix-enum-apps</a> and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/citrix-enum-apps-xml.html">citrix-enum-apps-xml</a> print a list of published

    Karlsson]
</ul>
</li><li>  We performed a memory consumption audit and made changes to
  dramatically reduce Nmap&#39;s footprint.  This improves performance on
  all systems, but is particularly important when running Nmap on
  small embedded devices such as phones.  Our intensive UDP scan
  benchmark saw peak memory usage decrease from 34MB to 6MB, while OS
  detection consumption was reduced from 67MB to 3MB.  Read about the
  changes at <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/663">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/663</a>.  Here are the
  highlights:
<ul>
<li>    The size of the internal representation of nmap-os-db was reduced
    more than 90%. Peak memory consumption in our OS detection
    benchmark was reduced from 67MB to 3MB. [David]
<li>    The size of individual Port structures without service scan
    results was reduced about 70%. [Pavel Kankovsky]
<li>    When a port receives no response, Nmap now avoids allocating a
    Port structure at all, so scans against filtered hosts can be
    light on memory. [David]
</ul>
</li><li>  David started a major service detection submission integration
  run. So far he has processed submissions since February for the
  following services: imap, pop3, afp, sip, printer, transmission,
  svnserve, vmware, domain, backdoor, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/finger.html">finger</a>, freeciv, hp, imaps, irc,
  landesk, netbios-ssn, netsupport, nntp, oracle, radmin, routersetup,
  rtorrent, serv-u, shoutcast, ssh, tcpmux, torrent, utorrent, vnc and
  ipp. The rest will come in the next release, along with full stats
  on the additions.
</li><li>  Added service detection probe for Kerberos (udp/88) and IBM DB2
  DAS (523/UDP). [Patrik Karlsson]
</li><li>  Added a UDP payload and service detection probe for Citrix
  MetaFrame, which typically runs on 1604/udp. [Thomas Buchanan]
</li><li>  Added a UDP SIPOptions service detection probe corresponding to the
  TCP one. [Patrik Karlsson, Matt Selsky, David Fifield]
</li><li>  Updated service detection signatures for Microsoft SQL Server 2005
  to detect recent Microsoft security update (MS09-062), and also
  updated <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ms-sql-info.html">ms-sql-info</a>.nse to support MS SQL Server 2008
  detection. [Tom]
</li><li>  Nmap now provides Christmas greetings and a reminder of Xmas scan
  (-sX) when run in verbose mode on December 25. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Removed a limitation of <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/snmp.html">snmp.lua</a> which only allowed it to properly
  encode OID component values up to 127. The bug was reported by
  Victor Rudnev. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap script output now uses two spaces of indention rather than
  three for the first level. This better aligns with the standard set by
  the stdnse.format_output function added in the last release. Output
  now looks like:
  8082/tcp open  http        Apache httpd 2.2.13 ((Fedora))
  |_http-favicon: Apache Web Server (seen on SuSE, Linux Tux favicon)

  |_smbv2-enabled: Server doesn&#39;t support SMBv2 protocol
  [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed (we hope) a deadlock we were seeing when doing a
  favicon.nse survey against millions of hosts. We now restore all
  threads that are waiting on a socket lock when a thread relinquishes
  its lock. We expect only one of them to be able to grab the newly
  freed lock, and the rest to go back to waiting. [David, Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash when filtering with inroute: in scans without
  traceroute data. (KeyError: &#39;hops&#39;) [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Use a looser match pattern in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/auth-owners.html">auth-owners</a>.nse for retrieving
  the owner out of an identd response. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/549">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/549</a>. [Richard Sammet]
</li><li>  Improved some Cyrus pop3 and Polycom SoundStation sip match
  lines. [Matt Selsky]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> In the Windows version of netrun, we weren&#39;t noticing when a
  command fails to be executed (when CreateProcess fails). We now see
  the return value and close the socket to disconnect the
  client. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Updated <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-iis-webdav-vuln.html">http-iis-webdav-vuln</a> to run against SSL-enabled
  servers [Ron]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Improved db2-info to set port product and state (rather than
  just port.version.name and confidence) when a DB2 service is
  positively identified. Error reporting was improved as well. [Tom]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 5.10BETA1 [2009-11-23] <a class="versionlink" id="5.10BETA1" href="#5.10BETA1" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Added 14 new NSE scripts for a grand total of 72! You can learn
  about them all at <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc">https://nmap.org/nsedoc</a>/. Here are the new ones:
<ul>
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-psexec.html">smb-psexec</a> implements remote process execution similar to the
    Sysinternals&#39; psexec tool (or Metasploit&#39;s psexec &quot;exploit&quot;),
    allowing a user to run a series of programs on a remote machine
    and read the output. This is great for gathering information about
    servers, running the same tool on a range of system, or even
    installing a backdoor on a collection of computers. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-psexec.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-psexec.html</a> [Ron]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dhcp-discover.html">dhcp-discover</a> sends out DHCP probes on UDP/67 and displays all
    interesting results (or, with verbosity, all results).
    Optionally, multiple probes can be sent and the MAC address can be
    randomized in an attempt to exhaust the DHCP server&#39;s address pool
    and potentially create a denial of service condition. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dhcp-discover.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dhcp-discover.html</a> . [Ron]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> enumerates URLs used by popular web applications and
    servers and reports which ones exist on a target web server. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html</a> . [Ron, Andrew Orr,
    Rob Nicholls]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a> retrieves and prints a target server&#39;s SSL
    certificate. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html</a> . [David]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/x11-access.html">x11-access</a> checks whether access to an X11 server is allowed (as
    with &quot;xhost +&quot; for example). See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/x11-access.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/x11-access.html</a> . [jlanthea]
<li>    db2-info enhances DB2 database instance detection. It provides
    detection when version probes fail, but will default to the
    version detection probe value if that is more precise. It also
    detects the server platform and database instance name. The DB2
    version detection port ranges were broadened to 50000-50025 and
    60000-60025 as well. [Tom]
<li>    smbv2-enabled checks if the smbv2 protocol is enabled on target
    servers. SMBv2 has already suffered from at least one major
    security vulnerability. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smbv2-enabled.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smbv2-enabled.html</a> . [Ron]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html">http-favicon</a> obtains the favicon file (/favicon.ico or whatever is
    specified by the HTML link tag) and tries to identify its source
    (such as a certain web application) using a database lookup. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html</a> . [Vladz]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-date.html">http-date</a> obtains the Date: header field value from an HTTP server
    then displays it along with how much it differs from local
    time. See <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-date.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-date.html</a> . [David]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-userdir-enum.html">http-userdir-enum</a> attempts to enumerate users on a system by
    trying URLs with common usernames in the Apache mod_userdir format
    (e.g. <a href="http://target-server.com">http://target-server.com</a>/~john). See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-userdir-enum.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-userdir-enum.html</a> . [Jah]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pjl-ready-message.html">pjl-ready-message</a> allows viewing and setting the status message on
    printers which support the Printer Job Language (many HP printers
    do). See <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pjl-ready-message.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pjl-ready-message.html</a> .
    [Aaron Leininger]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-headers.html">http-headers</a> performs a GET request for the root folder (&quot;/&quot;) of a
    web server and displays the HTTP headers returned. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-headers.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-headers.html</a> . [Ron]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-malware-host.html">http-malware-host</a> is designed to discover hosts that are serving
    malware (perhaps because they were compromised), but so far it
    only checks for one specific attack. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-malware-host.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-malware-host.html</a> . [Ron]
<li>    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-groups.html">smb-enum-groups</a> displays a list of groups on the remote system
    along with their membership (like enum.exe -G). See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-users.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-users.html</a> [Ron]
</ul>
</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s --traceroute has been rewritten for better performance.
  Probes are sent in parallel to individual hosts, not just across all
  hosts as before. Trace consolidation is more sophisticated, allowing
  common traces to be identified sooner and fewer probes to be sent.
  The older traceroute could be very slow (taking minutes per target)
  if the target did not respond to the trace probes, and this new
  traceroute avoids that. In a trace of 110 hosts in a /24 over the
  Internet, the number of probes sent dropped 50% from 1565 to 743,
  and the time taken dropped 92% from 95 seconds to 7.6
  seconds. Traceroute now uses an ICMP echo request probe if no
  working probes against the target were discovered during
  scanning. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> After performing or loading a scan, you can now filter
  results to just the hosts you are interested in by pressing Ctrl+L
  (or the &quot;Filter Hosts&quot; button) to open the host filtering interface.
  This makes it easy to select just Linux hosts, or those running a
  certain version of Apache, or whatever interests you. You can easily
  modify the filter or remove it to see the whole scan again. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-filter.html">https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-filter.html</a> . [Josh Marlow]
</li><li>  For some UDP ports, Nmap will now send a protocol-specific payload
  that is more likely to get a response than an empty packet is. This
  improves the effectiveness of probes to those ports for host
  discovery, and also makes an open port more likely to be classified
  open rather than open|filtered. The ports and payloads are defined
  in payload.cc. The ports that have a payload are 7 (echo),
  53 (domain), 111 (rpcbind), 123 (ntp), 137 (netbios-ns), 161 (snmp),
  177 (xdmcp), 500 (isakmp), 520 (route), 1645 and 1812 (radius),
  2049 (nfs), 5353 (zeroconf), and 10080 (amanda). [David]
</li><li>  Integrated 1,349 fingerprints (and 81 corrections) submitted by Nmap
  users! They resulted in 342 new fingerprints (a 17% increase),
  including Google&#39;s Android Linux system for smart phones, Mac OS X
  10.6 (Snow Leopard), the Chumby, and a slew number of printers, broadband
  routers, and other devices (40 new vendors). See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/416">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/416</a> [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> For all the services which are commonly tunneled over SSL
  (pop3, http, imap, irc, smtp, etc.), we audited the scripts to
  ensure they can support that tunneling. The com.tryssl function
  was added for easy SSL detection. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/comm.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/comm.html</a> [Joao]
</li><li>  Nmap now prefers to display the hostname supplied by the user instead
  of the reverse-DNS name in most places. If a reverse DNS record
  exists, and it differs from the user-supplied name, it is printed
  like this:
<pre>
    Nmap scan report for www.google.com (74.125.53.103)
    rDNS record for 74.125.53.103: pw-in-f103.1e100.net
</pre>  And in XML it looks like:
<pre>
    &lt;hostnames&gt;
      &lt;hostname name=&quot;openbsd.org&quot; type=&quot;user&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;hostname name=&quot;cvs.openbsd.org&quot; type=&quot;PTR&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/hostnames&gt;
</pre>  Host latency is now printed more often. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/199">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/199</a> for a summary of other
  output changes. [David]
</li><li>  Ndiff now shows changes in script (NSE) output for each target
  host (in both text output format and XML). [David]
</li><li>  We now print output for down hosts, even when doing scanning beyond
  just a ping scan.  This always prints to XML and grepable output,
  and is printed to normal and interactive output in verbose mode. The
  format for printing a down host has changed slightly: &quot;Nmap scan
  report for 1.1.1.1 [host down]&quot; [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Default socket parallelism has been doubled from 10 to 20,
  which doubles speed in some situations. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/161">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/161</a>. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Version detection&#39;s maximum socket concurrency has been increased
  from 10-20 based on timing level to 20-40. This can dramatically
  speed up version detection when there are many open ports in a host
  group being scanned. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  The Nmap source tarball (and RPMs) now included man page
  translations (16 languages so far). Nmap always installs the English
  man page, and installs the translations by default. If you only want
  some of the translations, set the LINGUAS environmental variable to
  the language codes you are interested in (e.g. &quot;es de&quot;). You can
  specify the configure option --disable-nls or set LINGUAS to the
  empty string to avoid installation of any man page translations. The
  RPM always installs them. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a function for scripts to format their output in a
  consistent way. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/stdnse.html#format_output">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/stdnse.html#format_output</a>. [Ron]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Now supports worker threads so that a single script can
  perform multiple network operations concurrently. This patch also
  includes condition variables for synchronization. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/stdnse.html#new_thread">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/stdnse.html#new_thread</a>,
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/nmap.html#condvar">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/nmap.html#condvar</a>, and
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/294.">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/294.</a>
</li><li>  Fixed a problem in which the Nmap installer wrongly reported that
  the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (vcredist.exe)
  failed to install. We had to update a registry key--see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/164">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/164</a>. [Jah]
</li><li>  Added support for connecting to nameservers over IPv6. IPv6 addresses
  can be used in /etc/resolv.conf or with the --dns-servers option. The
  parallel reverse DNS resolver still only support IPv4 addresses, but
  it can look them up over IPv6. [Ankur Nandwani]
</li><li>  Zenmap now includes ports in the services view whenever Nmap found
  them &quot;interesting,&quot; whatever their state. Previously they were only
  included if the state was &quot;open&quot;, &quot;filtered&quot;, or &quot;open|filtered&quot;,
  which led to confusing behavior when a closed port showed up in the
  Services column but clicking on the service showed no ports in the
  display. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Now has configure-time ASCII art just like Nmap does:
<pre>
            .       .

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added HTTP pipelining support to the HTTP library and and to
  the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-userdir-enum.html">http-userdir-enum</a>, and sql-injection.nse
  scripts. Pipelining can increase speed dramatically for scripts
  which make many requests.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The HTTP library now caches responses from http.get or
  http.head so that resources aren&#39;t requested multiple times during
  the same Nmap run even if several scripts request them. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/733">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/733</a>. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat, Ndiff]</span> The exit codes of these programs now reflect whether
  they succeeded. For Ncat, 0 means the connection was successful, 1
  indicates a network error, and 2 indicates any other error. For
  Ndiff, 0 means the scans were equal, 1 means they were different,
  and 2 indicates a runtime error. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> In verbose mode, Ncat now prints the number of bytes read and
  written after the client connection is terminated. Ncat also now
  prints elapsed time. For example, &quot;Ncat finished: 16 bytes sent, 566
  bytes received in 8.05 seconds.&quot; [Venkat]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/telnet-brute.html">telnet-brute</a>.nse now uses the unpw database instead of a
  hard coded list. [Ron]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a>.nse now supports TLS negotiation against SMTP ports
  that support it. [Tom Sellers, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Scripts that are listed by name with the --script option now
  have their verbosity level automatically increased by one. Many
  will print negative results (&quot;no infection found&quot;) at a higher
  verbosity level. The idea is that if you ask for a script
  specifically, you are more interested in such results.
  [David, Patrick]
</li><li>  Upgraded our Winpcap installer to use the new WinPcap version 4.1.1.
  A bug which could prevent proper uninstallation of previous versions
  was fixed at the same time. Later we made it set some registry keys
  for compatibility with the official Winpcap project installer (see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/237">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/237</a>). [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Ncat now prints a message like &quot;Connection refused.&quot; by
  default when a socket error occurs. This used to require -v, but
  printing no message at all could make a failed connection look like
  success in a case like
<pre>
    ncat remote &lt; short-file</pre>
</li><li>  Zenmap no longer displays down hosts in the GUI. [Josh]
</li><li>  The Ndiff man page was dramatically improved with examples and
  sample output. See <a href="https://nmap.org/book/ndiff-man.html">https://nmap.org/book/ndiff-man.html</a> .
  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> At debug level 2 or higher (-d2), Nmap now prints all active
  scripts (running &amp; waiting) and a backtrace whenever a key is
  pressed. This can be quite helpful in debugging deadlocks and other
  script/NSE problems. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Nmap now allows you to specify --data-length 0, and that is now the
  documented way to disable the new UDP protocol-specific probe
  payload feature. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed compilation of our libdnet on Debian GNU/kFreeBSD (patch from
  Petr Salinger).
</li><li>  Our Windows packages are now built on Windows 7, though they are
  32-bit binaries and should continue to work on Win2K and later.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that could cause an infinite loop (&quot;Unable to find
  listening socket in get_rpc_results&quot;) in RPC scan. The loop would
  happen when scanning a port that sent no responses, and there was at
  least one other port to scan. Thanks to Lionel Cons for reporting
  the problem. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-zone-transfer.html">dns-zone-transfer</a> and whois script argument table syntax has been
  improved so you don&#39;t need curly braces.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-shares.html">smb-enum-shares</a>.nse now checks whether or not a share is
  writable by attempting to write a file (and deleting it if it&#39;s
  successful).  Significantly cleaned up the code, as well. [Ron]
</li><li>  The nselib/data directory is now installed. It was not installed
  before because of an error in the Makefile. The scripts that would
  not have worked after installation because they were missing data
  files are <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a>.nse, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html">http-favicon</a>.nse, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-iis-webdav-vuln.html">http-iis-webdav-vuln</a>.nse,
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-userdir-enum.html">http-userdir-enum</a>.nse, smb-pwdump.nse, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pop3-brute.html">pop3-brute</a>.nse,
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-brute.html">smb-brute</a>.nse, and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-brute.html">snmp-brute</a>.nse. [David]
</li><li>  Upgraded the included libpcap to 1.0.0. [David]
</li><li>  Optimize MAC address prefix lookup by using an std::map rather than
  a custom hash table. This increases performance and code simplicity
  at the cost of some extra memory consumption. In one test, this
  reduced the time of a single target ARP ping scan from 0.59 seconds
  to 0.13. [David]
</li><li>  Added -Pn and -sn as aliases for -PN and -sP, respectively. They
  will eventually become the recommended and documented way to disable
  host discovery (ping scanning) and port scanning. They are more
  consistent and also match the existing -n option for disabling
  reverse DNS resolution. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed an error in the handling of exclude groups that used IPv4
  ranges. Si Stransky reported the problem and provided a number of
  useful test cases in <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/276">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/276</a>. The
  error caused various assertion failures along the lines of
<pre>
    TargetGroup.cc:465: int
    TargetGroup::get_next_host(sockaddr_storage*, size_t*):
    Assertion `ipsleft &gt; 1&#39; failed.
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Improved the authentication used by the smb-* scripts. Instead of
  looking in a bunch of places (registry, command-line, etc) for the
  usernames/passwords, a table is kept. This lets us store any number
  of accounts for later use, and remove them if they stop working. This
  also fixes a bug where typing in a password incorrectly would lock
  out an account (since it wouldn&#39;t stop trying the account in question).
  [Ron]
</li><li>  Removed IP ID matching in packet headers returned in ICMP errors.
  This was already the case for some operating systems that are known
  to mangle the IDs of sent IP packets. Requiring such a match could
  occasionally cause valid replies to be ignored. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/580">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/580</a> for an example of host
  order affecting scan results due to this phenomenon. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The HTTP library now handles chunked transfer decoding more
  robustly. See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/13">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/13</a> [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Unexpected error messages from scripts now include the target
  host and port number. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed many libraries which were inappropriately using global
  variables, meaning that multiple scripts running concurrently could
  overwrite each others values. NSE now automatically checks for this
  problem at runtime, and we have a static code checker
  (check_globals) available as well. See this whole thread
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/70">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/70</a>. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Added some additional matching rules to keep a reply to a SYN probe
  from matching an ACK probe to the same port, or vice versa, in ping
  scans that include both scan types. Such a mismatch could cause an
  ineffective timing ping or traceroute probe to be selected. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> There is a new command-line option, --confdir, which sets
  the per-user configuration directory. Its value defaults to
  $HOME/.zenmap. This was suggested by Jesse McCoppin. [David]
</li><li>  Open bpf devices in read/write mode, not read-only, in libdnet on
  BSD. This is to work around a bug in Mac OS X 10.6 that causes
  incoming traffic to become invisible. [David]
</li><li>  &quot;make install&quot; now removes from the Nmap script directory some
  scripts which only existed in previous versions of Nmap but weren&#39;t
  deleted during upgrades. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the reconnect_ssl method for sockets. We sometimes need
  to reconnect a socket with SSL because the initial communication on
  the socket is done without SSL. See this thread for more details:
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/3">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/3</a> [Patrick, Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash that could occur when entering certain
  characters in the target entry (those whose UTF-8 encoding contains
  a byte that counts as whitespace in the Windows locale):
<pre>
    File &quot;zenmapGUI\ScanNotebook.pyo&quot;, line 184, in _target_entry_changed
    File &quot;zenmapCore\NmapOptions.pyo&quot;, line 719, in render_string
    UnicodeDecodeError: &#39;utf8&#39; codec can&#39;t decode byte 0xc3 in position 1:
      unexpected end of data
</pre>  For more details on this curious problem, see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/82">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/82</a> [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> There is a new function, nmap.bind, to set the source address
  of a socket. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Made it a fatal error instead of silent memory corruption
  when an attempt is made to use a file descriptor whose number is not
  less than FD_SETSIZE. This applies only on non-Windows platforms
  where FD_SETSIZE is a limit on the value of file descriptors as well
  as a limit on the number of descriptors in the set. The error will
  look like
<pre>
    nsock_core.c:186: Attempt to FD_SET fd 1024, which is not less
    than FD_SETSIZE (1024). Try using a lower parallelism.
</pre>  Thanks to Brandon Enright for discovering the problem and much help
  debugging it, and to Jay Fink for submitting an initial patch. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed proxy connections in connect mode on Windows. Because
  the dup function does not work on Windows, an assertion failure
  would be raised reading
<pre>
    (fh &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; (unsigned)fd &lt; (unsigned)_nhandle)
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed the combination of --max-conns and --exec on Windows.
  The count of connected clients was not decreased when the program
  spawned by --exec finished. With --max-conns 5, for example, no more
  connections would be allowed after the fifth, even if some of the
  earlier ones had ended. Jon Greaves reported the problem and Venkat
  contributed a patch.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The code that manages the count of connected clients has been
  made robust with respect to signals. The code was contributed by
  Solar Designer.
</li><li>  The files read by the -iL (input from file) and --excludefile
  options now support comments that start with # and go to the end of
  the line. [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> On Windows, Zenmap no longer uses the cmd.exe shell to run
  Nmap sub-processes. This means that canceling a scan will kill the
  Nmap process as it does on other platforms (previously it would just
  kill the shell). It also means that that scanning will work as a
  user whose name contains characters like &#39;&amp;&#39; that are significant to
  the shell.  Mike Crawford and Nick Marsh reported bugs related to
  this. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> All scripts (except for those in &quot;version&quot; or &quot;demo&quot;
  categories) are now classified in either the &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;intrusive&quot;
  categories, based on how likely they are to cause problems when run
  against other machines on the network. Those classifications already
  existed, but weren&#39;t used consistently. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Added a check for a SMBv2 vulnerability (CVE-2009-3103) to
  smb-check-vulns. Due to its nature (it performs a DoS, then checks
  if the system is still online), the script isn&#39;t run by default and
  requires a special script-arg to work. [Ron]
</li><li>  Fixed an integer overflow in uptime calculation which could occur
  when a target with a low TCP timestamp clock frequency uses large
  timestamp values, such that a naive uptime calculation shows a boot
  time before the epoch. Also fixed a printf format specifier mismatch
  that was revealed by the bug. Toby Simmons reported the problem and
  helped with the fix.  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The HTTP library now supports HTTP cookies. [Joao Correa]
</li><li>  Fixed a compile error on NetBSD. It was
<pre>
    tcpip.cc:2948: error: pointer of type &#39;void *&#39; used in arithmetic
</pre>  Thanks to Jay Fink for reporting the problem and submitting a patch.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> If you have any hosts or services selected, they will
  remain selected after aggregating another scan or running a filter
  (as long as they are still up and visible). Previously the selection
  was lost whenever the scan inventory was changed. This is
  particularly important due to the new host filter system. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> New translation: Russian (contributed by Alexander Khodyrev).
  Updated translations: French and German.
</li><li>  Nmap now generates IP addresses without <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/duplicates.html">duplicates</a> (until you cycle
  through all the allowed IPs) thanks to a new collision-free 32-bit
  number generator in nbase_rnd.c. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/695">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/695</a> [Brandon]
</li><li>  There is a new OS detection pseudo-test, SCAN.DC, which records how
  the network distance in SCAN.DS was calculated. Its value can be &quot;L&quot;
  for localhost, &quot;D&quot; for a direct connection, &quot;I&quot; for an ICMP TTL
  calculation, and &quot;T&quot; for a traceroute hop count. This is mainly for
  the benefit of OS integration, when it is sometimes important to
  distinguish between DS=1%DC=I (probably the result of forged TTLs)
  and DS=1%DC=D (a true one-hop connection.) [David]
</li><li>  Canonicalized the list of OS detection device types to a smaller set
  with descriptions: <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/device-types.txt">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/device-types.txt</a> .
  [David, Fyodor, Doug]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The --idle-timeout option now exits when *both* stdin and the
  socket have been idle for the given time. Previously it would exit
  when *either* of them had been idle, meaning that the program would
  quit contrary to your expectation when downloading a large file
  without sending anything, for example. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Ncat now always prefixes its own output messages with &quot;Ncat: &quot;
  or &quot;NCAT DEBUG: &quot; to make it clear that they are not coming from the
  remote host. This only matters when output goes to a terminal, where
  the standard output and standard error streams are mixed. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s Nbase library now has a new hexdump() function which produces
  output similar to Wireshark. nmap_hexdump() is a wrapper which
  prints the output using Nmap&#39;s log_write facility. The old hdump()
  and lamont_dump() functions have been removed. [Luis]
</li><li>  Added explicit casts to (int)(unsigned char) for arguments to ctype function
  calls in nmap, ncat and nbase.  Thanks to Solar Designer for pointing out
  the need and fix for this. [Josh]
</li><li>  Ncat now supports wildcard SSL certificates.  The wildcard character
  (*) can be in commonname field or in DNS field of Subject
  Alternative Name (SAN) Extension of SSL certificate. Matching Rules:
<ul><li>&#39;*&#39; should be only on the leftmost component of FQDN. (*.example.com
    but not www.*.com or www.example*.com).
</li><li>The leftmost component should contain only &#39;*&#39; and it should be
    followed by &#39;.&#39; (*.example.com but not *w.example.com or
    w*.example.com).
</li><li>There should be at least three components in FQDN. (*.example.com but
    not *.com or *.com.). [venkat]</li></ul>

</li><li>  Nmap now handles the case when a primary network interface (venet0)
  does not have an address assigned but its aliases do (venet0:1
  etc.). This could result in the error messages
<pre>
    Failed to find device venet0 which was referenced in /proc/net/route
    Failed to lookup subnet/netmask for device (venet0): venet0: no IPv4 address assigned
</pre>  This was observed under OpenVZ. [Dmitry Levin]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The --<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a>, --ssl-key, and --ssl-trustfile options now
  automatically turn on SSL mode. Previously they were ignored if
  --ssl was not also used. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Now Nsock supports pure TLSv1 and SSLv3 servers in addition
  to the (already supported and far more common) SSLv2 and SSLv23
  servers.  Ncat currently never uses SSLv2 for security reasons, so
  it is unaffected by this change.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Implemented basic SCTP client functionality (server already
  exists).  Only the default SCTP stream is used.  This is also called
  TCP compatible mode.  While it allows Ncat to be used for manually
  probing open SCTP ports, more complicated services making use of
  multiple streams or depending on specific message boundaries cannot
  be talked to successfully.  [Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Implemented SSL over SCTP in both client (connect) and server
  (listen) modes. [Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  Nmap now filters received ARP packets based on their target address
  address field, not the destination address in the enclosing ethernet
  frame. Some operating systems, including Windows 7 and Solaris 10,
  are known to at least sometimes send their ARP replies to the
  broadcast address and Nmap wouldn&#39;t notice them. The symptom of this
  was that root scans wouldn&#39;t work (&quot;Host seems down&quot;) but non-root
  scans would work. Thanks to Mike Calmus and Vijay Sankar for
  reporting the problem, and Marcus Haebler for suggesting the
  fix. [David]
</li><li>  The -fno-strict-aliasing option is now used unconditionally when
  using GCC. It was already this way, in effect, because a test
  against the GCC version number was reversed: &lt;= 4 rather than &gt;= 4.
  Solar Designer reported the problem.
</li><li>  Nmap now prints a warning instead of a fatal error when the hardware
  address of an interface can&#39;t be found. This is the case for
  FireWire interfaces, which have a hardware address format not
  supported by libdnet. Thanks to Julian Berdych for the bug report.
  [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap&#39;s UI performance has improved significantly thanks to
  optimization of the update_ui() function. In particular, this speeds
  up the new host filter system. [Josh]
</li><li>  Add a service probe for DNS-based service discovery (DNS-SD). See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0610.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0610.html</a> . [David]
</li><li>  Made RPC grinding work from service detection again by changing the
  looked-for service name from &quot;rpc&quot; to &quot;rpcbind&quot;, the name it has in
  nmap-service-probes. Also removed some dead code. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a log_write call and a pfatal call to use a syntax which is
  safer from format strings bugs.  This allows Nmap to build with the
  gcc -Wformat -Werror=format-security options. [Guillaume Rousse,
  Dmitry Levin]
</li><li>  A bug in Nsock was fixed: On systems where a non-blocking connect
  could succeed immediately, connections that were requested to be
  tunneled through SSL would actually be plain text. This could be
  verified with an Ncat client and server running on localhost. This
  was observed to happen with localhost connections on FreeBSD 7.2.
  Non-localhost connections were likely not affected. The bug was
  reported by Daniel Roethlisberger. [David]
</li><li>  Ncat proxy now hides the proxy&#39;s response (&quot;HTTP/1.0 200 OK&quot; or
  whatever it may be). Before, if you retrieved a file through a
  proxy, it would have the &quot;HTTP/1.0 200 OK&quot; stuck to the top of
  it. For this Ncat uses blocking sockets until the proxy negotiation
  is done and once it is successful, Nsock takes over for rest of the
  connection.[Venkat]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> socket garbage collection was rewritten for better performance
  and to ensure that socket slots are immediately available to others
  after a socket is closed.  See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0624.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0624.html</a> . [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a rare but possible segfault which could occur if the
  nsock binding attempted to push values on the stack of a thread
  which had already ended due to an error, and if that internal Lua
  stack was already completely full. This bug is very hard to
  reproduce with a SEGFAULT but is usually visible when Lua assertion
  checks are turned on. A socket handler routine must be called AFTER
  a thread has ended in error. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed an error that would cause Ncat to use 100% CPU in
  broker mode after a client disconnected or a read error happened.
  [Kris, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> --script-args may now have whitespace in unquoted strings (but
  surrounding whitespace is ignored). For example,
  --script-args &#39;greeting = This is a greeting&#39; Becomes:
  { [&quot;greeting&quot;] = &quot;This is a greeting&quot; } [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Using --send-only in conjunction with the plain listen or
  broker modes now behaves as it should: nothing will be read from the
  network end.  Ncat previously read and discarded any data
  received. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Added a socket_count abstraction that counts the number of
  read or write events pending on a socket, for the purpose of
  maintaining an fd_set. The bit is set in the fd_set whenever the
  count is positive, and cleared when it is zero. The reason for doing
  this was that write bits were not being properly cleared when using
  Ncat with SSL in connect mode, such that a client send would cause
  Ncat to use 100% CPU until it received something from the
  server. See the thread at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0413.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0413.html</a> . This change will
  also make it easier to use a different back end than select in the
  future. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nsock]</span> Added compilation dependency generation (makefile.dep)
  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The --broker option now automatically implies --listen. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a logic error in getinterfaces_siocgifconf. The check for
  increasing the capacity of the list of interfaces was off by
  one. This caused a crash on initialization for systems with more
  than 16 network interfaces. [David]
</li><li>  Added Apache JServe protocol version detection probe and signatures
  and some some other nmap-service-probes patches. [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  Fixed two memory leaks in ncat_posix.c and a bug where an open file was not
  being closed in libdnet-stripped/src/intf.c [Josh Marlow]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added profile editor support for the Nmap SCTP options:
  -PY, -sY and -sZ. [Josh Marlow]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in --data-length parsing which in some cases could
  result in useless buffer allocations and unpredictable payload
  lengths. See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0763.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0763.html</a> [Luis]
</li><li>  The configure script now allows cross-compiling by assuming that
  libpcap is recent enough to use rather than trying to compile and
  run a test program. Libpcap will always be recent enough when Nmap&#39;s
  included copy is used. [Mike Frysinger]
</li><li>  Updated the IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)
  generation. The Mac OS prefix file was updated as
  well. [Kris, Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fix a bug which could cause a crash in the (very rare) case
  where Nmap would produce port tags in XML output without a state
  attribute. [David]
</li><li>  Added a convenience top-level BSDmakefile which automatically
  redirects BSD make to GNU make on BSD systems. The Nmap Makefile
  relies on numerous GNU Make extensions. [Daniel Roethlisberger]

<li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a display hanging problem on Mac OS X reported by
  Christopher Caldwell at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0721.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0721.html</a> .  This was done by
  adding gtk2 back to macports-1.8.0-universal.diff and removing the
  dependency on shared-mime-info so it doesn&#39;t expect /usr/share/mime
  files at runtime. Also included GDK pixbuf loaders statically rather
  than as external loadable modules.  [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a memory bug (access of freed memory) when loading exclude
  targets with --exclude. This was reported to occasionally cause a
  crash. Will Cladek reported the bug and contributed an initial
  patch. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap application icons were regenerated using the newer SVG

<li>  The host discovery (ping probe) defaults have been enhanced to
  include twice as many probes.  The default is now &quot;-PE -PS443 -PA80
  -PP&quot;. In exhaustive testing of 90 different probes, this emerged as
  the best four-probe combination, finding 14% more Internet hosts
  than the previous default, &quot;-PE -PA80&quot;. The default for non-root
  users is -PS80,443, replacing the previous default of -PS80. In
  addition, ping probes are now sent in order of effectiveness (-PE
  first) so that less effective probes may not have to be sent. ARP
  ping is still the default on local ethernet networks. [David,
  Fyodor]
</li><li>  Added SCTP port scanning support to Nmap. SCTP is a layer 4 protocol
  used mostly for telephony related applications.  This brings the
  following new features:
<ul><li>SCTP INIT chunk port scan (-sY): open ports return an INIT-ACK
    chunk, closed ones an ABORT chunk.  This is the SCTP equivalent
    of a TCP SYN stealth scan.
</li><li>SCTP COOKIE-ECHO chunk port scan (-sZ): open ports are silent,
    closed ports return an ABORT chunk.
</li><li>SCTP INIT chunk ping probes (-PY): host discovery using SCTP
    INIT chunk packets.
</li><li>SCTP-specific IP protocol scan (-sO -p sctp).
</li><li>SCTP-specific traceroute support (--traceroute).
</li><li>The ability to use the deprecated Adler32 algorithm as specified
    in RFC 2960 instead of CRC32C from RFC 4960 (--adler32).
</li><li>42 well-known SCTP ports were added to the nmap-services file.
</li><li>The server scanme.csnc.ch has been set up for your SCTP scan
    testing pleasure. But note that SCTP doesn&#39;t pass through most
    NAT devices. See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0669.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0669.html</a> .</li></ul>
  Part of the work on SCTP support was kindly sponsored by
  Compass Security AG, Switzerland. [Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-iis-webdav-vuln.html">http-iis-webdav-vuln</a>.nse, which detects the recently
  discovered WebDAV unicode bug in MS IIS 5.1/6.0 web server which can
  allow arbitrary users to access password protected folders without
  authentication. See

</li><li>  The Nmap Reference Guide has been translated to German by Open
  Source Press and Indonesian by Tedi Heriyanto. You can now read it
  in 16 languages at <a href="https://nmap.org/docs.html">https://nmap.org/docs.html</a> . We&#39;re always looking
  for more translations of Nmap and its documentation--if you&#39;d like
  to help, see <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0667.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0667.html</a> .
</li><li>  Open Source Press completed and released the German translation of
  the official Nmap book (Nmap Network Scanning). Learn more at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/#translations.">https://nmap.org/book/#translations.</a>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/socks-open-proxy.html">socks-open-proxy</a>.nse for scanning networks for open
  SOCKS proxy servers. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/socks-open-proxy.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/socks-open-proxy.html</a> . [Joao Correa]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-open-proxy.html">http-open-proxy</a>.nse has been updated to attempt HEAD and
  CONNECT methods as well as previously supported GET method.  It
  still tries to reach <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> through the proxy by
  default, but now also offers an argument for specifying a different
  URL. [Joao Correa]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> There is a backwards-incompatible change in the way that
  listen mode works. The new default behavior is to accept only one
  connection, and quit when the connection ends. This was necessary to
  prevent data loss in some situations; some programs require Ncat to
  send an EOF before they flush their internal buffers and finish
  processing the last bit of data. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0528.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0528.html</a> for more information.
  Use the new -k or --keep-open option to get the old behavior, in
  which Ncat will accept multiple simultaneous connection, combine all
  their input, and accept more connections after a disconnection.
  [Daniel Roethlisberger, David]
</li><li>  Ncat handling of newlines on Windows has been improved. CRLF is
  automatically converted to a bare LF when input is from the console,
  but left untouched when it is from a pipe or a file. No newline
  translation is done on output (where it was being done before). This
  makes it possible to transfer binary files with Ncat on Windows
  without any corruption, while still being able to interactively ncat
  into UNIX shells and other processes which require bare
  newlines. Ncat clients now work the same way on UNIX and Windows in
  that respect.  For cases where you do want \r\n line endings (such
  as connections to web and email servers or Windows cmd.exe shells),
  specify -C whether your client is running on UNIX or
  Windows. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap RPM packages (x86 and x86-64) are now built with OpenSSL
  support (statically linked in to avoid dependencies).  They are also
  now built on CentOS 5.3 for compatibility with RHEL, Fedora, and
  other distributions. Please let us know if you discover any
  compatibility problems (or other issues) with the new RPMs. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The Topology tab now has a &quot;Save Graphic&quot; button that
  allows saving the current topology display as a PNG, postscript,
  PDF, and SVG image.  [Joao Medeiros, David]
</li><li>  Changed the default UDP ping (-PU) port from 31338 to 40125.  This
  appears to be a better port based on David&#39;s empirical testing.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/imap-capabilities.html">imap-capabilities</a> script, which uses the CAPABILITY
  command to determine the capabilities of a target IMAP mail server.
  A simple supporting IMAP library was added as well. See
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/imap-capabilities.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/imap-capabilities.html</a> . [Brandon]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Brandon Enright from UCSD reports that, thanks to all the NSE
  fixes in this release, he no longer sees any Nmap crashes in his
  large scale scans. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0639.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0639.html</a> .
</li><li>  Zenmap now works on RHEL/CentOS since it no longer requires the
  hashlib library (which was introduced in Python 2.5, but RHEL 5
  still uses 2.4) and removing the pysqlite2 requirement (RHEL does
  not offer that module).  It is still desirable to have pysqlite2
  when available, since it enables Zenmap searching and database
  saving features. [David]
</li><li>  Ncat can now send SSL certificates in connect mode for client
  authentication by using the --<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a> and --ssl-key options.  The
  specified certificates are only sent when requested by the
  server. [Venkat]
</li><li>  Nmap can now handle -PS and -PA at the same time when running nmap
  as non-root or using IPv6.  It now combines the two port lists [Josh
  Marlow]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> SSL in listen mode now works on systems like BSD in which a
  socket inherits its blocking or non-blocking status from the
  listening socket. [David, Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  The --packet-trace/--version-trace options now shows the names of
  version detection probes as they are sent, making the version
  detection process easier to understand and debug. [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  The GPG detached signatures for Nmap releases now use the more
  standard .asc extension rather than .gpg.txt.  They can still be
  found at <a href="https://nmap.org/dist/sigs">https://nmap.org/dist/sigs</a>/ and the .gpg.txt versions for
  previous releases are still available for compatibility reasons. For
  instructions on verifying Nmap package integrity, see
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/install.html#inst-integrity">https://nmap.org/book/install.html#inst-integrity</a>. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed two bugs: 1) When two scans are performed in Zenmap
  and aggregated, the first one was being modified in the process,
  preventing you from doing diffs in the &quot;compare scans&quot; dialogue or
  properly saving the first scan individually. 2) If you start two
  scans, then the faster one finishes and you cancel and remove the
  slower one while still in progress, much of the results from both
  scans are lost. [Josh Marlow]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> When connecting to an SSL service in verbose mode, Ncat now
  prints confirmation of the SSL connection, some certificate
  information, and a cert fingerprint. For example:
  SSL connection to 64.147.188.3:443. Electronic Frontier Foundation
  SHA-1 fingerprint: 28BE B476 2E49 7ED5 3A9B 4D79 AD1E 69A9 82DB C75A
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Clean up output (generally reducing default verbosity) for the
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/p2p-conficker.html">p2p-conficker</a>, smb-check-vulns, and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-iis-webdav-vuln.html">http-iis-webdav-vuln</a> scripts. In
  general, we don&#39;t ask scripts to report that a host is clean unless
  Nmap&#39;s verbosity level (-v) is at least one or two. [Ron, Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added the -PS22,25,80 option found in the Quick Traceroute
  profile to some of the Intense scan profiles for improved host
  discovery. [Josh Marlow]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug with the --defeat-rst-ratelimit option which prevented
  it from working properly.  See this thread:
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0476.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0476.html</a> . [Josh]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> Avoid printing a &quot;Not shown:&quot; line if there weren&#39;t any
  ports in the non-shown (extraports) list. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed Ncat compilation with versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.7.
  Previously it would fail in ncat_openssl.c with the message
  &quot;structure has no member named `it&#39;&quot;. The problem was reported by
  Jaroslav Fojtik. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Removed the packet.hextobin(str) and packet.bintohex(str)
  functions. They are redundant since you get the same functionality
  by calling bin.pack(&quot;H&quot;, str) and bin.unpack(&quot;H&quot;, str),
  respectively. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed the parsing of --script-args, which was only accepting
  alphanumeric characters and underscores in values. Now a key, value,
  or array value may be a sequence of any characters except &#39;{&#39;, &#39;}&#39;,
  &#39;,&#39;, &#39;=&#39;, and all space characters. You may overcome this
  restriction by using quotes (single or double) to allow all
  characters within the quotation marks. You may also use the quote
  delimiter inside the sequence so long as it is escaped by a
  backslash. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0211.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0211.html</a> . [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> When a script ends for any reason, all of its mutexes are now
  unlocked.  This prevents a permanent (and painful to debug) deadlock
  when a script crashes without unlocking a mutex. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0533.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0533.html</a> . [Patrick]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug wherein nmap would not display the post-scan count of
  raw packets sent during a SYN ping scan (-sP -PS). [Josh Marlow]
</li><li>  Changed the ICMP ping probes to use a random non-zero ICMP id.
  David&#39;s empirical testing found that some hosts drop probes when the
  ICMP id is 0 [Josh Marlow]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a --script argument processing bug in which Nmap would
  abort when an expression matches a set of scripts which were loaded
  by other expressions first (a simple example is &quot;--script
  default,DEFAULT&quot;. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Operating system icons are now always loaded as PNGs, even on
  platforms which support SVG images. That is much faster, and Zenmap
  currently never scales the images anyway. [Josh]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The Nmap Windows uninstaller now removes the Ncat CA list
  (ca-bundle.crt) which has been installed since 4.85BETA9. [Jah]
</li><li>  Optimized some Nmap version detection match lines for slightly
  better performance. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0328.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0328.html</a> . [Brandon]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Upon connection failure, a socket now immediately unlocks its
  &quot;socket lock&quot; to allow other pending socket connections to succeed
  sooner. This slightly improves scan speeds by eliminating the wait
  for garbage collection to free the resource. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Corrected a bug in nse_nsock.cc that could result in a crash
  from the use of an invalid Lua state if a thread is collected due to
  timeout or other rare reasons. Essentially, the callbacks from the
  nsock library were returning to an already-collected Lua state. We
  now maintain a reference to the Lua State Thread in the nsock
  userdata environment table to prevent early collection.  This is a
  temporary patch for the stable release pending a more detailed
  review of the NSE nsock library binding. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> When an NSE script in the database (script.db) is requested
  but not found on the filesystem, Nmap now prints a warning rather
  than aborting. We accidentally shipped with such a phantom script
  (smb-check-vulns-2.nse) in 4.85BETA8. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug where an ICMP echo, timestamp, or address mask reply
  could be matched up with the wrong ICMP probe if more than one ICMP
  probe type was being sent (as with the new default ping). This lead
  to timing calculation problems. [David]
</li><li>  Improved the host expression parser to better handle a few cases
  where invalid target specifiers would case Nmap to scan unintended
  hosts. See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0319.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0319.html</a> . [Jah]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash, introduced in 4.85BETA4, that happened when
  searching scan results by date. [David]
  The error message was: File &quot;zenmapGUI\SearchGUI.pyo&quot;, line 816, in
  set_date TypeError: argument must be sequence of length 9, not 3
</li><li>  Patched configure.ac to detect Lua include and library files in
  &quot;lua5.1&quot; subdirectories of /usr/include and the like. Debian
  apparently puts them there. We still check the likes of
  /usr/include/lua.h and /usr/include/lua/lua.h as well. [Jan
  Christoph Nordholz]
</li><li>  Improved nsock&#39;s fselect() to be a more complete replacement for
  select() on the Windows platform. In particularly, any or all of the
  FD sets can be null or empty descriptor sets. This fixes an error
  (&quot;nsock_loop error 10022&quot;) which would occur when you ran ncat
  --send-only on Windows. [David]
</li><li>  The --with-openssl= directive now works for specifying the SSL
  location to the nsock library.  It was previously not passing the
  proper include file path to the compiler. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  The --traceroute feature is now properly disabled for IPv6 ping
  scans (-6 -sP) since IPv6 traceroute is not currently
  supported. [Jah]
</li><li>  Fixed an assertion failure which could occur on at least SPARC Linux
  The error looked like &quot;nsock_core.c:294: handle_connect_result:
  Assertion `0&#39; failed. Aborted&quot;. [David Fifield, Fabio Pedretti]
</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s make install target now uses $(INSTALL) rather than cp to
  copy NSE scripts and libraries to ensure that file permissions are
  set properly. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Improved the Oracle DB version detection signatures. [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Remove the old nse_macros.h header file. This involved
  removing the SCRIPT_ENGINE_* status defines, moving the likes of
  SCRIPT_ENGINE_LUA_DIR to nse_main.h, removing the last remaining use
  of SCRIPT_ENGINE_TRY, and moving the FILES and DIRS defines to
  nse_fs.h. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Cleaned up the libpcre build system a bit by removing Makefile.am
  and modifying configure.ac to prevent unnecessary removal of
  pcre_chartables.cc in some instances. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which would cause Nmap to sometimes miscount the number
  of hosts scanned and produce warnings such as &quot;WARNING: No targets
  were specified, so 0 hosts scanned&quot; when --traceroute and -sP were
  combined. [Jah]
</li><li>  Changed Nmap and Ncat&#39;s configure.ac files to check in more
  situations whether -ldl is required for compilation and add it where
  necessary. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  When building Nmap RPMs using the spec file, you can now pass in an
  openssl argument, the contents of which are passed to ./configure&#39;s
  --with-openssl option. So you can pass rpmbuild an option such as
  --define &quot;openssl /usr/local/ssl&quot;. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Fixed the make distclean target to avoid a failure which could occur
  when you ran it right after a make clean (it might have failed in
  other situations as well). [David]
</li><li>  Updated nmap-mac-prefixes with the latest MAC address prefix data
  from <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt">http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt</a> as of
  5/20/09. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Ncat now makes sockets blocking before handing them off to another
  program with --exec or --sh-exec. This is to resolve a failure where
  the command &quot;ncat --exec /usr/bin/yes localhost&quot; would stop sending
  because yes would send data so quickly that kernel send buffers
  could not keep up and socket writes would start generating EAGAIN
  errors. [Venkat]
</li><li>  Ncat now ignores SIGPIPE in listen mode.  This fixes the command
  &quot;yes | ncat -l --keep-open --send-only&quot;, which was failing after the
  first client disconnected due to a broken pipe signal when Ncat
  would try to write more date before realizing that the client had
  closed the connection.
</li><li>  Version detection can now detect Ncat&#39;s --chat mode. [David]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.85BETA9 [2009-05-12] <a class="versionlink" id="4.85BETA9" href="#4.85BETA9" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Integrated all of your 1,156 of your OS detection submissions and
  your 50 corrections since January 8.  Please keep them coming!  The
  second generation OS detection DB has grown 14% to more than 2,000
  fingerprints!  That is more than we ever had with the first system.
  The 243 new fingerprints include Microsoft Windows 7 beta, Linux
  2.6.28, and much more.  See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0335.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0335.html</a> . [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> A whole lot of work was done by David to improve SSL
  security and functionality:
<ul><li>Ncat now does certificate domain and trust validation against
    trusted certificate lists if you specify --ssl-verify.
</li><li>[Ncat] To enable SSL certificate verification on systems whose
    default trusted certificate stores aren&#39;t easily usable by
    OpenSSL, we install a set of certificates extracted from Windows
    in the file ca-bundle.crt. The trusted contents of this file are
    added to whatever default trusted certificates the operating
    system may provide. [David]
</li><li>Ncat now automatically generates a temporary keypair and
    certificate in memory when you request it to act as an SSL server
    but you don&#39;t specify your own key using --ssl-key and --<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a>
    options. [David]
</li><li>[Ncat] In SSL mode, Ncat now always uses secure connections,
    meaning that it uses only good ciphers and doesn&#39;t use
    SSLv2. Certificates can optionally be verified with the
    --ssl-verify and --ssl-trustfile options. Nsock provides the
    option of making SSL connections that prioritize either speed or
    security; Ncat uses security while version detection and NSE
    continue to use speed. [David]</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added Boolean Operators for --script. You may now use (&quot;and&quot;,
  &quot;or&quot;, or &quot;not&quot;) combined with categories, filenames, and wildcarded filenames
  to match a set files.  Parenthetical subexpressions are allowed for
  precedence too.  For example, you can now run:
<pre>
    nmap --script &quot;(default or safe or intrusive) and not http-*&quot; scanme.nmap.org
</pre>  For more details, see
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-args">https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-args</a>. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The HTTP proxy server now works on Windows too. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The command wizard has been removed. The profile editor has
  the same capabilities with a better interface that doesn&#39;t require
  clicking through many screens. The profile editor now has its own
  &quot;Scan&quot; button that lets you run an edited command line immediately
  without saving a new profile. The profile editor now comes up
  showing the current command rather than being blank. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added an small animated throbber which indicates that a
  scan is still running (similar in concept to the one on the
  upper-right Firefox corner which animates while a page is
  loading). [David]
</li><li>  Regenerate script.db to remove references to non-existent
  smb-check-vulns-2.nse. This caused the following error messages when
  people used the --script=all option: &quot;nse_main.lua:319:
  smb-check-vulns-2.nse is not a file!&quot;  The script.db entries are now
  sorted again to make diffs easier to read. [David, Patrick]
</li><li>  Fixed --script-updatedb on Windows--it was adding bogus backslashes
  preceding file names in the generated script.db. Reported by
  Michael Patrick at <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0192.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0192.html</a>,
  and fixed by Jah.  The error message was also improved.
</li><li>  The official Windows binaries are now compiled with MS Visual C++
  2008 Express Edition SP1 rather than the RTM version. We also now
  distribute the matching SP1 version of the MS runtime components
  (vcredist_x86.exe). A number of compiler warnings were fixed
  too. [Fyodor,David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in the new NSE Lua core which caused it to round
  fractional runlevel values to the next integer. This could cause
  dependency problems for the smb-* scripts and others which rely on
  floating point runlevel values (e.g. that <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-brute.html">smb-brute</a> at runlevel 0.5
  will run before <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-system-info.html">smb-system-info</a> at the default runlevel of 1).
</li><li>  The SEQ.CI OS detection test introduced in 4.85BETA4 now has some
  examples in nmap-os-db and has been assigned a MatchPoints value of
  50. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> When using --send-only, Ncat will now close the network
  connection and terminate after receiving EOF on standard input.
  This is useful for, say, piping a file to a remote ncat where you
  don&#39;t care to wait for any response.  [Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fix hostname resolution on BSD systems where a recently
  fixed libc bug caused getaddrinfo(3) to fail unless a socket type
  hint is provided. Patch originally provided by Hajimu Umemoto of
  FreeBSD. [Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed bug in the DNS library which caused the error message
  &quot;nselib/dns.lua:54: &#39;for&#39; limit must be a number&quot;. [Jah]
</li><li>  Fixed Solaris 10 compilation by renaming a yield structure which
  conflicted with a yield function declared in unistd.h on that
  platform. [Pieter Bowman, Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Minor code cleanup of Ncat memory allocation and string
  duplication calls. [Ithilgore]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which could cause -iR to only scan the first host group
  and then terminate prematurely.  The problem related to the way
  hosts are counted by o.numhosts_scanned. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in the su-to-zenmap.sh script so that, in the cases
  where it calls su, it uses the proper -c option rather than
  -C. [Michal Januszewski, Henry Gebhardt]
</li><li>  Overhaul the NSE documentation &quot;Usage and Examples&quot; section and add
  many more examples: <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html">https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html</a> [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Made hexify in nse_nsock.cc take an unsigned char * to work
  around an assertion in Visual C++ in Debug mode. The isprint,
  isalpha, etc. functions from ctype.h have an assertion that the
  value of the character passed in is &lt;= 255. If you pass a character
  whose value is &gt;= 128, it is cast to an unsigned int, making it a
  large positive number and failing the assertion. This is the same
  thing that was reported in
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q2/0257.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q2/0257.html</a>, in regard to
  non-ASCII characters in nmap-mac-prefixes. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a segmentation fault which could occur in scripts which
  use the NSE pcap library. The problem was reported by Lionel Cons
  and fixed by Patrick.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Port script start/finish debug messages now show the target
  port number as well as the host/IP. [Jah]
</li><li>  Updated IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)
  generation. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed http.table_argument so that user-supplied HTTP headers
  are now properly sent in HTTP requests. [Jah]

<li>  Ncat&#39;s HTTP proxy now supports the GET, HEAD, and POST methods in
  addition to the CONNECT tunneling method, so it can be used as a
  proxy with an ordinary web browser.[David]
</li><li>  Ncat can now run as an authenticated proxy in HTTP proxy mode. Use
  --proxy-auth to provide a username and password that will be required
  of proxy users. Only the insecure (not encrypted) Basic authentication
  method is supported. [David]
</li><li>  Ndiff&#39;s text output has been redone to look more like Nmap output
  and be easier to read. See the Ndiff README file for an example. The
  XML output is now based on Nmap&#39;s XML output as well. Zenmap&#39;s diff
  viewer now shows the new output with syntax highlighting. [David]
</li><li>  The new versions of the Conficker Internet worm ban infected systems
  from visiting Insecure.Org and Nmap.Org.  We take that as a
  compliment to the effectiveness of our remote Conficker scanner.
  They also ban DNS substrings &quot;honey&quot; (for the Honeynet Project),
  &quot;doxpara&quot; (for Dan Kaminsky&#39;s site), &quot;tenablese&quot; for Tenable
  Security, &quot;coresecur&quot; for Core Security Technologies, and
  &quot;iv.cs.uni&quot; for those meddlesome (to the Conficker authors)
  researchers at the University of Bonn.  For people who can&#39;t reach
  nmap.org due to infection, I&#39;ve mirrored this release at
  <a href="http://sectools.org/nmap">http://sectools.org/nmap</a>/. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  New Conficker versions eliminate the loophole we were using to
  detect them with smb-check-vulns,nse, so we&#39;ve added new methods
  which work with the newest variants. Here are the Conficker-related
  improvements since BETA7:
<ul><li>Added new <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/p2p-conficker.html">p2p-conficker</a> script which detects Conficker using its
    P2P update ports rather than MSRPC.  This is based on some new
    research by Symantec. See
    <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/p2p-conficker.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/p2p-conficker.html</a> [Ron]
</li><li>Since new Conficker variants prevent detection by our previous
    MSRPC check in smb-check-vulns, we&#39;ve added a new check which still
    works. It involves calling netpathcanonicalize on &quot;\&quot; rather than
    &quot;\..\&quot; and checking for a different return value.  It was discovered
    by Felix Leder and Tillmann Werner. [Ron]
</li><li>Improved smb-check-vulns Conficker error message text to be more
    useful. [David]
</li><li>smb-check-vulns now defaults to using basic login rather than
    extended logins as this seems to work better on some
    machines. [Ron]
</li><li>Recommended command for a fast Conficker scan (combine into 1 line):
    nmap -p139,445 --script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/p2p-conficker.html">p2p-conficker</a>,<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html">smb-os-discovery</a>,smb-check-vulns
    --script-args checkconficker=1,safe=1 -T4 [target networks]
</li><li>Recommended command for a more comprehensive (but slower) scan:
    nmap --script <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/p2p-conficker.html">p2p-conficker</a>,<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html">smb-os-discovery</a>,smb-check-vulns -p-
    --script-args checkall=1,safe=1 -T4 [target networks]</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The Nmap Script Engine core (C++) was rewritten in Lua for
  code simplicity and extensibility. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0090.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0090.html</a> and
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0047.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0047.html</a> . [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The &quot;Cancel&quot; button has been restored to the main screen.
  It will cancel the scan that is currently being displayed. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed an SMB library bug which could case a nil-pointer exception
  when scanning broken SMB implementations. Reported by Steve
  Horejsi. [Ron]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> The setup.py installation script now suggests installing the
  python-dev package in a certain error situation. Previously the
  error message it printed was misleading:
<pre>
    error: invalid Python installation: unable to open
    /usr/lib/python2.6/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)
</pre>  The change was suggested by Aaron Leininger. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Nbase]</span> The checksum functions now have an nbase_ prefix.  This
  should prevent name collisions with internal but exported functions
  in shared libraries Nmap links against (e.g. adler32() in zlib).
  Such collisions seem to confuse the runtime linker on some platforms.
  [Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  Fixed <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/banner.html">banner</a>.nse to remove surrounding whitespace from banners. For
  example, this avoids a superfluous carriage return and newline at the
  end of SSH greetings. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Expanded and tweaked the product/version/info of service scans in an
  attempt to reduce the number of warnings like &quot;Warning: Servicescan
  failed to fill info_template...&quot;.  Parts of this change include:
<ul><li>Improved the text of the warning to be less confusing
</li><li>Increased the internal version info buffer to 256 chars from 128
</li><li>Increased the final version string length to 160 from 128 chars
</li><li>Changed the behavior when constructing the final version string so
    that if it runs out of space, rather than dropping the output of that
    template it truncates the template with ...
</li><li>Fixed the printing of unneeded spaces between templates when one of the
    templates isn&#39;t going to be printed at all.</li></ul>
  [Brandon]
</li><li>  Improved the service scan DB to remove certain problematic regex
  patterns which could lead to PCRE_MATCHLIMIT errors. For example,
  instances of &quot;.*\r\n.*&quot; and &quot;.*\n.*\n&quot; were generally collapsed to
  &quot;.*&quot; as long as the DOTALL (/s) modifier was set. [Brandon]
</li><li>  Changed some error() calls (which were more informational than error
  messages) to use log_write() instead, and changed a few f?printf()
  calls into error() or log_write(). [Brandon]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed a bug in the resolve() function which could cause Ncat
  to resolve names using the wrong address family (such as AF_INET
  rather than AF_INET6) in some rare cases. [Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Worked around a GTK+ bug on Windows reported by Henry Nymann.
  It caused a crash when opening the Hosts Viewer on a host that had OS
  information. A window appeared saying simply &quot;Runtime Error!&quot;. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Gracefully handle unrecognized port states in the hosts
  viewer. Apparently old versions of Nmap can return a state of
  &quot;unknown&quot;. This prevents this crash:
<pre>
      File &quot;radialnet\gui\NodeNotebook.pyo&quot;, line 107, in __init__
      File &quot;radialnet\gui\NodeNotebook.pyo&quot;, line 257, in __create_widgets
    KeyError: u&#39;unknown&#39;
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  Rewrote the debugging error message &quot;Found whacked packet protocol
  17 in get_ping_pcap_result&quot; because we decided that receiving a UDP
  packet during TCP ping scan is not egregious enough to qualify as
  &quot;whacked&quot;. [David]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.85BETA7 [2009-04-1] <a class="versionlink" id="4.85BETA7" href="#4.85BETA7" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Improvements to the Conficker detection script (smb-check-vulns):
<ul><li>Reduce false negative rate.  We (and all the other scanners) used
    to require the 0x57 return code as well as a canonicalized path
    string including 0x5c450000.  Tenable confirmed an infected system
    which returned a 0x00000000 path, so we now treat any hosting
    returning code 0x57 as likely infected. [Ron]
</li><li>Add workaround for crash in older versions of OpenSSL which would
    occur when we received a blank authentication challenge string
    from the server.  The error looked like: evp_enc.c(282): OpenSSL
    internal error, assertion failed: inl &gt; 0&quot;. [Ron]
</li><li>Add helpful text for the two most common errors seen in the
    Conficker check in smb-check-vulns.nse.  So instead of saying
    things like &quot;Error: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED&quot;, output is like:
    |  Conficker: Likely CLEAN; access was denied.
    |  |  If you have a login, try using --script-args=smbuser=xxx,smbpass=yyy
    |  |  (replace xxx and yyy with your username and password). Also try
    |  |_ smbdomain=zzz if you know the domain. (Error NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED)
    The other improved message is for
    NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND. [David]</li></ul>

</li><li>  The NSEDoc portal at <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc">https://nmap.org/nsedoc</a>/ now provides download
  links from the script and module pages to browse or download recent versions
  of the code.  It isn&#39;t quite as up-to-date as obtaining them from
  svn directly, but may be more convenient. For an example, see
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html</a> . [David, Fyodor]
</li><li>  A copy of the Nmap public svn repository (/nmap, plus its zenmap,
  nsock, nbase, and ncat externals) is now available at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/svn">https://nmap.org/svn</a>/.  We&#39;ll be updating this regularly, but it may
  be slightly behind the SVN version.  This is particularly useful
  when you need to link to files in the tree, since browsers generally
  don&#39;t handle svn:// repository links. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Declare a couple <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/msrpc.html">msrpc.lua</a> variables as local to avoid a potential
  deadlock between <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-server-stats.html">smb-server-stats</a>.nse instances. [Ron]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.85BETA6 [2009-03-31] <a class="versionlink" id="4.85BETA6" href="#4.85BETA6" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Fixed some bugs with the Conficker detection script
  (smb-check-vulns) [Ron]:
<ul><li>SMB response timeout raised to 20s from 5s to compensate for
    slow/overloaded systems and networks.
</li><li>MSRPC now only signs messages if OpenSSL is available (avoids an
    error).
</li><li>Better error checking for MS08-067 patch
</li><li>Fixed forgotten endian-modifier (caused problems on big-endian
    systems such as Solaris on SPARC).</li></ul>

</li><li>  Host status messages (up/down) are now uniform between ping scanning
  and port scanning and include more information. They used to vary
  slightly, but now all look like
<pre>
    Host &lt;host&gt; is up (Xs latency).
    Host &lt;host&gt; is down.
</pre>  The new latency information is Nmap&#39;s estimate of the round trip
  time. In addition, the reason for a host being up is now printed for
  port scans just as for ping scans, with the --reason option. [David]
</li><li>  Version detection now has a generic match line for SSLv3 servers,
  which matches more servers than the already-existing set of specific
  match lines. The match line found 13% more SSL servers in a test.
  Note that Nmap will not be able to do SSL scan-through against a
  small fraction of these servers, those that are SSLv3-only or
  TLSv1-only, because that ability is not yet built into Nsock. There
  is also a new version detection probe that works against SSLv2-only
  servers. These have shown themselves to be very rare, so that probe
  is not sent by default. Kristof Boeynaems provided the patch and did
  the testing.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> A typo that led to a crash if the ndiff subprocess
  terminated with an error was fixed. [David] The message was
<pre>
      File &quot;zenmapGUI\DiffCompare.pyo&quot;, line 331, in check_ndiff_process
    UnboundLocalError: local variable &#39;error_test&#39; referenced before assignment</pre>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> A crash was fixed:
<pre>
      File &quot;zenmapGUI\SearchGUI.pyo&quot;, line 582, in operator_changed
    KeyError: &quot;Syst\xc3\xa8me d&#39;Exploitation&quot;
</pre>  The text could be different, because the error was caused by
  translating a string that was also being used as an index into an
  internal data structure. The string will be untranslated until that
  part of the code can be rewritten. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> A bug was fixed that caused a crash when doing a keyword:
  or target: search over hosts that had a MAC address. [David]
  The crash output was
<pre>
      File &quot;zenmapCore\SearchResult.pyo&quot;, line 86, in match_keyword
      File &quot;zenmapCore\SearchResult.pyo&quot;, line 183, in match_target
    TypeError: argument of type &#39;NoneType&#39; is not iterable</pre>
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which prevented all comma-separated --script arguments
  from being shown in Nmap normal and XML output files where they show
  the original Nmap command. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed ping scanner&#39;s runtime statistics system so that instead of
  saying &quot;0 undergoing Ping Scan&quot; it gives the actual number of hosts in
  the group (e.g. 4096). [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> A crash was fixed in displaying the &quot;Error creating the
  per-user configuration directory&quot; dialog:
<pre>
      File &quot;zenmap&quot;, line 104, in &lt;module&gt;
      File &quot;zenmapGUI\App.pyo&quot;, line 129, in run
    UnicodeDecodeError: &#39;utf8&#39; codec can&#39;t decode bytes in position 43-45:
                        invalid data
</pre>  The crash would only happen to users with paths containing
  multibyte characters in a non-UTF-8 locale, who also had some error
  preventing the creation of the directory. [David]

<li>  Ron (in just a few hours of furious coding) added remote detection
  of the Conficker worm to smb-check-vulns. It is based on new
  research by Tillmann Werner and Felix Leder.  You can scan your
  network for Conficker with a command like: nmap -PN -T4 -p139,445 -n
  -v --script=smb-check-vulns --script-args safe=1 [targetnetworks]
</li><li>  Ndiff now includes service (version detection) and OS detection
  differences. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The --exec and --sh-exec options now work in UDP mode like
  they do in TCP mode: the server handles multiple concurrent clients
  and doesn&#39;t have to be restarted after each one. Marius Sturm
  provided the patch.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The -v option (used alone) no longer floods the screen with
  debugging messages. With just -v, we now only print the most
  important status messages such as &quot;Connected to ...&quot;, a startup
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/banner.html">banner</a>, and error messages.  At -vv, minor debugging messages are
  enabled, such as what command is being executed by --sh-exec.  With
  -vvv you get detailed debugging messages. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Chat mode now lets other participants know when someone
  connects or disconnects, and it also broadcasts a current list of
  participants at such times. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Fixed a socket handling bug which could occur when you
  redirect Ncat stdin, such as &quot;ncat -l --chat &lt; /dev/null&quot;.  The next
  user to connect would end up with file descriptor 0 (which is
  normally stdin) and thus confuse Ncat. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The &quot;Scan Output&quot; expanders in the diff window now behave
  more naturally. Some strange behavior on Windows was noted by Jah.
  [David]
</li><li>  The following OS detection tests are no longer included in OS
  fingerprints: U1.RUL, U1.TOS, IE.DLI, IE.SI, and IE.TOSI. URL, DLI,
  and SI were found not be helpful in distinguishing operating systems
  because they didn&#39;t vary. TOS and TOSI were disabled in 4.85BETA1
  but now they are not included in prints at all. [David]
</li><li>  The compile-time Nmap ASCII dragon is now more ferocious thanks to
  better teeth alignment. [David]
</li><li>  Version 4.85BETA4 had a bug in the implementation of the new SEQ.CI
  test that could cause a closed-port IP ID to be written into the
  array for the SEQ.TI test and cause erroneous results. The bug was
  found and fixed by Guillaume Prigent.
</li><li>  Nbase has grown routines for calculating Adler32 and CRC32C
  checksums. This is needed for future SCTP support. [Daniel
  Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Zenmap no longer shows an error message when running Nmap
  with options that cause a zero-length XML file to be produced (like
  --iflist). [David]
</li><li>  Fixed an off-by-one error in printableSize() which could cause Nmap
  to crash while reporting NSE results. Also, NmapOutputTable&#39;s memory
  allocation strategy was improved to conserve memory. [Brandon,
  Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> We now give the --force option to setup.py for installation
  to ensure that it replaces all files. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s --packet-trace, --version-trace, and --script-trace now use
  an Nsock trace level of 2 rather than 5.  This removes some
  superfluous lines which can flood the screen. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash which could occur when loading the help URL
  if the path contains multibyte characters. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The version number is now matched to the Nmap release it came
  with rather than always being 0.2. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a strtok issue between load_exclude and
  TargetGroup::parse_expr that caused only the first exclude on
  a line to be loaded as well as an invalid read into free()&#39;d
  memory in load_exclude(). [Brandon, David]
</li><li>  NSE&#39;s garbage collection system (for cleaning up sockets from
  completed threads, etc.) has been improved. [Patrick]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.85BETA4 [2009-3-15] <a class="versionlink" id="4.85BETA4" href="#4.85BETA4" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Added two new SMB/MSRPC NSE scripts by Ron Bowes:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-brute.html">smb-brute</a>.nse: Bruteforce to discover SMB accounts. Has advanced
    features, such as lockout detection, username validation, username
    enumeration, and optimized case detection.
</li><li>smb-pwdump.nse: Uses executables from the Pwdump6 project to dump
    password hashes from a remote machine (and optionally crack them
    with Rainbow Crack). Pwdump6 files have to be downloaded
    separately</li></ul>

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The --exec and --sh-exec options now work on Windows. This
  was a big job, considering that Windows doesn&#39;t even have a fork()
  call and has all sorts of socket idiosyncrasies. [David]
</li><li>  Doug performed one of the largest version detection integration runs
  ever, processing 1,746 submissions and 18 corrections.  We are now
  current with all submissions up to February 3.  Keep them coming.
  The version detection database has grown to 5,476 signatures for 510
  application protocols. Doug posted his notes on the integration at
  <a href="http://hcsw.org/blog.pl/37">http://hcsw.org/blog.pl/37</a>.  We now have 1,868 http server
  signatures, and the number of gopher signatures has bumped up from 5
  to 6.
</li><li>  Released the new Ncat guide which contains practical real-life Ncat
  usage examples for Ncat&#39;s major features.  It complements the more
  option-centric man page.  Read it here: <a href="https://nmap.org/ncat/guide">https://nmap.org/ncat/guide</a>/
  [David, Fyodor]
</li><li>  Ndiff is now included in the Windows zip distribution. For space
  reasons, it is not an executable compiled with py2exe as in the
  executable installer, rather it is the Ndiff source code (ndiff.py)
  and a batch file wrapper (ndiff.bat). Because it&#39;s not precompiled,
  it&#39;s necessary to have a Python interpreter installed. [David]
</li><li>  The new --stats-every option takes a time interval that controls how
  often timing status updates are printed. It&#39;s intended to be used
  when Nmap is run by another program as a subprocess. Thanks to
  Aleksandar Petrinic for the initial implementation. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> A new function stdnse.sleep allows a script to sleep for a
  given time (and yield control to other scripts). [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> In --chat mode (formerly --talk), the server now announces to
  everyone when someone connects or disconnects. Besides letting you
  know who&#39;s connected, this also informs you of your &quot;user name&quot; as
  soon as you connect. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Ncat now works interactively on Windows. Before,
  peculiarities in the way Windows handles reading from the keyboard
  meant that typing interactively into Ncat would cause it to quit
  with a write timeout. [David]
</li><li>  Refactored SMB and MSRPC NSE scripts significantly, moving much of
  the code into the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/smb.html">smb.lua</a> and <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/msrpc.html">msrpc.lua</a> modules where it can be
  leveraged by other scripts. For example, the user enumeration
  functions are used by <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-brute.html">smb-brute</a>.nse. [Ron Bowes]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The syntax accepted by the --allow, --deny, --allowfile, and
  --denyfile options is now the same as Nmap&#39;s target specifications.
  Additionally any errors in the allow or deny specifications are
  reported when the program starts, not deferred until a connection is
  received. [David]
</li><li>  You can now use &#39;-&#39; by itself in a target IP specification to mean
  0-255, so you could scan 192.168.-.-.  An asterisk can also still be
  used as an octet wildcard, but then you have to deal with shell
  escaping on many platforms. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap was discovered in another movie!  In the Russian film
  Khottabych, teenage hacker Gena uses Nmap (and telnet) to hack
  Microsoft.  In response, MS sends a pretty female hacker to flush
  him out.  More details and screenshots: <a href="https://nmap.org/movies/#khottabych">https://nmap.org/movies/#khottabych</a> .
</li><li>  Improved operating system support for the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-sessions.html">smb-enum-sessions</a> NSE
  script; previous revisions worked on Windows 2003 or Windows 2000,
  but never both.  Currently, it is tested and working on both
  versions.  [Ron Bowes]
</li><li>  Implemented file-management functions in SMB, including file upload,
  file download, and file delete. Only leverages by smb-pwdump.nse at
  the moment, these functions give scripts the ability to perform
  checks against the filesystem of a server. [Ron Bowes]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> A crash was fixed that occurred when you ran a scan
  that didn&#39;t produce any host output (like &quot;nmap --iflist&quot;) and then
  tried to remove it from the inventory. [David]
  The crash looked like
<pre>
    ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list</pre>
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> In --chat mode, the server escapes potentially dangerous
  control characters (in octal) before sending them to
  clients. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ndiff]</span> Added a workaround for a bug in PyXML. The bug would cause a
  crash that looked like &quot;KeyError: 0&quot;. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash when something that looked like a format
  specifier (like %y) appeared in a profile. The error message was
<pre>
    ValueError: unsupported format character &#39;y&#39; (0x79)
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  A bug was fixed in route finding on BSD Unix. The libdnet function
  addr_stob didn&#39;t handle the special case of the sa_len member of
  struct sockaddr being equal to 0 and accessed unrelated memory past
  the end of the sockaddr. A symptom of this was the fatal error
<pre>
    nexthost: failed to determine route to ...
</pre>  which was caused by the default route being assigned a netmask other
  than 0.0.0.0. [David]
</li><li>  Added bindings for the service control (SVCCTL) and at service (ATSVC)
  services. These are both related to running processes on the remote
  system (identical to how PsExec-style scripts work). These bindings
  are used by smb-pwdump.nse. [Ron Bowes]
</li><li>  Refactored SMB authentication code into its own module, <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/smbauth.html">smbauth.lua</a>.
  Improved scripts&#39; ability to store and retrieve login information
  discovered by modules such as <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-brute.html">smb-brute</a>.nse. [Ron Bowes]
</li><li>  Added message signing to SMB. Connections will no longer fail if the
  server requires message signatures. This is a rare case, but comes up
  on occasion. If a server allows but doesn&#39;t require message signing,
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/smb.html">smb.lua</a> will negotiate signing. This improves security by preventing
  man in the middle attacks. [Ron Bowes]
</li><li>  Fixed the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/daytime.html">daytime</a>.nse script to work for UDP again (it was checking
  a &quot;proto&quot; field when the field name is actually &quot;protocol&quot;). [Jah]
</li><li>  Implemented extended security negotiations in the NSE SMB
  module. Creates no noticeable change from the user&#39;s perspective,
  but it&#39;s a more modern protocol. [Ron Bowes]
</li><li>  Nmap wins LinuxQuestions.Org Network Security Application of the
  Year for the sixth year in a row! See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0395.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0395.html</a> .
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Removed some unnecessary (mostly GTK+-related) files from
  the Windows installer--nmap-4.85BETA4-setup.exe is now smaller than
  it has ever been since Nmap 4.22SOC6, which was released in August
  2007! [David]
</li><li>  Fixed the install-zenmap make target for Solaris portability.
  Solaris /bin/sh does not have test(1) -e. [Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  Version detection used to omit the &quot;ssl/&quot; service name prefix if an
  SSL-tunneled port didn&#39;t respond to any version probes. Now it keeps
  &quot;ssl/&quot; as an indication that SSL was discovered, even if the service
  behind it wasn&#39;t identified. Kristof Boeynaems reported the problem
  and contributed a patch. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The --talk option has been renamed --chat. --talk remains as an
  undocumented alias.
</li><li>  There is a new OS detection test named SEQ.CI. Like TI and II, CI
  classifies the target&#39;s IP ID sequence generation algorithm. CI is
  based on the responses received to the probes sent to a closed port.
  The algorithm for closed ports has been observed to differ from that
  for open ports on some operating systems (though we don&#39;t yet know
  which ones).  The new test won&#39;t have an effect until new
  fingerprints containing it are added to nmap-os-db. We got the idea
  from some notes sent in by Dario Ciccarone. [David, Fyodor]
</li><li>  OS fingerprints now include the SEQ.II test (ICMP IP ID sequence
  generation) even if there are no other SEQ test results. The
  previous omission of SEQ.II in that case was a bug. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The --send-only and --recv-only options now work in listen
  mode as well as connect mode. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> An error in formatting bytes with the high bit set in hex
  dump output was fixed. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> New translation: Croatian (contributed by Vlatko Kosturjak).
</li><li>  Fixed a DNS decoding bug in <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-zone-transfer.html">dns-zone-transfer</a>.nse that created
  garbage output and could crash Zenmap by including 0x0C bytes in XML
  files. The Zenmap crash looked like
<pre>
    SAXParseException: .../zenmap-XXXXXX.xml:39:290: not well-formed
    (invalid token)
</pre>  Thanks to Anino Belan and Eric Nickel for sending in affected log
  files. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSEDoc]</span> Scripts that use modules automatically have the script
  arguments defined by those modules included in their documentation.
  It&#39;s no longer necessary to manually supply @args for the arguments
  in the modules you use. For those who haven&#39;t seen the NSEDoc portal
  yet, check out <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc">https://nmap.org/nsedoc</a>/. [David]
</li><li>  An integer overflow in the scan progress meter was fixed. It caused
  nonsense output like
<pre>
    UDP Scan Timing: About 11.34% done; ETC: 03:21 (-688:-41:-48 remaining)
</pre>  during very long scans. [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> A better method of detecting the system locale is used, so
  it should not be necessary to set the LANG environment variable on
  Windows to get internationalized text. Thanks to Dirk Loss for the
  suggestion. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Added a number of automated tests for ensuring that Ncat is
  working correctly.  They are in /ncat/test in SVN. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> Now builds again when using the --without-openssl
  option. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fix auto-scroll behavior while Nmap is producing output, as
  that previously failed in some cases involving wide lines in
  output. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The network topology feature (Radialnet) has been
  internationalized so its strings will be localized as well (as soon
  as the relevant language&#39;s translation files are updated.  To help
  out, see <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-lang.html">https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-lang.html</a> . Some remaining search
  interface elements were internationalized as well. [David]
</li><li>  Improved the efficiency of the xml_convert() routine which handles
  XML escaping.  It was so inefficient that this stupid little routine
  was noticeably slowing Nmap down in some cases. [David]
</li><li>  Removed 9 OS detection device types which only had one or two
  instances in our whole database (ATM, TV, oscilloscope, etc.) and
  made some other cleanups as well. We plan to enhance this even
  further for the next release. [Fyodor, David, Doug]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Removed some unnecessary GTK+ files from the files
  installed by the Windows executable installer. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Tweaked the file format of the topology icons
  (firewall.png, padlock.png, etc.) in an attempt to improve
  compatibility with some versions of GTK+. This may fix a crash like
<pre>
    File &quot;radialnet/gui/Image.py&quot;, line 53, in get_pixbuf
      self.__cache[icon + image_type] = gtk.gdk.pixbuf_new_from_file(file)
    GError: Couldn&#39;t recognize the image file format for file &#39;radialnet/padlock.png&#39;
</pre>  Thanks to Trevor Bain for a report and help debugging. [David]
</li><li>  Removed a bunch of unnecessary files (mostly GTK related) from the
  Win32 exe installer to reduce its size. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed an NSE crash (assertion error) which looked like
  &quot;nsock_core.c:293: handle_connect_result: Assertion `0&#39;
  failed&quot;. Brandon reported the bug, which was fixed by Doug and
  David.  See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0546.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0546.html</a> .

<li>  Revert the temporary GTK DLL workaround (r11899) which added
  duplicate DLL files to the distribution.  David found that using a
  different GTK download fixed the problem (see
  docs/win32-installer-zenmap-buildguide.txt) and Fyodor was able to
  reproduce and implement.
</li><li>  The conditions for printing OS fingerprints to XML output are now
  the same as are used to decide whether to print them in the other
  formats. So they will be printed if submission is desirable,
  otherwise they are only printed if debugging is enabled or verbosity
  is 2 or higher. [Tom Sellers]
</li><li>  Removed some Brazilian poetry/lyrics from Zenmap source code
  (NmapOutputViewer.py). We&#39;ve seen enough of it in the debug logs. &quot;E
  nao se entrega, nao&quot;.
</li><li>  Fix Ncat compilation with the MingW windows compiler. [Gisle Vanem]
</li><li>  Corrected some NSE libraries (datafiles, tab) which were using the
  old arg table interface. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash that happened when running a scan directly

<li>  Added Ncat, a much-improved reimplementation of the venerable Netcat
  tool which adds modern features and makes use of Nmap&#39;s efficient
  networking libraries.  Features include SSL support, proxy
  connections (client or server, socks4 or connect-based, with or
  without authentication, optionally chained), TCP and UDP connection
  redirection, connection brokering (facilitating connections between
  machines which are behind NAT gateways), and much more.  It is
  cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac, etc.) and supports IPv6 as well
  as standard IPv4.  See <a href="https://nmap.org/ncat">https://nmap.org/ncat</a>/ for details.  It is now
  included in our binary packages (Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X), and
  built by default.  You can skip it with the --without-ncat configure
  option.  Thanks to Kris and David for their great work on this!
</li><li>  Added the Ndiff utility, which compares the results of two Nmap
  scans and describes the new/removed hosts, newly open/closed ports,
  changed operating systems, etc.  This makes it trivial to scan your
  networks on a regular basis and create a report (XML or text format)
  on all the changes.  See <a href="https://nmap.org/ndiff">https://nmap.org/ndiff</a>/ and ndiff/README for
  more information. Ndiff is included in our binary packages and built
  by default, though you can prevent it from being built by specifying
  the --without-ndiff configure flag.  Thanks to David and Michael
  Pattrick for their great work on this.
</li><li>  Released Nmap Network Scanning: The Official Nmap Project Guide to
  Network Discovery and Security Scanning.  From explaining port
  scanning basics for novices to detailing low-level packet crafting
  methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits all levels of
  security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference guide
  documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the book
  demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve real-world
  tasks.  It was briefly the #1 selling computer book on Amazon.
  Translations to the German, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese
  languages are forthcoming.  More than half of the book is already
  free online.  For more, see <a href="https://nmap.org/book/.">https://nmap.org/book/.</a>
</li><li>  David spent more than a month working on algorithms to improve port
  scan performance while retaining or improving accuracy.  The changes
  are described at <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0054.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0054.html</a> . He
  was able to reduce our &quot;benchmark scan time&quot; (which involves many
  different scan types from many source networks to many targets) from
  1879 seconds to 1321 without harming accuracy.  That is a 30% time
  reduction!
</li><li>  Introduced the NSE documentation portal, which documents every NSE
  script and library included with Nmap. See <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc">https://nmap.org/nsedoc</a>/.
  Script documentation was improved substantially in the process.
  Scripts and libraries must use the new NSEDoc format, which is
  described at <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nsedoc.html">https://nmap.org/book/nsedoc.html</a> .  Thanks to Patrick
  and David for their great work on this.
</li><li>  The 2nd Generation OS Detection System was dramatically improved for
  improved accuracy.  After substantial testing, David and Fyodor made
  the following changes:
<ul><li>The &quot;T&quot; (TTL test) result ranges were widened to prevent minor
    routing (and device hardware inconsistency) variations from causing
    so many matches to fail.
</li><li>The TG (TTL guess) results were canonicalized. Nmap is only
    capable of assigning the values 0x20, 0x40, 0x80, and 0xFF for
    these tests, yet many fingerprints had different values.  This was
    due to bugs in our fingerprint integration tools.
</li><li>The U1.TOS and IE.TOSI tests (both having to do with the IP Type
    of Service field) have been effectively eliminated (MatchPoints
    set to 0).  These proved particularly susceptible to false results
    due to networking hardware along the packet route manipulating the
    TOS header field.
</li><li>An important bug in OS detection&#39;s congestion control algorithms
    was fixed.  It could lead to Nmap sending packets much too quickly
    in some cases, which hurt accuracy.</li></ul>

</li><li>  Integrated all of your OS detection fingerprint submissions and
  corrections up to January 8.  The DB has grown more than 17% to
  1,761 fingerprints.  Newly detected services include Mac OS X
  10.5.6, Linux 2.6.28, iPhone 2.1, and all manner of WAPs, VoIP
  phones, routers, oscilloscopes, employee timeclocks, etc. Keep those
  submissions coming!
</li><li>  Ron Bowes embarked on a massive MSRPC/NETBIOS project to allow Nmap
  to interrogate Windows machines much more completely.  He added
  three new nselib modules: msrpc, netbios, and smb. As the names
  suggest, they contain common code for scripts using MSRPC, NetBIOS,
  and SMB. These modules allow scripts to extract a great deal of
  information from hosts running Windows, particularly Windows
  2000. New or updated scripts using the modules are:
<ul><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nbstat.html">nbstat</a>.nse: get NetBIOS names and MAC address.
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-domains.html">smb-enum-domains</a>.nse: enumerate domains and policies.
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-processes.html">smb-enum-processes</a>.nse: allows a user with administrator
    credentials to view a tree of the processes running on the
    remote system (uses HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA hive).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-sessions.html">smb-enum-sessions</a>.nse: enumerate logins and SMB sessions.
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-shares.html">smb-enum-shares</a>.nse: enumerate network shares.
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-users.html">smb-enum-users</a>.nse: enumerate users and information about them.
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html">smb-os-discovery</a>.nse: get operating system over SMB (replaces
    netbios-<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html">smb-os-discovery</a>.nse).
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-security-mode.html">smb-security-mode</a>.nse: determine if a host uses user-level or
    share-level security, and what other security features it
    supports.
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-server-stats.html">smb-server-stats</a>.nse: grab statistics such as network traffic
    counts.
</li><li><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-system-info.html">smb-system-info</a>.nse: get lots of information from the registry.</li></ul>

</li><li>  A problem that caused OS detection to fail for most hosts in a
  certain case was fixed. It happened when sending raw Ethernet frames
  (by default on Windows or on other platforms with --send-eth) to
  hosts on a switched LAN. The destination MAC address was wrong for
  most targets. The symptom was that only one out of each scan group
  of 20 or 30 hosts would have a meaningful OS fingerprint. Thanks go
  to Michael Head for running tests and especially Trent Snyder for
  testing and finding the cause of the problem. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap now runs ndiff to for its &quot;Compare Results&quot; function. This
  completely replaces the old diff view. The diff window size is now
  more flexible for user resizing as well. [David]
</li><li>  Added a Russian translation of the Nmap Reference Guide by Guz
  Alexander. We now have translations in 15 languages available from
  <a href="https://nmap.org/docs.html">https://nmap.org/docs.html</a> . More volunteer translators are welcome,
  as we are still missing some important languages. Translation
  instructions are available from that docs.html page.
</li><li>  Update Windows installer to handle Windows 7 (tested with the Beta
  build 7000) [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  Improved port scan performance by changing the list of high priority
  ports which Nmap shifts closer to the beginning of scans because
  they are more likely to be responsive.  We based the change on
  empirical data from large-scale scanning.  The new port list is:
<pre>
    21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 111, 113, 135, 139, 143, 199, 256,
    443, 445, 554, 587, 993, 995, 1025, 1720, 1723, 3306, 3389, 5900,
    8080, 8888
</pre>  [Fyodor, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Almost all scripts were renamed to be more consistent.  They
  are now all lowercase and most of them start with the name of the
  service name they query.  Words are separated by hyphens. [David,
  Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Now that scripts are better named, the &quot;Id&quot; field has been
  removed and the script name (sans the .nse or directory path
  information) is used in script output instead. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/banner.html">banner</a>.nse, a simple script which connects to open TCP
  ports and prints out anything sent in the first five seconds by the
  listening service. [Jah]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Added a new OpenSSL library with functions for multiprecision
  integer arithmetic, hashing, HMAC, symmetric encryption and
  symmetric decryption. [Sven]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Internationalization has been fixed [David]. Currently
  Zenmap has two translations:
<ul><li>German by Chris Leick
</li><li>Brazilian Portuguese by Adriano Monteiro Marques (partial)</li></ul>
  For details on using an existing translation or localizing Zenmap
  into your own native language, see
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-lang.html">https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-lang.html</a> . [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap no longer outputs XML elements and attributes that are not in
  the Nmap XML DTD. This was done mostly by removing things from
  Zenmap&#39;s output, and adding a few new optional things to the Nmap
  DTD. A scan&#39;s profile name, host comments, and interactive text
  output are what were added to nmap.dtd. The .usr filename extension
  for saved Zenmap files is deprecated in favor of the .xml extension
  commonly used with Nmap. Because of these changes the
  xmloutputversion has been increased to 1.03. [David]
</li><li>  The NSE registry now persists across host groups so that values
  stored in it will remain until they are explicitly removed or Nmap
  execution ends. [David]
</li><li>  Enhanced the AS Numbers script (ASN.nse) to better consolidate
  results and bail out if the DNS server doesn&#39;t support the ASN
  queries. [Jah]
</li><li>  Complete re-write of the marshaling logic for Microsoft RPC calls.
  [Ron Bowes]
</li><li>  Added a script that checks for ms08-067-vulnerable hosts
  (smb-check-vulns.nse) using the smb nselib. It also checks for an
  unfixed denial of service vulnerability Ron discovered in the
  Windows 2000 registry service. [Ron Bowes]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Text size is larger on Mac OS X thanks to a new included
  gtkrc file. [David]
</li><li>  Reduced memory consumption for some longer-running scans by removing
  completed hosts from the lists after two minutes.  These hosts are
  kept around in case there is a late response, but this draws the
  line on how long we wait and hence keep this information in memory.
  See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0902.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0902.html</a> for more. [Kris]
</li><li>  The Windows installer now uses Zenmap binaries built using Python
  2.6.1 rather than 2.5.1 [Fyodor]
</li><li>  When a system route can&#39;t be matched up directly with an interface
  by comparing addresses, Nmap now tries to match the route through
  another route. This helps for instance with a PPP connection where
  the default route&#39;s gateway address is routed through a different
  route, the one associated with the address of the PPP device. The
  problem would show itself as an inability to scan through the
  default route and the error message
<pre>
    WARNING: Unable to find appropriate interface for system route to ...
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  Removed a code comment which simply declared /* WANKER ALERT! */ for
  no good reason. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  NSE prints messages in debugging mode whenever a script starts or
  finishes. [Patrick, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Ncat]</span> The -l option can now be specified w/o a port number to
  listen on Ncat&#39;s default port number (31337).
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The Nmap output window now scrolls automatically as a scan
  progresses. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> We now have a canonical way for scripts to check for
  dependency libraries such as OpenSSL.  This allows them to handle
  the issue gracefully (by exiting or doing some of their work if
  possible) rather than flooding the console with error messages as
  before. See <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/openssl.html">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/openssl.html</a> . [Pattrick,
  David, Fyodor]
</li><li>  Nmap now reports a proper error message when you combine an IPv6
  scan (-6) with random IPv4 address selection (-iR). [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  Nmap now builds with the _FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 define.  With modern
  versions of GCC, this adds extra buffer overflow protection and
  other security checks.  It is described at
  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html</a> . [David,
  Doug]
</li><li>  The --excludefile option correctly handles files with no terminating
  newline instead of claiming &quot;Exclude file line 0 was too long to
  read.&quot; [Henri Doreau]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Changed the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/datafiles.html">datafiles</a> library to remove constraining input
  checks, move nmap.fetch_file() to read_from_file(), and make
  get_array() and get_assoc_array() into normal functions. [Sven]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed some bugs and typos in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/datafiles.html">datafiles</a> library. [Jah]
</li><li>  Nsock handles a certain Windows connect error, WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL
  (errno 10049), preventing an assertion failure that looked like
<pre>
    Strange connect error from 203.65.42.255 (10049): No such file or directory
    Assertion failed: 0, file .\src\nsock_core.c, line 290
</pre>  The error could be seen by running a version scan against a
  broadcast address. Thanks to Tilo K&ouml;ppe and James Liu for reporting
  the problem. [David]
</li><li>  An &quot;elapsed&quot; attribute has been added to the XML output (in the
  &quot;finished&quot; tag), representing the total Nmap scanning time in
  seconds (floating point). [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a division by zero error in the packet rate measuring code
  that could cause a display of infinity packets per seconds near the
  start of a scan. [Jah]
</li><li>  Substantially updated the Nmap Scripting Engine guide/chapter
  (<a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse.html">https://nmap.org/book/nse.html</a>) so that it is up-to-date with all
  the latest NSE improvements.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in the IP validation code which would have let a specially
  crafted reply sent from a host on the same LAN slip through and cause
  Nmap to segfault.  Thanks to ithilgore of sock-raw.homeunix.org for
  the very detailed bug report. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The crash reporter further enhances user privacy by showing
  all the information that will be submitted so you can edit it to
  remove identifying information such as the name of your home
  directory. If you provide an email address the report will be marked
  private so it will not appear on the public bug tracker. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Zenmap now parses and records XSL stylesheet information
  from Nmap XML files, so files saved by Zenmap will be viewable in a
  web browser just like those produced by Nmap. [David]
</li><li>  A possible Lua stack overflow in the DNS module was fixed. Lua detects
  these sorts of overflows and quits. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Improved html-title script to support http-alt and https-alt
  (with SSL) and to handle a wider variety of redirects. [Jah]
</li><li>  NSE scripts that require a list of DNS servers (currently only
  ASN.nse) now work when IPv6 scanning. Previously it gave an error
  message: &quot;Failed to send dns query.  Response from dns.query(): 9&quot;.
  [Jah, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added a workaround for a crash
<pre>
    GtkWarning: could not open display
</pre>  on Mac OS X 10.5. The problem is caused by setting the DISPLAY
  environment variable in one of your shell startup files; that
  shouldn&#39;t be done under 10.5 and removing it will make other
  X11-using applications work better. Zenmap will now handle the
  situation automatically. [David]
</li><li>  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-auth.html">http-auth</a>.nse now properly checks for default authentication
  credentials. A bug prevented it from working before. [Vlatko
  Kosturjak]
</li><li>  Renamed irc-zombie.nse to <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/auth-spoof.html">auth-spoof</a> and improved its description
  and output a bit. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Removed some unnecessary &quot;demo&quot; category NSE scripts: echoTest,
  chargenTest, showHTTPVersion, and showSMTPVersion.nse.  Moved
  daytimeTest from the &quot;demo&quot; category to &quot;discovery&quot;.  Removed
  showHTMLTitle from the &quot;demo&quot; category, but it remains in the
  &quot;default&quot; and &quot;safe&quot; categories. This leaves just <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-open-relay.html">smtp-open-relay</a> in
  the undocumented &quot;demo&quot; category. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Removed ripeQuery.nse because we now have the much more robust
  whois.nse which handles all the major registries. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Removed showSSHVersion.nse. Its only real claim to fame was
  the ability to trick some SSH servers (including at least OpenSSH
  4.3p2-9etch3) into not logging the connection.  This trick doesn&#39;t
  seem to work with newer versions of OpenSSH, as my
  openssh-server-4.7p1-4.fc8 does log the connection. Without the
  stealth advantage, the script has no real benefit over version
  detection or the upcoming <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/banner.html">banner</a> grabbing script. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Profile updates: The -sS option was added to the &quot;Intense
  scan plus UDP&quot; and &quot;Slow comprehensive scan&quot; profiles.  The -PN (ping
  only) option was added to &quot;Quick traceroute&quot;. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-commands.html">smtp-commands</a> script output is now more compact. [Jasey
  DePriest, David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added a simple workaround for a bug in PyXML (an add-on
  Python XML library) that caused a crash. The crash would happen when
  loading an XML file and looked like &quot;KeyError: 0&quot;. [David]
</li><li>  A crash caused by an incorrect test condition was fixed. It would
  happen when running a ping scan other than a protocol ping, without
  debugging enabled, if an ICMP packet was received referring to a
  packet that was not TCP, UDP, or ICMP. Thanks to Brandon Enright and
  Matt Castelein for reporting the problem. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The keyboard shortcut for &quot;Save to Directory&quot; has been
  changed from Ctrl+v to Ctrl+Alt+s so as not to conflict with the
  usual paste shortcut. [Jah, Michael]
</li><li>  Nmap now quits if you give a &quot;backwards&quot; port or protocol range like
  -p 20-10. The issue was noted by Arturo &quot;Buanzo&quot; Busleiman. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which caused Nmap to infer an improper distance against
  some hosts when performing OS detection against a group whose
  distance varies between members. [David, Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Host information windows are now like any other windows,
  and will not become unclosable by having their controls offscreen.
  Thanks to Robert Mead for the bug report.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> showHTMLTitle can now follow (non-standard) relative
  redirects, and may do a DNS lookup to find if the redirected-to host
  has the same IP address as the scanned host. [Jah]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Enhanced the tohex() function in the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/stdnse.html">stdnse</a> library to support
  strings and added options to control the formatting. [Sven]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The http module tries to deal with non-standards-compliant
  HTTP traffic, particularly responses in which the header fields are
  separated by plain LF rather than CRLF. [Jah, Sven]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The help function now properly converts the pathname of the
  local help file to a URL, for better compatibility with different
  web browsers. [David]
  This should fix the crash
  WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified:
  &#39;file://C:\\Program Files\\Nmap\\zenmap\\share\\zenmap\\docs\\help.html&#39;
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a number of small bugs in the Nmap library
  (nse_nmaplib.cc), as described at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q4/0663.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q4/0663.html</a> [Patrick]
</li><li>  The HTTP_open_proxy.nse script was updated to match Google Web
  Server&#39;s changed header field: &quot;Server: gws&quot; instead of
  &quot;Server: GWS/&quot;.  [Vlatko Kosturjak]
</li><li>  Enhanced the ssh service detection signatures to properly
  detect protocol version 2 services. [Matt Selsky]
</li><li>  Nsock now uses fselect() to work around problems with select() not
  working properly on non-socket descriptors on Windows.  This was
  needed for Ncat to work properly on that platform. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0766.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0766.html</a> . [Kris]
</li><li>  Removed trailing null bytes from Ncat&#39;s responses in HTTP proxy
  mode. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/daytime.html">daytime</a>.nse now runs against TCP ports in addition to the UDP
  ports it already handled. The output format was also
  improved. [David]
</li><li>  XML output now contains the full path to nmap.xml on Windows. The
  path is converted to a file:// URL to provide better compatibility
  across browsers. [Jah]
</li><li>  Made DNS timeouts in NSE a bit more aggressive at higher timing
  levels such as -T4 and -T5. [Jah]
</li><li>  A script could be executed twice if it was given with the --script
  option, also in the &quot;version&quot; category, and version detection (-sV)
  was requested. This has been fixed. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed port number representation in some Nmap and Nsock message
  output.  Incorrect conversion modifiers caused high ports to wrap
  around and be shown as negative values. [Kris]
</li><li>  Upgraded the shipped libdnet library to version 1.12 (with our
  modifications). [Kris]
</li><li>  Upgraded the OpenSSL binaries shipped in our Windows installer to
  version 0.9.8i. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The SSLv2-support script no longer prints duplicate cyphers if
  they exist in the server&#39;s supported cypher list. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fix compilation w/IPv6 support on Solaris by checking for inet_addr
  in -lnsr before using APR_CHECK_WORKING_GETNAMEINFO in
  configure. [David]
</li><li>  Removed the nbase_md5.* and nbase_sha1.* files because our
  new nse_openssl library includes that functionality. [David]
</li><li>  The robots.txt NSE script is now silent when there are no
  interesting results, rather than printing that robots.txt &quot;is empty
  or has no disallowed entries&quot;. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a file (socket) descriptor leak which could occur when connect
  scan probes receive certain unusual error messages (including
  EHOSTUNREACH, and EHOSTDOWN). This led to error messages such as
  &quot;Socket creation in sendConnectScanProbe: Too many open files (24)&quot;
  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Made floating host details windows into normal top-level
  windows. This avoids a problem where the edge of a window could be
  off the edge of a screen and it would not be closable. The bug was
  reported by Robert Mead. [David]
</li><li>  Use TIMEVAL_AFTER(...) instead of TIMEVAL_SUBTRACT(...) &gt; 0 when
  deciding whether a probe response counts as a drop for scan delay
  purposes.  This prevents an integer overflow which could
  substantially degrade scan performance. [David]
</li><li>  Reorganized macosx/Makefile to make it easier to add in new packages
  such as Ncat and Ndiff. Also removed the bogus clean-nmap and
  clean-zenmap targets. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash related to the use of NmapOptions in
  ScanNotebook.py using the old interface (ops.num_random_targes,
  ops.input_filename) rather than the newer dict-style
  interface. [Jah]
</li><li>  Split parallel DNS resolution and system DNS resolution into
  separate functions. Previously system DNS resolution was encapsulated
  inside the parallel DNS function, inside a big if block. Now the if
  is on the outside and decides which of the two functions to
  call. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Remove &quot;\r\r&quot; in script output. If you print &quot;\r\n&quot;, the
  Windows C library will transform it to &quot;\r\r\n&quot;. So we just print
  &quot;\n&quot; with no special case for Windows.  Also fixed
  showSMTPversion.nse so that it doesn&#39;t print &quot;\r\r&quot; in the first
  place. [David]
</li><li>  Updated IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)
  generation. [Kris]
</li><li>  OS scan point matching code can now handle tests worth zero
  points. We now assign zero points to ignore a couple tests which
  proved ineffective. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Catch the exceptions that are caused when there&#39;s no XML
  output file, an empty one, or one that&#39;s half-complete. You can
  cause these three situations, respectively, with: &quot;nmap -V&quot;, &quot;nmap
  --iflist&quot;, or &quot;nmap 0&quot;.  Also remove the target requirement for scans
  because you should be able to run commands such as &quot;nmap --iflist&quot;
  from Zenmap. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Guard against the topology graph becoming empty in the
  middle of an animation.  This could happen if you removed a scan
  from the list of scans during an animation. The error looked like:
<pre>
    File &quot;usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/radialnet/gui/RadialNet.py&quot;,
    line 1533, in __livens_up AttributeError: &#39;NoneType&#39; object has no
    attribute &#39;get_nodes&#39;
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash which could occur when you entered a command
  containing only whitespace.  David fixed various other possible
  crashes found in the crash report tracker too.  Zenmap users really
  are capable of finding every possible edge case which could cause a
  crash :).
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.76 [2008-9-12] <a class="versionlink" id="4.76" href="#4.76" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  There is a new &quot;external&quot; script category, for NSE scripts which

</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> A crash was fixed that affected Windows users with

</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s Windows self-installer now correctly registers/deletes the

</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s Windows self-installer now checks whether the MS Visual C++

<li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added a new Scan Topology system. The idea is that if we
  are going to call Nmap the &quot;Network Mapper&quot;, it should at least be
  able to draw you a map of the network!  And that is what this new
  system does. It was achieved by integrating the RadialNet Nmap
  visualization tool (<a href="http://www.dca.ufrn.br">http://www.dca.ufrn.br</a>/~joaomedeiros/radialnet),
  into Zenmap. Joao Medeiros has been developing RadialNet for more
  than a year. For details, complete with some of the most beautiful
  Zenmap screen shots ever, visit
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-topology.html">https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-topology.html</a> . The integration work was
  done by SoC student Vladimir Mitrovic and his mentor David Fifield.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Another exciting new Zenmap feature is Scan Aggregation.
  This allows you to visualize and analyze the results of multiple
  scans at once, as if they were from one Nmap execution. So you might
  scan one network, analyze the results a bit, then scan some of the
  machines more intensely or add a completely new subnet to the
  scan. The new results are seamlessly added to the old, as described
  at <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-scanning.html#aggregation">https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-scanning.html#aggregation</a>. [David,
  Vladimir]
</li><li>  Expanded nmap-services to include information on how frequently each
  port number is found open.  The results were generated by scanning
  tens of millions of IPs on the Internet this summer, and augmented
  with internal network data contributed by some large
  organizations. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Nmap now scans the most common 1,000 ports by default in either
  protocol (UDP scan is still optional).  This is a decrease from
  1,715 TCP ports and 1,488 UDP ports in Nmap 4.68.  So Nmap is faster
  by default and, since the port selection is better thanks to the
  port frequency data, it often finds more open ports as
  well. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Nmap fast scan (-F) now scans the top 100 ports by default in either
  protocol.  This is a decrease from 1,276 (TCP) and 1,017 (UDP) in
  Nmap 4.68. Port scanning time with -F is generally an order of
  magnitude faster than before, making -F worthy of its &quot;fast scan&quot;
  moniker. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  The --top-ports option lets you specify the number of ports you wish
  to scan in each protocol, and will pick the most popular ports for
  you based on the new frequency data.  For both TCP and UDP, the top
  10 ports gets you roughly half of the open ports.  The top 1,000
  (out of 65,536 possible) finds roughly 93% of the open TCP ports and
  more than 95% of the open UDP ports. [Fyodor, Doug Hoyte]
</li><li>  David integrated all of your OS detection fingerprint and correction
  submissions from March 11 until mid-July.  In the process, we
  reached the 1500-signature milestone for the 2nd generation OS
  detection system. We can now detect the newest iPhones, Linux
  2.6.25, OS X Darwin 9.2.2, Windows Vista SP1, and even the Nintendo
  Wii. Nmap now has 1,503 signatures, vs. 1,320 in 4.68. Integration
  is now faster and more pleasant thanks to the new OSassist
  application developed by Nmap SoC student Michael Pattrick. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0089.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0089.html</a> and
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0139.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0139.html</a> for more details.
</li><li>  Nmap now works with Windows 2000 again, after being broken by our
  IPv6 support improvements in version 4.65. A couple new dependencies
  are required to run on Win2K, as described at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html#inst-win2k">https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html#inst-win2k</a> .
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added a context-sensitive help system to the Profile
  Editor.  You can now mouse-over options to learn more about what
  they are used for and their proper argument syntax. [Jurand Nogiec]
</li><li>  When Nmap finds a probe during ping scan which elicits a response,
  it now saves that information for the port scan and later phases.
  It can then &quot;ping&quot; the host with that probe as necessary to collect
  timing information even if the host is not responding to the normal
  port scan packets. Previously, Nmap&#39;s port scan timing pings could
  only use information gathered during that port scan itself.  A
  number of other &quot;port scan ping&quot; system improvements were made at
  the same time to improve performance against firewalled hosts. For
  full details, see <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0647.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0647.html</a>
  [David, Michael, Fyodor]
</li><li>  --traceroute now uses the timing ping probe saved from host
  discovery and port scanning instead of finding its own probe. The
  timing ping probe is always the best probe Nmap knows about for
  eliciting a response from a target. This will have the most effect
  on traceroute after a ping scan, where traceroute would sometimes
  pick an ineffective probe and traceroute would fail even though the
  target was up. [David]
</li><li>  Added dns-safe-recursion-port and dns-safe-recursion-txid
  (non-default NSE scripts) which use the 3rd party dns-oarc.net
  lookup to test the source port and transaction ID randomness of
  discovered DNS servers (assuming they allow recursion at all).
  These scripts, which test for the &quot;Kaminsky&quot; DNS bugs, were
  contributed by Brandon Enright.
</li><li>  Added whois.nse, which queries the Regional Internet Registries
  (RIRs) to determine who the target IP addresses are assigned
  to. [Jah]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Overhauled the default list of scan profiles based on
  nmap-dev discussion.  Users now have a much more diverse and useful
  set of default profile options. And if they don&#39;t like any of those
  canned scan commands, they can easily create their own in the
  Profile Editor! [David]
</li><li>  Fyodor made a number of performance tweaks, such as:
<ul><li>increase host group sizes in many cases, so Nmap will now commonly
    scan 64 hosts at a time rather than 30
</li><li>align host groups with common network boundaries, such as /24 or
    /25
</li><li>Increase maximum per-target port-scan ping frequency to one every
    1.25 seconds rather than every five. Port scan pings happen
    against heavily firewalled hosts and the like when Nmap is not
    receiving enough responses to normal scan to properly calculate
    timing variables and detect packet drops.</li></ul>

</li><li>  Added a new NSE binlib library, which offers bin.pack() and
  bin.unpack() functions for dealing with storing values in and
  extracting them from binary strings.  For details, see
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-library.html#nse-binlib">https://nmap.org/book/nse-library.html#nse-binlib</a> . [Philip
  Pickering]
</li><li>  Added a new NSE DNS library. See this thread:
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0310.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0310.html</a> [Philip Pickering]
</li><li>  Added new NSE libraries for base64 encoding, SNMP, and POP3 mail
  operations.  They are described at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0233.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0233.html</a> . [Philip Pickering]
</li><li>  Added NSE scripts popcapa (retrieves POP3 server capabilities) and
  brutePOP3 (brute force POP3 authentication cracker) which make use
  of the new POP3 library. [Philip Pickering]
</li><li>  Added the SNMPcommunitybrute NSE script, which is a brute force
  community string cracker. Also modified SNMPsysdescr to use the new
  SNMP library. [Philip Pickering]
</li><li>  Fixed the SMTPcommands script so that it can&#39;t return multiple
  values (which was causing problems). Thanks to Jah for tracking down
  the problem and sending a fix for SMTPcommands. Then Patrick fixed
  NSE so it can handle misbehaving scripts like this without causing
  mysterious side effects.
</li><li>  Added a new NSE Unpwdb (username/password database) library for
  easily obtaining usernames or passwords from a list.  The functions
  usernames() and passwords() return a closure which returns a new
  list entry with every call, or nil when the list is exhausted.  You
  can specify your own username and/or password lists via the script
  arguments userdb and passdb, respectively. [Kris]
</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s Nsock-utilizing subsystems (DNS, NSE, version detection) have
  been updated to support the -S and --ip-options flags. [Kris]
</li><li>  A new --max-rate option was added, which complements --min-rate. It
  allows you to specify the maximum byte rate that Nmap is allowed to
  send packets. [David]
</li><li>  Added --ip-options support for the connect() scan (-sT). [Kris]
</li><li>  Nsock now supports binding to a local address and setting IPv4
  options with nsi_set_localaddr() and nsi_set_ipoptions(),
  respectively. [Kris]
</li><li>  Added IPProto Ping (-PO) support to Traceroute, and fixed support for
  IPProto Scan (-sO) and the ICMP Pings (-PE, -PP, -PM) in Traceroute
  as well.  These could cause Nmap to hang during Traceroute. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added a &quot;Cancel&quot; button for cancelling a scan in progress
  without losing any Nmap output obtained so far. [Jurand Nogiec]
</li><li>  Improve the netbios-<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html">smb-os-discovery</a> NSE script to improve target
  port selection and to also decode the system&#39;s timestamp from an SMB
  response. [Ron at SkullSecurity]
</li><li>  Nmap now avoids collapsing large numbers of ports in open|filtered
  state (e.g. just printing that 500 ports are in that state rather
  than listing them individually) if verbosity or debugging levels are
  greater than two.  See this thread:
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0312.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0312.html</a> . [Fyodor]
</li><li>  The NSE <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http</a> library now supports chunked encoding. [Sven Klemm]
</li><li>  The NSE <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/datafiles.html">datafiles</a> library now has generic file parsing routines, and
  the parsing of the standard nmap data files (e.g. nmap-services,
  nmap-protocols, etc.) now uses those generic routines.  NSE scripts
  and libraries may find them useful for dealing with their own data
  files, such as password lists. [Jah]
</li><li>  Passed the big revision 10,000 milestone in the Nmap project SVN
  server: <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0682.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0682.html</a>
</li><li>  Added some Windows and MinGW compatibility patches submitted by
  Gisle Vanem.
</li><li>  Improved nse_init so that compilation/runtime errors in NSE scripts
  no longer cause the script engine to abort. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Fix a cosmetic bug in --script-trace hex dump output which resulting
  in bytes with the highest bit set being prefixed with ffffff. [Sven
  Klemm]
</li><li>  Removed the nselib-bin directory. The last remaining shared NSE
  module, bit, has been made static by Patrick. Shared modules were
  broken for static builds of Nmap, such as those in the RPMS. We also
  had the compilation problems (particularly on OpenBSD) with shared
  modules which lead us to make PCRE static a while back. [David]
</li><li>  Updated <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcinfo.html">rpcinfo</a> NSE script to use the new pack/unpack (binlib)
  functions, use the new <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/tab.html">tab</a> library, include better documentation, and
  fix some bugs. [Sven Klemm]
</li><li>  Add useful details to the error message printed when an NSE script
  fails to load (due to syntax error, etc.) [Patrick]
</li><li>  Fix a bug in the NSE <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http</a> library which would cause some scripts to
  give the error: SCRIPT ENGINE: C:\Program
  Files\Nmap\nselib/http.lua:77: attempt to call field &#39;parse&#39; (a nil
  value) [Jah]
</li><li>  Fixed a couple of Makefile problems (race condition) which could
  lead to build failures when launching make in parallel mode (e.g.
  -j4). [Michal Januszewski, Chris Clements]
</li><li>  Added new addrow() function to NSE <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/tab.html">tab</a> library.  It allows
  developers to add a whole row at once rather than doing a separate
  add() call for each column in a row. [Sven Klemm]
</li><li>  Completion time estimates provided in verbose mode or when you hit a
  key during scanning are now more accurate thanks to algorithm
  improvements by David.
</li><li>  Fixed a number of NSE scripts which used print_debug()
  incorrectly. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0470.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0470.html</a> . [Sven Klemm]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The Ports/Hosts view now provides full version detection
  values rather than just a simple summary. [Jurand Nogiec]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> When you edit the command-entry field, then change the
  target selection, Nmap no longer blows away your edits in favor of
  using your current profile. [Jurand Nogiec]
</li><li>  Nsock now returns data from UDP packets individually, preserving the
  packet boundary, rather than concatenating the data from multiple
  packets into a single buffer.  This fixes a problem related to our
  reverse-DNS system, which can only handle one DNS packet at a time.
  Thanks to Tim Adam of ManageSoft for debugging the problem and
  sending the patch.  Doug Hoyte helped with testing, and it was
  applied by Fyodor.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Fixed a crash which would occur when you try to compare two
  files, either of which has more than one extraports element. [David]
</li><li>  Added the undocumented (except here) --nogcc option which disables
  global/group congestion control algorithms and so each member of a
  scan group of machines is treated separately.  This is just an
  experimental option for now. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The Ports/Hosts display now has different colors for open
  and closed ports. [Vladimir]
</li><li>  Fixed Zenmap so that it displays all Nmap errors.  Previously, only
  stdout was redirected into the window, and not stderr.  Now they are
  both redirected. [Vladimir]
</li><li>  NSE can now be used in combination with ping scan (e.g. &quot;-sP
  --script&quot;) so that you can execute host scripts without needing to
  perform a port scan. [Kris]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Category names are now case insensitive. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Each thread for a script now gets its own action closure (and
  upvalues). See: <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0549.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0549.html</a>
  [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> The script_scan_result structure has been changed to a class,
  ScriptResult, which now holds a Script&#39;s output in an std::string.
  This removes the need to use malloc and free to manage this memory.
  A similar change was made to the run_record structure. [Patrick]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[NSE]</span> Fixed a socket exhaustion deadlock which could prevent a
  script scan from ever finishing. Now, rather than limit the total
  number of sockets which can be open, we limit the number of scripts
  which can have sockets open at once.  And once a script has one
  socket opened, it is permitted to open as many more as it
  needs. [Patrick]
</li><li>  A hashing library (code from OpenSSL) was added to NSE.  hashlib
  contains md5 and sha1 routines. [Philip Pickering]
</li><li>  Fixed host discovery probe matching when looking at the returned TCP
  data in an ICMP error message.  This could formerly lead to
  incorrectly discarded responses and the debugging error message:
  &quot;Bogus trynum or sequence number in ICMP error message&quot; [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a segmentation fault in Nsock which occurred when calling
  nsock_write() with a data length of -1 (which means the data is a
  NUL-terminated string and Nsock should take the length itself) and
  the Nsock trace level was at least 2. [Kris]
</li><li>  The NSE Comm library now defaults to trying to read as many bytes as
  are available rather than lines if neither the &quot;bytes&quot; nor &quot;lines&quot;
  options are given.  Thanks to Brandon for reporting a problem which
  he noticed in the dns-test-open-recursion script. [Kris]
</li><li>  Updated zoneTrans.nse to replace length bytes in returned domain
  names to periods itself rather than relying on NSE&#39;s old behavior of
  replacing non-printable characters with periods.  Thanks to Rob
  Nicholls for reporting the problem. [Kris]
</li><li>  Some Zenmap crashes have been fixed: trying to &quot;refresh&quot; the output
  of a scan loaded from a file, and trying to re-save a file loaded
  from the command line in some circumstances. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The file selector now remembers what directory it was last
  looking at. [David]
</li><li>  Added an extra layer of validity checking to received packets
  (readip_pcap), just to be extra safe. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0644.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0644.html</a> . [Kris]
</li><li>  Zenmap defaults to showing files matching both *.xml and *.usr in
  the file selector. Previously it only showed those matching *.usr.
  The new combined format will be XML and .usr will be deprecated.
  See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0093.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0093.html</a> .
</li><li>  Nmap avoids printing the sending rate in bytes per second during a
  TCP connect scan. Because the number of bytes per probe is not
  known, it used to print current sending rates: 11248.85 packets / s,
  0.00 bytes / s.  Now it will print simply print rates like &quot;11248.85
  packets / s&quot;. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Nmap&#39;s installation process now include .desktop files
  which install menu items for launching Zenmap as a privileged or
  non-privileged process on Linux. This will mainly affect people who
  install nmap and Zenmap directly from the source code. [Michael]
</li><li>  Improved performance of IP protocol scan by fixing a bug related to
  timing calculations on ICMP probe responses.  See r8754 svn log for
  full details. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap --reason output no longer falsely reports a localhost-response
  during -PN scans. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0188.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0188.html</a> . [Michael]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The higwidgets Python package has moved so it is now a
  subpackage of zenmapGUI. This avoids naming conflicts with Umit,
  which uses a slightly different version of higwidgets. [David]
</li><li>  A bug that could cause some host discovery probes to be incorrectly
  interpreted as drops was fixed. This occurred only when the IP
  protocol ping (-PO) option was combined with other ping
  types. [David]
</li><li>  A new scanflags attribute has been added to XML output, which lists
  all user specified --scanflags for the scan. nmap.dtd has been
  modified to account for this. [Michael]
</li><li>  The loading of the nmap-services file has been made much
  faster--roughly 9 times faster in common cases.  This is important
  for the new (much larger) frequency augmented nmap-services
  file. [David]
</li><li>  Added a script (ASN.nse) which uses Team Cymru&#39;s DNS interface to
  determine the routing AS numbers of scanned IP addresses.  They even
  set up a special domain just for Nmap queries.  The script is still
  experimental and non-default. [Jah, Michael]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Clicking &quot;Cancel&quot; in a file chooser in the diff interface
  no longer causes a crash. [David]
</li><li>  The shtool build helper script has been updated to version 2.0.8. An
  older version of shutil caused installation to fail when the locale
  was set to et_EE. Thanks to Michal Januszewski for the bug
  report. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Removed services.dmp and os_dmp.dmp and all the files that
  referred to them. They are not needed with the new search
  interface. Also removed an unused search progress bar.  And some
  broken fingerprint submission code.  Yay for de-bloating! [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Added &quot;%F&quot; to the Exec link in the new Zenmap desktop
  file. We expect (hope) that this will allow dragging and dropping
  XML files onto the icon. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The -o[XGASN] options can now be specified, just as you can
  at the console. [Vladimir]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> You can now shrink the scan window below its default
  size thanks to NmapOutputViewer code enhancements. [David]
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> Removed optional use of the Psyco Python optimizer since
  Zenmap is not the kind of CPU-bound application which benefits from
  Psyco.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> You can now select more than one host in the &quot;Ports /
  Hosts&quot; view by control-clicking them in the column at left.
</li><li>  <span class="cltag">[Zenmap]</span> The profile editor now offers the --traceroute option.
</li><li>  Zenmap now uses Unicode objects pervasively when dealing with Nmap
  text output, though the only internationalized text Nmap currently
  outputs is the user&#39;s time zone. [David]
</li><li>  Unprintable characters in NSE script output (which really shouldn&#39;t
  happen anyway) are now printed like \xHH, where HH is the
  hexadecimal representation of the character. See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0180.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0180.html</a> . [Patrick]
</li><li>  Nmap sometimes sent packets with incorrect IP checksums,
  particularly when sending the UDP probes in OS detection. This has
  been fixed. Thanks to Gisle Vanem for reporting and investigating the
  bug. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed the --without-liblua configure option so that it works
  again. [David]
</li><li>  In the interest of forward compatibility, the xmloutputversion
  attribute in Nmap XML output is no longer constrained to be a
  certain string (&quot;1.02&quot;). The xmloutputversion should be taken as
  merely advisory by authors of parsers.
</li><li>  Zenmap no longer leaves any temporary files lying around. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap only prints an uptime guess in verbose mode now, because in
  some situations it can be very inaccurate. See the discussion at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0392.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0392.html</a> . [David]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.68 [2008-6-28] <a class="versionlink" id="4.68" href="#4.68" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Doug integrated all of your version detection submissions and
  corrections for the year up to May 31.  There were more than 1,000
  new submissions and 18 corrections.  Please keep them coming!  And
  don&#39;t forget that corrections are very important, so do submit them
  if you ever catch Nmap making a version detection or OS detection
  mistake.  The version detection DB has grown to 5,054 signatures
  representing 486 service protocols.  Protocols span the gamut from
  abc, acap, access-remote-pc, activefax, and activemq, to zebedee,
  zebra, zenimaging, and zenworks.  The most popular protocols are
  http (1,672 signatures), telnet (519), ftp (459), smtp (344), and
  pop3 (201).
</li><li>  Nmap compilation on Windows is now done with Visual C++ Express 2008
  rather than 2005.  Windows compilation instructions have been
  updated at <a href="https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html#inst-win-source">https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html#inst-win-source</a> .
  [Kris]
</li><li>  The Nmap Windows self-installer now automatically installs the MS
  Visual C++ 2008 runtime components if they aren&#39;t already installed
  on a system.  These are some reasonably small DLLs that are
  generally necessary for applications compiled with Visual C++ (with
  dynamic linking).  Many or most systems already have these installed
  from other software packages.  The lack of these components led to
  the error message &quot;The Application failed to initialize properly
  (0xc0150002).&quot; with Nmap 4.65.  A related change is that Nmap on
  Windows is now compiled with /MD rather than /MT so that it
  consistently uses these runtime libraries.  The patch was created by
  Rob Nicholls.
</li><li>  Added advanced search functionality to Zenmap so that you can locate
  previous scans using criteria such as which ports were open, keywords
  in the target names, OS detection results, etc.  Try it out with
  Ctrl-F or &quot;Tools-&gt;Search Scan Results&quot;. [Vladimir]
</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s special WinPcap installer now handles 64-bit Windows machines
  by installing the proper 64-bit npf.sys. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  Added a new NSE Comm (common communication) library for common
  network discovery tasks such as banner-grabbing (get_banner()) and
  making a quick exchange of data (exchange()).  16 scripts were
  updated to use this library. [Kris]
</li><li>  The Nmap Scripting Engine now supports mutexes for gracefully
  handling concurrency issues.  Mutexes are documented at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html#nse-mutex">https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html#nse-mutex</a> . [Patrick]
</li><li>  Added a UDP SNMPv3 probe to version detection, along with 9 vendor
  match lines. The patch was from Tom Sellers, who contributed other
  probes and match lines to this release as well.
</li><li>  Added a new timing_level() function to NSE which reports the Nmap
  timing level from 0 to 5, as set by the Nmap -T option.  The default
  is 3. [Thomas Buchanan]
</li><li>  Update the HTTP library to use the new timing_level functionality to
  set connection and response timeouts. An error preventing the new
  timing_level feature from working was also fixed.  [Jah]
</li><li>  Optimized the doAnyOutstandingProbes() function to make Nmap a bit
  faster and more efficient.  This makes a particularly big difference
  in cases where --min-rate is being used to specify a very high
  packet sending rate. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed an integer overflow which prevented a target specification of
  &quot;*.*.*.*&quot; from working.  Support for the CIDR /0 is now also
  available for those times you wish to scan the entire
  Internet. [Kris]
</li><li>  The robots.nse script has been improved to print output more
  compactly and limit the number of entries of large robots.txt files
  based on Nmap verbosity and debugging levels. [Eddie Bell]
</li><li>  The Nmap NSE scripts have been re-categorized in a more logical
  fashion.  The new categories are described at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-categories">https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-categories</a> . [Kris]
</li><li>  Improve AIX support by linking against -lodm and -lcfg on that
  platform. [David]
</li><li>  Updated showHTMLTitle NSE script to follow one HTTP redirect if
  necessary as long as it is on the same server. [Jah]
</li><li>  Michael Pattrick and David created a new OSassist application which
  streamlines the OS fingerprint submission integration process and
  prevents certain previously common errors.  OSassist isn&#39;t part of
  Nmap, but the system was used to integrate some submissions for this
  release.  13 fingerprints were added during OSassist testing, and
  some existing fingerprints were improved as well.  Expect many more
  fingerprints coming soon.
</li><li>  Improved the mapping from dnet device names (like eth0) and WinPcap
  names (like \Device\NPF_{28700713...}).  You can see this mapping
  with --iflist, and the change should make Nmap more likely to work
  on Windows machines with unusual networking configurations. [David]
</li><li>  Service fingerprints in XML output are no longer be truncated to
  2kb.  [Michael]
</li><li>  Some laptops report the IP Family as NULL for disabled WiFi cards.
  This could lead to a crash with the &quot;sin-&gt;sin_family == AF_INET6&quot;
  assertion failure.  Nmap no longer quits when this is
  encountered. [Michael]
</li><li>  On systems without the GNU getopt_long_only() function, Nmap has its
  own replacement.  That replacement used to call the system&#39;s
  getopt() function if it exists.  But the AIX and Solaris getopt()
  functions proved insufficient/buggy, so Nmap now always calls its
  own internal getopt() now from its getopt_long_only()
  replacement. [David]
</li><li>  Integrated several service match lines from Tom Sellers.
</li><li>  An error was fixed where Zenmap would crash when trying to load from
  the recent scans database a file containing non-ASCII
  characters. The error looked like
<pre>
    pysqlite2.dbapi2.OperationalError: Could not decode to UTF-8 column
      &#39;nmap_xml_output&#39; with text
    &#39;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
    &lt;nmaprun profile=&quot;nmap -T Aggressive -n -v %s&quot; scanner=&quot;nmap&quot; hint=&quot;&quot;
</pre>  The error would be seen when such a scan was found in using the
  search interface. [David]
</li><li>  Fix a Zenmap crash which occurred when local.getpreferredencoding()
  returns &quot;None&quot;.  Similarly, deal with the case when a &quot;X-MAC-KOREAN&quot;
  is returned by this function.  Both problems were found with the
  Zenmap crash reporter. [David]
</li><li>  A whole bunch of internal Zenmap cleanup was done by David to make
  the code more logical and remove dead code.
</li><li>  Install icons and pixmaps under /usr/share/zenmap/{icons,pixmaps} so
  they don&#39;t get mixed in with the files in
  /usr/share/{icons,pixmaps}.  [Jurand Nogiec]
</li><li>  Fixed a Zenmap command entry problem where Zenmap would lose a
  custom command you had entered into the command entry field if you
  changed the target field after entering the custom command. [Jurand
  Nogiec]
</li><li>  The Zenmap crash reporter now includes a stack trace rather than
  just the exception name. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap now executes the proper Nmap command by honoring the
  nmap_command_path variable in zenmap.conf. [Jurand Nogiec]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which caused -PN to erroneously bail out for
  unprivileged users.  Thanks to Jabra (jabra(a)spl0it.org) for the
  report. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed several Nmap NSE memory leaks found with Valgrind. [Kris]
</li><li>  Migrated some stray malloc()/realloc() calls to the Nbase
  safe_malloc()/safe_realloc() versions which guard against certain
  errors.
</li><li>  Fixed a bunch of subtle bugs, some of which could have resulted in
  a crash, reported by Ilja van Sprundel. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed several byte-order bugs in Traceroute. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a crash in RateMeter::update() which could lead to an error
  saying &quot;diff &gt;= 0.0&quot; assertion failed.  I think the problem was
  actually caused by SMP machines which didn&#39;t sync the clock time
  perfectly.  This lead to gettimeofday() sometimes reporting that
  time decreased by some microseconds.  Now Nmap is willing to
  tolerate decreases of up to 1 millisecond in this function. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Nmap now returns correct values for --iflist in windows even
  if interface aliases have been set. Previously it would misreport
  the windevices and not list all interfaces. [Michael]
</li><li>  Nmap no longer crashes with an &#39;assert&#39; error when its told to
  access a disabled WiFi NIC on some laptops. [Michael]
</li><li>  Upgraded the OpenSSL shipped for Windows to 0.9.8h. [Kris]
</li><li>  The NSE <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/http.html">http</a> library was updated to gracefully handle certain bogus
  (non-)http responses. [Jah]
</li><li>  The zoneTrans.nse script now takes a &quot;domain&quot; script argument to
  specify the desired domain name to transfer.  You can narrow the
  scope down with the form &quot;zoneTrans={domain=xxx}&quot;. [Kris]
</li><li>  Increase write buffer length for Nmap output on Windows. This should
  prevent error messages like: &quot;log_vwrite: vsnprintf failed.  Even
  after increasing bufferlen to 819200, Vsnprintf returned -1 (logt ==
  1).&quot;  Thanks to prozente0 for the report. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Fixed the --script-updatedb command, which was claiming to be
  &quot;Aborting database update&quot; even when the update was performed
  perfectly.  See <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0623.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0623.html</a> .
  Thanks to Jah for the report.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.65 [2008-6-1] <a class="versionlink" id="4.65" href="#4.65" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  A Mac OS X Nmap/Zenmap installer is now available from the Nmap
  download page!  It is rather straightforward, but detailed
  instructions are available anyway at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/inst-macosx.html">https://nmap.org/book/inst-macosx.html</a> .  As a universal installer,
  it works on both Intel and PPC Macs. It is distributed as a disk
  image file (.dmg) containing an mpkg package.  The installed Nmap
  does include OpenSSL support.  It also supports Authorization
  Services so that Zenmap can run as root.  David created this
  installer.  He wants to thank Benson Kalahar and Vlad Alexa for
  extensive testing of the nine test releases.
</li><li>  The Windows version of Nmap now supports OpenSSL just as the UNIX
  versions have for years.  Both the .zip and executable installer
  binary packages we ship from the Nmap download page now include
  OpenSSL. [Kris, Thomas Buchanan]
</li><li>  We now compile in IPv6 support on Windows.  In order to use this,
  you need to have IPv6 set up.  It is installed by default on Vista,
  but must be downloaded from Microsoft for XP.  See
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/network/ipv6/ipv6faq.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/network/ipv6/ipv6faq.mspx</a> . [Kris]
</li><li>  Seven Google-sponsored Summer of Code students began working on
  exciting Nmap projects full times.  The winning students and their
  Nmap development projects are described at
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0132.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0132.html</a> .
</li><li>  Our WinPcap installer now starts the NPF driver running as a
  service immediately upon installation and after restarts. You can
  disable this with new check-boxes. This behavior is important for
  Vista and Windows Server 2008 machines when User Account
  Control (UAC) is enabled. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  Nmap and Nmap-WinPcap silent installation now works.  Nmap can
  be silently installed with the /S option to the installer.
  If you install Nmap from the zip file, you can install just
  WinPcap silently with the /S option to that
  installer. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  Our WinPcap installer is now included with the Nmap Win32 zip
  file. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Numerous miscellaneous improvements were made to our Win32
  installer, such as using the &quot;Modern&quot; NSIS UI for WinPcap,
  improving the option description labels, and showing a finish
  page in all cases. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  The nmap-dev and nmap-hackers mailing list RSS feeds at seclists.org
  now include message excerpts to make it easier to identify
  interesting messages and speed the process of reading through the
  list.  Feeds for all other mailing lists archived at SecLists.Org
  have been similarly augmented.  For details, see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0333.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0333.html</a> . [David]
</li><li>  A new &quot;default&quot; Nmap Scripting Engine category was added.  Only
  scripts in this category now run by default (except for &quot;version&quot;
  scripts which run when version detection was requested).
  Previously, any scripts in the &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;intrusive&quot; categories were
  run.  21 scripts are now in this default category. [Kris]
</li><li>  The NSE HTTP library now uses the host name specified on the command
  line when making requests, which improves script scanning against
  web servers with virtual hosts. Thanks to Sven Klemm for the patch.
</li><li>  Added some new and improved version detection signatures. [Brandon]
</li><li>  Fixed an OS detection bug that prevented the R1.UID test result from
  being recorded properly when scanning certain printers from
  little-endian computers. Updated nmap-os-db to compensate for
  signatures that had an incorrect U1.RID value.  [Michael]
</li><li>  Updated to include the latest MAC Address prefixes from the IEEE in
  nmap-mac-prefixes [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Updated the SMTPcommands NSE script to work better against Postfix
  and reduce verbosity. [Jasey DePriest, Fyodor]
</li><li>  Reorganized the way ping probes are handled internally.  Rather than
  being stored in the NmapOps structure, they are now stored within
  the individual scan_lists structures.  This is a cleaner
  organization. [Michael]
</li><li>  Fix grepable output&#39;s &quot;Ignored State&quot; reporting.  Only one ignored
  state (the one with the highest numbers of ports) is shown. [David]
</li><li>  Update to Lua version 5.1.3 [Patrick]
</li><li>  Add NSE <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/stdnse.html">stdnse</a> library to include tobinary, tooctal, and tohex
  functions. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which caused the Zenmap crash reporter to, uh,
  crash. [David]
</li><li>  NSE engine was cleaned up significantly.  nse_auxiliar was removed,
  and file system manipulation functions were moved from nse_init.cc
  into a new nse_fs.cc file.  Numerous interfaces between Nmap and Lua
  were improved.  Most of these functions are now callable directly by
  Lua. [Patrick]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in the showOwner NSE script which caused it to try UDP
  ports instead of just TCP ports.  This made it very slow in the
  common case where there are many UDP ports in the open|filtered
  state.  Thanks to Jasey DePriest for reporting the problem and Jah
  for tracking it down and fixing it.
</li><li>  Nbase now generates pseudo-random numbers itself rather than using
  /dev/urandom on Linux and the terrible rand() function on Windows.
  The new system uses ARC4 based on libdnet&#39;s
  implementation. [Brandon]
</li><li>  Made a number of updates and improvements to the Zenmap Users&#39; Guide
  at <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html">https://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html</a> . [David]
</li><li>  Fixed the way Zenmap handles command-line entry to prevent your
  custom command-line to be overwritten with the current profile&#39;s
  command just because you edited the target field. [Jurand]
</li><li>  Nsock was improved to better support reading from non-network
  descriptors such as stdin.  This is important for the upcoming Ncat
  project Mixter is working on. [Mixter]
</li><li>  A bug was fixed that could cause Zenmap to crash when loading a
  results file that had multibyte characters in it. The error looked
  like:
  Gtk-ERROR **: file gtktextsegment.c: line 196
  (_gtk_char_segment_new): assertion failed:
  (gtk_text_byte_begins_utf8_char (text))
  [David]
</li><li>  Removed a superfluous test for the existence of the C++ compiler in
  the configure script. The test was not robust when configured with
  CXX=&quot;ccache g++&quot;. Thanks to Rainer M&uuml;ller for the report.
</li><li>  Optimized cached DNS lookups so they are equally efficient when
  running on big-endian or little-endian systems. [Michael]
</li><li>  Fixed the nmap_command_path Zenmap configuration variable so that it
  is actually used to start the specified Nmap executable
  path. [Jurand Nogiec]
</li><li>  Nmap now reports scan start and end times for individual hosts
  within a larger scan. The information is added to the XML host
  element like so: &lt;host starttime=&quot;1198292349&quot; endtime=&quot;1198292370&quot;&gt;
  It is also printed in normal output if -d or &quot;-v -v&quot; are
  specified. [Brandon, Kris, Fyodor]
</li><li>  &quot;make uninstall&quot; now uninstalls Zenmap as well as Nmap. The
  uninstall_zenmap script now deletes directories that were
  installed. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which caused Nmap to send bad checksums on Solaris 10
  x86.  This was due to a workaround for an Ancient Solaris 2.1 bug
  which activated when the OS string matched &quot;solaris2.1*&quot;.  The
  problem has now been resolved until Solaris 20 comes out and hits
  our &quot;solaris2.2*&quot; bug workarounds. Thanks to Nathan Bills for the
  problem report.  Fixed by Fyodor.
</li><li>  Fixed a minor memory leak in getpts_simple which occurs when no
  ports are to be added to &#39;list&#39;. &#39;porttbl&#39; is now free&#39;d regardless
  of how the function returns. [Michael]
</li><li>  Nmap now understands the RFC 4007 percent syntax for IPv6 Zone IDs.
  On Windows, this ID has to be a numeric index.  On Linux and some
  other OS&#39;s, this ID can instead be an interface name.  Some examples
  of this syntax:
<pre>
    fe80::20f:b0ff:fec6:15af%2
    fe80::20f:b0ff:fec6:15af%eth0
</pre>  [Kris]
</li><li>  The Zenmap installer and uninstaller are more careful about escaping
  filenames and dealing with an installation root (DESTDIR). [David]
</li><li>  Since assert() calls are used for various security-related tests,
  their safety is now ensured by keeping NDEBUG undefined throughout
  Nmap, Nbase and Nsock. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fix a couple bugs in the way the Nmap build system checked for an
  existing LUA library.  A bashism caused one test to fail on system
  which don&#39;t use bash as /bin/sh, and another bug fixed --with-liblua
  configure option for specifying your own liblua. [Daniel
  Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  The NSE nmap.registry.args table is now available, albeit empty,
  when --script-args isn&#39;t used.  Now scripts don&#39;t need to check if
  it&#39;s nil before attempting to index it. [Kris]
</li><li>  Changed SSLv2-support.nse so that it only enumerates the list of
  available ciphers with a verbosity level of at least two or with
  debugging enabled. [Kris]
</li><li>  Replaced kibuvDetection.nse with version detection match lines which
  work better than the script. [Kris, Brandon]
</li><li>  Removed mswindowsShell.nse as there is a version detection NULL
  probe match which does the same thing. [Brandon, Fyodor, Kris]
</li><li>  Updated IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)
  generation. [Kris]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.62 [2008-5-3] <a class="versionlink" id="4.62" href="#4.62" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Added a new --min-rate option that allows specifying a minimum rate
  at which to send packets. This allows you to override Nmap&#39;s
  congestion control algorithms and request that Nmap try to keep at
  least the rate you specify.  The rate is given in packets per
  second. Read more in the Nmap man page
  (<a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html">https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html</a>) [David]
</li><li>  Create /nmap/macosx directory in SVN with files necessary to build
  binary Mac OS X Nmap/Zenmap packages.  We are trying to create
  binary installer packages which are as useful and easy to use as the
  Windows installer.  This has involved a lot of work by David.  We
  aren&#39;t quite yet distributing the results on the Nmap download page,
  but testing our beta versions is useful.  You can find the latest
  universal (PPC and Intel) binary test version by looking at David
  Fifield&#39;s posts at <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/author.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/author.html</a> .
  You can also read /nmap/macosx/README in svn for more info.
</li><li>  Nmap 2008 Summer of Code students have began working (though full
  time doesn&#39;t start until late May).  Learn about the winners and
  their projects at <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0132.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q2/0132.html</a> .
</li><li>  Brandon added/modified a whole bunch of version detection signatures
  based on systems discovered when scanning UCSD&#39;s network.
</li><li>  Reformat Nmap COPYING file (e.g. remove C comment markers, reduce
  line length) during Nmap windows build so that it looks much better
  when presented by the Windows executable (NSIS) installer.  Thanks
  to Jah for the patch, which was modified slightly by Fyodor.
</li><li>  Added NSE Datafiles library which reads and parses Nmap&#39;s nmap-*
  data files for scripts.  The functions (parse_protocols(),
  parse_rpc() and parse_services()) return tables with numbers
  (e.g. port numbers) indexing names (e.g. service names).  The
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcinfo.html">rpcinfo</a>.nse script was also updated to use this library. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in the nbase random number generator (and the way it
  interacted with Nmap and MS Windows) which caused <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/duplicates.html">duplicates</a> in some
  instances.  Thanks to Jah for reporting the problem and working with
  Brandon Enright, Fyodor and Kris to fix it.
</li><li>  It turns out that hours contain 60 minutes, not 24.  Fixed a scan
  status message which was rolling over the hours column
  prematurely. [David]
</li><li>  Added scripting options to Zenmap profile editor and command wizard
  to make use of NSE. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap now prints an exception message rather than segfaulting when
  it can&#39;t open a display (such as when trying to connect to an X
  server as an unauthorized user). Thanks to Aaron Leininger for the
  initial report and Guilherme Polo for suggesting the fix.
</li><li>  Now ports in the &quot;unfiltered&quot; state can be selected for attention by
  NSE scripts. [Kris]
</li><li>  Nbase random number generation system now avoids having a high-bit
  of zero in every other byte on Windows due to Windows having such a
  low RAND_MAX. [Jah]
</li><li>  Added release dates for each Nmap version to this CHANGELOG going
  back to Nmap 3.00 (July 31, 2002).  Dates are in MM/DD/YY format.
  If someone wants to track down dates for the last 22% of the file
  (pre-3.00), you are welcome to do so and send a patch.  Searching
  Google for the version number and site:seclists.org seems to work
  well. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Nmap RPM builds now use the versions of libdnet, libpcap, libpcre,
  and liblua included with Nmap rather than whatever happens to be
  installed on the build system. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap can now be installed in and run in directories with a space
  in the name. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed an assertion failure (&quot;Target.cc:396: void
  Target::stopTimeOutClock(const timeval*): Assertion
  &#39;htn.toclock_running == true&#39; failed.&quot;) caused when a host had NSE
  scripts in multiple runlevels.  This also fixes --host-timeout
  behavior in NSE. [Kris]
</li><li>  Reduce the maximum number of socket descriptors which Nmap is
  allowed to open concurrently.  This resoles a bug which could cause
  &quot;Too many open files&quot; error on Mac OS X when not running as
  root. [David]
</li><li>  Canonicalized service names between nmap-service-probes (version
  detection DB) and nmap-services (port scanning DB). [Kris]
</li><li>  Removed the &quot;class&quot; attribute from the tcpsequence element in XML
  output. For a long time it had always been &quot;unknown class&quot; because
  Nmap doesn&#39;t calculate a class anymore. The XML output version has
  been increased from 1.01 to 1.02. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug on Win32 which caused an infinite loop when Nmap
  encountered certain broadcast addresses. [Dudi Itzhakov]
</li><li>  Fix MingW compilation by adding a signal.h include to
  main.cc. [Gisle Vanem]
</li><li>  Fix the test in our build system to determine if liblua is already
  available or not. For example, the test needed to link with -lm
  since some systems require that. [David]
</li><li>  Added TIMEVAL_BEFORE and TIMEVAL_AFTER macros to test whether one
  timeval is earlier than another while avoiding possible integer
  overflows in a naive approach we were using previously. [David]
</li><li>  Adjusted a bunch of code to avoid compilation warning messages on
  some Linux machines. [Andrew J. Bennieston]
</li><li>  Fixed the NmapArpCache so that it actually works. Previously, Nmap
  was always falling back to the system ARP cache. Of course this
  raises the question of whether NmapArpCache is needed in the first
  place. [Daniel Roethlisberger]
</li><li>  Fix a Zenmap bug which could cause the error message
  &quot;zenmapCore.NmapOptions.OptionNotFound: No option named &#39;&#39; found!&quot;
  if you create a new profile without checking any options then try to
  edit it. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap now shows a more helpful error message when there is an error
  in executing Nmap. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap now creates the directory ~/.zenmap-etc to store
  automatically generated GTK+ and Pango files. They used to go in the
  application bundle but that doesn&#39;t work on a read-only file system
  or disk image. This is what Wireshark does (~/.wireshark-etc),
  although the directory could be called anything. It doesn&#39;t have to
  persist across sessions.
</li><li>  Added a mechanism in Zenmap for including extra executable search
  paths on specific platforms, so we can include /usr/local/bin in
  PATH on Mac OS X by default and add the Nmap install directory on
  Windows. [David]
</li><li>  We now use --no-strip when building Zenmap Mac OS X packages to
  prevent many mysterious warnings which occur when the binary is
  stripped. [David]
</li><li>  When Zenmap invokes Nmap, it now copies the whole environment for
  the Nmap invocation rather than just providing $PATH.  Windows may
  need this to do proper name resolution. [David]
</li><li>  Corrected uptime parsing and reporting in SNMPsysdesr.nse for an
  uptime of less than 46 hours. [Kris]
</li><li>  Modified the use of CXXFLAGS, CFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS in Nmap build
  system to work better when building Mac OS X universal
  binaries. [David]
</li><li>  Added many additional PCRE option flags to the list returned by the
  NSE pcre.flags() function. [Kris]
</li><li>  Changed the NSE function nmap.set_port_state() so that it checks to
  see if the requested port is already in the requested state.  This
  prevents &quot;Duplicate port&quot; messages during the script scan and the
  inaccurate &quot;script-set&quot; state reason. [Kris]
</li><li>  Canonicalize NSE script license text--more than half did not even
  spell license correctly. They all still say that they are under
  Nmap&#39;s license, just with consistent capitalization and spelling,
  and now a link to Nmap legal page at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-legal.html">https://nmap.org/book/man-legal.html</a> .
</li><li>  Updated ripeQuery.nse to not print extraneous whitespace. [Kris]
</li><li>  Switched telnet brute force password cracking NSE (bruteTelnet.nse)
  to vulnerability category so it isn&#39;t executed by default.  It can
  take too long to run. [Eddie]
</li><li>  NSE status messages now print host name and IP, rather than just the
  host name (which was blank when Nmap didn&#39;t know it). [Jah]
</li><li>  Allocate 128 characters for the idle scan ScanProgressMeter
  title. Previously it was 32 characters. The &quot;idle scan against &quot; and
  the \0 terminator take up 19 characters, leaving only 13, which
  isn&#39;t enough to represent all IP addresses, let alone host
  names. Bug reported by Stephan Fijneman, fixed by David.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.60 [2008-3-15] <a class="versionlink" id="4.60" href="#4.60" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Nmap has moved.  Everything at <a href="http://insecure.org/nmap">http://insecure.org/nmap</a>/ can now be
  found at <a href="https://nmap.org">https://nmap.org</a> .  That should save your fingers from a
  little bit of typing.  Even though transparent redirectors are in
  place for the old URLs, please update your links and bookmarks. And
  if you don&#39;t have a link to Nmap on your web site, now is a good
  time to add one :).
</li><li>  All of your OS detection fingerprints up until March 10, 2008 have
  now been integrated by David.  The second generation database has
  grown from 1,085 fingerprints representing 421 operating
  systems/devices, to 1,304 fingerprints representing 478 systems.
  That is an increase of more than 20%.  New fingerprints were added
  for Mac OS X Tiger, iPod Touch, the La Fonera WAP, FreeBSD 7.0,
  Linux 2.6.24, Windows 2008, Vista, OpenBSD 4.2, and of course
  hundreds of broadband routers, VoIP phones, printers, some crazy
  oscilloscope, etc.  We get a ton of new fingerprint submissions, but
  not as many corrections.  Please remember to visit
  <a href="https://nmap.org/submit">https://nmap.org/submit</a>/ if Nmap gives you bad results, whether they
  are completely wrong or just a slight mistake (like Nmap says Linux
  2.6.20-2.6.23, but you&#39;re running 2.6.24).  Of course you need to be
  certain you know exactly what is running on the target before you do
  this.
</li><li>  All of your service fingerprints and corrections submitted until
  January 14, 2008 have now been integrated by Doug.  As usual, he has
  documented his adventures at <a href="http://hcsw.org/blog.pl/33">http://hcsw.org/blog.pl/33</a> .  More than
  a hundred signatures were added, growing the database to 4,645
  signatures for 457 services.  Corrections are welcome for service
  detection too -- visit <a href="https://nmap.org/submit">https://nmap.org/submit</a>/ if you get incorrect results.
</li><li>  Nmap now saves the target name (if any) specified on the command
  line, since this can differ from the reverse DNS results.  It can be
  particularly important when doing HTTP tests against virtual hosts.
  The data can be accessed from target-&gt;TargetName() from Nmap proper
  and host.targetname from NSE scripts.  The NSE HTTP library now uses
  this for the Host header.  Thanks to Sven Klemm for adding this
  useful feature.
</li><li>  Added NSE HTTP library which allows scripts to easily fetch URLs
  with http.get_url() or create more complex requests with
  http.request().  There is also an http.get() function which takes
  components (hostname, port, and path) rather than a URL.  The
  HTTPAuth, robots, and showHTMLTitle NSE scripts have been updated to
  use this library. Sven Klemm wrote all of this code.
</li><li>  Fixed an integer overflow in the DNS caching code that caused nmap
  to loop infinitely once it had expunging the cache of older
  entries.  Thanks to David Moore for the report, and Eddie Bell for
  the fix.
</li><li>  Fixed another integer overflow in the DNS caching code which caused
  infinite loops. [David]
</li><li>  Added IPv6 host support to the RPC scan.  Attempting this before
  (via -sV) caused a segmentation fault.  Thanks to Will Cladek for
  the report. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed an event handling bug in NSE that could cause execution of
  some in-progress scripts to be excessively delayed. [Marek]
</li><li>  A new NSE table library (<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/tab.html">tab.lua</a>) allows scripts to deliver better
  formatted output.  The Zone transfer script (zoneTrans.nse) has been
  updated to use this new facility. [Eddie]
</li><li>  Rewrote HTTPpasswd.nse to use Sven&#39;s excellent HTTP library and to
  do some much-needed cleaning up. [Kris]
</li><li>  Added a new MsSQL version detection probe and a bunch of match lines
  developed by Tom Sellers.
</li><li>  Added a new service detection probe and signatures for the memcached
  service [Doug]
</li><li>  Added new service detection probes and signatures for the Beast
  Trojan and Firebird RDBMS. [Brandon Enright]
</li><li>  Fixed a crash in Zenmap which occurred when attempting to edit or
  create a new profile based on an existing one when there wasn&#39;t one
  selected.  The error message was:
<pre>
    &#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;toolbar&#39;
</pre>  Now a new Profile Editor is opened.  Thanks to D1N (d1n@inbox.com)
  for the report. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed another crash in Zenmap which occurred when exiting the
  Profile Editor (while editing an existing profile) by clicking the
  &quot;X&quot;, then going to edit the same profile again.  The error message
  was: &quot;No option named &#39;&#39; found!&quot;.  Now the same window that appears
  when clicking Cancel comes up when clicking &quot;X&quot;.  Thanks to David
  for reporting this bug. [Kris]
</li><li>  Another Zenmap bug was fixed: ports consolidated into &quot;extra ports&quot;
  groups are now counted and shown in the &quot;Host Details&quot; tab.  The
  closed, filtered and scanned port counts in this tab didn&#39;t contain
  this information before so they were usually very inaccurate. [Kris]
</li><li>  Another Zenmap bug was fixed: the --scan-delay and --max-scan-delay
  buttons (&quot;amount of time between probes&quot;) under the Advanced tab in
  the Profile Editor were backwards. [Kris]
</li><li>  Added the UDP Scan (-sU) and IPProto Ping (-PO) to Zenmap&#39;s Profile
  Editor and Command Wizard. [Kris]
</li><li>  Reordered the UDP port selection for Traceroute: a closed port is
  now chosen before an open one.  This is because an open UDP port is
  usually due to running version detection (-sV), so a Traceroute
  probe wouldn&#39;t elicit a response. [Kris]
</li><li>  Add Famtech Radmin remote control software probe and signatures to
  the Nmap version detection DB. [Tom Sellers, Fyodor]
</li><li>  Add &quot;Connection: Close&quot; header to requests from HTTP NSE scripts so
  that they finish faster. [Sven Klemm]
</li><li>  Update SSLv2-support NSE script to run against more services which
  are likely SSL. [Sven Klemm]
</li><li>  A bunch of service name canonicalization was done in the Nmap
  version detection file by Brandon Enright (e.g. capitalizing D-Link
  and Netgear consistently).
</li><li>  Upgraded the shipped LibPCRE from version 7.4 to 7.6. [Kris]
</li><li>  Updated to latest (as of 3/15) autoconf config.sub/config.guess
  files from <a href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/config/?root">http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/config/?root</a>=config.
  [Fyodor]
</li><li>  We now escape newlines, carriage returns, and tabs (\n\r\t) in XML
  output.  While those are allowed in XML attributes, they get
  normalized which can make formatting the output difficult for
  applications which parse Nmap XML. [Joao Medeiros, David, Fyodor]
</li><li>  The Zenmap man page is now installed on Unix when &quot;make install&quot; is
  run.  This was supposed to work before, but didn&#39;t. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a man page bug related to our DocBook to Nroff translation
  software producing incorrect Nroff output.  The man page no longer
  uses the &quot;.nse&quot; string which was being confused with the Nroff
  no-space mode command. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in which some NSE error messages were improperly escaped
  so that a message including &quot;c:\nmap&quot; would end up with a newline
  between &quot;c:&quot; and &quot;map&quot;.
</li><li>  Updated IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)
  generation. [Kris]
</li><li>  The DocBook XML source code to the Nmap Scripting Engine docs
  (<a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse.html">https://nmap.org/book/nse.html</a>) is now in SVN under docs/scripting.xml .

<li>  Improved Windows executable installer by making uninstall work better
  on systems which changed the default install path.  The shortcut is
  also now deleted properly on Vista. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  Windows installer is now generated using NSIS 2.34 rather than
  2.13. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Added UPnP-info NSE script by Thomas Buchanan. It gathers
  information from the UPnP service (UDP port 1900) which listens on
  many network devices such as routers, printers, and networked media
  players.
</li><li>  Fixed a --traceroute bug (assertion failure crash) which occurred
  when the first hop of the first host in a tracegroup (reference
  trace) times out.  Thanks to Sebasti&aacute;n Garc&iacute;a for the bug report and
  testing, and Eddie for the patch.
</li><li>  Fix a problem which prevented proper port number matching in
  NSE scripts (port_or_service function) due to a variable
  shadowing bug. [Sven Klemm]
</li><li>  Improved <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcinfo.html">rpcinfo</a>.nse to better sort and display available RPC

<li>  Fixed Nmap WinPcap installer to use CurrentVersion registry key on
  Windows rather than VersionNumber to more reliably detect Vista
  machines.  This should prevent the XP version of Packet.dll from
  being installed on Vista. [Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) now supports run-time interaction
  and the Nmap --host-timeout option. [Doug]
</li><li>  Added nmap.fetchfile() function for scripts so they can easily find
  Nmap&#39;s nmap-* data files (such as the OS/version detection DBs, port
  number mapping, etc.) [Kris]
</li><li>  Updated <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcinfo.html">rpcinfo</a>.nse to use nmap.fetchfile() to read from nmap-rpc
  instead of having a huge table of RPC numbers.  This reduced the
  script&#39;s size by nearly 75%. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed multiple NSE scripts that weren&#39;t always properly closing their
  sockets.  The error message was:
  &quot;bad argument #1 to &#39;close&#39; (nsock expected, got no value)&quot; [Kris]
</li><li>  Added a new version detection probe for the Trend Micro OfficeScan

<li>  David wrote a detailed Zenmap guide: <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html">https://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html</a>
</li><li>  Added <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcinfo.html">rpcinfo</a>.nse script, which contacts a listening RPC portmapper
  and reports the listening services and port information (like
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcinfo.html">rpcinfo</a> -p does).  The script was written by Sven Klemm.  Fyodor
  then enhanced the RPC number list with all of the entries from
  nmap-rpc.
</li><li>  Added a new NSE script (MySQLinfo) which prints MySQL server information
  such as the protocol and version numbers, status, thread id, capabilities,
  and password salt. [Kris]
</li><li>  Nmap&#39;s output options (-oA, -oX, etc.) now support strftime()-like
  conversions in the filename.  %H, %M, %S, %m, %d, %y, and %Y are
  all the same as in strftime().  %T is the same as %H%M%S, %R is the
  same as %H%M, and %D is the same as %m%d%y.  A % followed by any
  other character just yields that character (%% yields a %).  This
  means that &quot;-oX &#39;scan-%T-%D.xml&#39;&quot; uses an XML file in the form of
  &quot;scan-144840-121307.xml&quot;. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed WinPcap installer to install the right version of Packet.dll
  on Windows Vista. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Fixed our WinPcap installer so that it waits for a WinPcap uninstall
  (if needed) to complete before trying to install the new WinPcap.
  [Jah]
</li><li>  Fix a bunch of warning/error messages which contained an extra
  newline. [Brandon Enright]
</li><li>  Fixed an error when attempting to scan localhost as an unprivileged
  user on Windows (nmap --unprivileged localhost). The error was:
<pre>
    Skipping SYN Stealth Scan against localhost (127.0.0.1) because
    Windows does not support scanning your own machine (localhost) this
    way.
</pre>  Now connect scan is used instead of SYN scan. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that prevented the --resume option from working on
  Windows. The error message was:
  ..\utils.cc(996): CreateFileMapping(), file &#39;testresume&#39;, length 103,
  mflags 000 00006: The parameter is incorrect.(87)
  [Fixed by David, reported by Rob Nicholls]
</li><li>  Zenmap&#39;s new web page (<a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap">https://nmap.org/zenmap</a>/) is now shown in the
  Zenmap about dialogue.
</li><li>  On Windows, paths beginning with \ are now considered absolute when
  used with the --script option. jah (jah(a)zadkiel.plus.com) suggested
  this. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap no longer double-spaces its output (by inadvertently
  duplicating newlines) when viewing scan results that were saved to a
  file. [Joao Medeiros]
</li><li>  Upgraded the shipped LibPCRE from version 7.2 to 7.4. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed Zenmap crash that occurred when selecting Help from the Compare
  Results window. [Kris]
</li><li>  Updated robots.nse to prevent printing robots.txt comments. [Kris]
</li><li>  Many version detection match lines were improved to match even when
  newlines appear in binary data returned by the service. [Fixed by
  Doug, suggested by Lionel Cons]

<li>  David did a huge OS fingerprint integration marathon, going through
  all of your submissions (more than 1600) since August 20.  The 2nd
  generation database has grown more than 30% to 1,085 entries!  Many
  of the existing fingerprints were improved as well.  Notable new or
  greatly improved entries include the iPhone, iPod Touch, Mac OS X
  Leopard FreeBSD 7.0, Linux 2.6.23, Nokia cell phones (E61, E65, E70,
  E90, N95), and OpenBSD 4.2.  Of course there were all manner of new
  printers, cable/DSL routers, switches, enterprise routers, IP
  phones, cell phones and a heap of obscure equipment such as the
  BeaconMedaes medical gas alarm.  Windows Vista fingerprints were
  also improved significantly.  Please keep those OS fingerprint
  submissions and corrections coming!
</li><li>  Doug integrated all of your version detection fingerprints and
  corrections since October 4.  The DB now has an incredible 4,542
  signatures for 449 service protocols.  The service protocols with
  the most signatures are http (1,473), telnet (459), ftp (423), smtp
  (327), pop3 (188), http-proxy (111), ssh (104), imap (103), irc (46)
  and nntp (44).
</li><li>  Included the netbios-<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html">smb-os-discovery</a>.nse script which uses NetBIOS
  and SMB queries to guess OS version.  This script was written by
  Judy Novak and contributed by Sourcefire.
</li><li>  Canonicalized the interface type numbers used internally by
  libdnet. Also Libdnet now recognizes devices with type
  INTF_TYPE_IEEE80211 as Ethernet devices.  This ought to make
  wireless network scanning work on Windows Vista. For more background
  see <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q4/0391.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q4/0391.html</a> . [David]
</li><li>  Documented the &quot;--script all&quot; option in the man page and NSE
  article.  This option executes all scripts in the NSE database
  regardless of category. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  NSE scripts can now be specified by name without the .nse
  extension.  So instead of using &quot;--script
  bruteTelnet.nse,HTTPpasswd.nse,SQLInject.nse,robots.nse&quot;, you can
  just pass &quot;--script bruteTelnet,HTTPpasswd,SQLInject,robots&quot;. [Kris]
</li><li>  Removed some auto-generated files from the new nselib-bin directory
  as they could cause compatibility problems. Also updated
  mswin32/Makefile to reflect the new nselib-bin DLL location [David]
</li><li>  ripeQuery.nse was updated to avoid printing some useless
  information. [Kris]
</li><li>  Compatibility with systems that have the pcre.h header file in its
  own pcre directory should now be fixed for real. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Enhanced the radmind service detection signature and added a
  deprecated radmind port to nmap-services. [Matt Selsky]
</li><li>  Zenmap now gives better errors to stdout when it can&#39;t even pop up a
  dialog box (such as when PyGTK can&#39;t be loaded). [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a Zenmap crash which occurred on Mac OS X and possibly other
  platforms.  The error message said: &quot;object of type
  &#39;ScanHostDetailsPage&#39; has no len()&quot;. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a crash which occurred when an NSE script called
  set_port_version() at times that version scanning was not
  enabled. [Diman]
</li><li>  Fixed the NSIS installer so that it does not include some excess
  files (mswin32/* and .svn).  Thanks to Alan Jones for reporting the
  problem. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Renamed some Zenmap Python packages to allow Zenmap and Umit to be
  installed at the same time. [David]

<li>  Zenmap now has a man page!  It isn&#39;t very long yet, but covers the
  basics.  Thanks to David for writing this.
</li><li>  A new NSE script, promiscuous.nse, scans devices on a local network
  looking for sniffers (devices running in promiscuous mode).  This
  script is from Marek Majkowski and is the first to use the NSE pcap
  extension system (which he also wrote).  The script is only in the
  discovery category for now so it does not run by default.  Specify
  it by name for now.  We may make it default after the upcoming
  stable release.
</li><li>  Nmap can now handle IP aliases on Windows.  A given device such as
  eth0 might have several IP addresses.  Nmap will use the primary
  address, so you need to use -S if you want to specify a different
  one. [David]
</li><li>  An exception (rather than luaL_argerror) is now thrown when an SSL
  connection is attempted but OpenSSL isn&#39;t available. [David]
</li><li>  There is now an nmap.have_ssl NSE function so you can avoid doing
  NSE probes when SSL isn&#39;t available. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap gives clearer error messages when an import error occurs or
  Zenmap&#39;s dump files aren&#39;t found. [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap now looks for its data files relative to the directory of the
  zenmap script to allow running from the build/svn directory. [David]
</li><li>  NSE C modules are now installed into an nselib-bin directory.  This
  was needed to make the dns-test-open-recursion and zoneTrans NSE
  scripts work properly, since they use the NSE bit library
  (bit.so). [Diman, Fyodor]
</li><li>  Axillary autoconf scripts such as config.guess, config.sub,
  depcomp, install-sh, and ltmain.sh were deleted from Nmap
  subdirectories because configure is smart enough to use the ones from
  the parent directory.  This decreases the Nmap source tarball and svn
  checkout sizes. [David]
</li><li>  Nmap now compiles on systems which have the libPCRE include file in
  pcre/pcre.h rather than just pcre.h.  Thanks to Lionel Cons for the
  report. [Fyodor]
</li><li>  Nmap binary is now stripped again, but it now uses -x to avoid
  stripping dynamically loaded NSE functions on Mac OS X. [David]
</li><li>  Normalized Zenmap&#39;s handling of results files specified on the
  command line.  In some cases, Zenmap would ignore specified results
  files just because some unrelated options were used. [David]
</li><li>  configure.ac now uses literal directory names rather than variable
  references in calls to AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS.  This removes an annoying
  warning message which has existed for years when you regenerate
  configure. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a configure.ac error which prevented you from specifying an
  alternative libnsock directory. [David]
</li><li>  Check for Python in configure only if Zenmap is requested, and bail
  out if Zenmap is explicitly requested (--with-zenmap) and Python is
  not available. [David]
</li><li>  Removed some unimplemented Zenmap command-line options and function
  calls. [David]

<li>  Static code analysis company Coverity generously offered to scan the
  Nmap code base for flaws, and Kris volunteered to go through their
  report and fix the ones which were actual/possible problems rather
  than false positives.  Their system proved quite useful, and about a
  dozen potential problems were fixed.  For details, see Kris&#39;
  11/15/07 SVN commits.
</li><li>  Improved the Zenmap RPM file so that it should work on either Python
  2.4 or Python 2.5 machines.  It should also work on any platform (x86,
  x86_64, etc.) [David]
</li><li>  WinPcap updated from version 4.0.1 to the new 4.0.2 release. [David]
</li><li>  Added PPTP version detection NSE script (PPTPversion.nse) from
  Thomas Buchanan.  Nmap now ships with 38 NSE scripts.
</li><li>  A number of Solaris compilation fixes were added.  Hopefully it
  works for more Solaris users now. We also fixed an alignment issue
  which could cause a bus error on Solaris. [David]
</li><li>  When an NSE script changes the state of a port (e.g. from
  open|filtered to open), the --reason flag is now changed to
  &quot;script-set&quot;.  Also, the port state reason is now available to NSE
  scripts through a &quot;reason&quot; element in the port-table.  Thanks to
  Matthew Boyle for the patch.
</li><li>  When version detection changes the state of a port, the reason field
  is now updated as well (to udp-response or tcp-response as
  applicable).  Thanks to Thomas Buchanan for the patch.
</li><li>  Reworded an error message after a woman reported that it was &quot;highly
  offensive and sexist&quot;.  She also noted that &quot;times have changed and
  many women now use your software&quot; and &quot;a sexist remark like the one
  above should have no place in software.&quot;  The message was: &quot;TCP/IP
  fingerprinting (for OS scan) requires root privileges. Sorry,
  dude.&quot;.  I checked svn blame to call out the insensitive,
  chauvinistic jerk who wrote that error message, but it was me :).
</li><li>  We received a bug report through Debian entitled &quot;Nmap is a
  clairvoyant&quot; because when you run it with -v on September 1 1970, it
  reports &quot;Happy -27th Birthday to Nmap, may it live to be 73!&quot;.  We
  have decided that clairvoyance is a feature and ignored the report.
</li><li>  We no longer strip the Nmap binary before installing it, as that was
  leading to a runtime error on Mac OS X: &quot;lazy symbol binding failed:
  Symbol not found: _luaL_openlib&quot;.  Unfortunately, the unstripped
  Nmap binary can be much larger (e.g. 4MB vs. 800KB) so we are
  working on a better fix which allows us to continue stripping the
  binary on other platforms.
</li><li>  Zenmap configuration/customization files renamed from ~/.umit to
  ~/.zenmap and umit.conf to zenmap.conf, etc. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a Zenmap bug  where if you try to edit a profile and then
  click cancel, that profile ends up deleted. [Luis A. Bastiao]
</li><li>  The NSE shortport rules now allow for multiple matching states
  (e.g. open or open|filtered) to be specified. This silently failed
  before. [Eddie]
</li><li>  Regenerate configure scripts with Autoconf 2.61 and update
  config.guess and config.sub files with the latest versions from
  <a href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/config/?root">http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/config/?root</a>=config . [David]

<li>  NmapFE is now gone.  It had a good run as the default Nmap GUI
  for more than 8 years (since April 1999).  But after two years of
  development, Zenmap is ready to take its place.  Zenmap is portable
  and provides a much better interface to executing and (especially)
  viewing and analyzing Nmap results.  David did the honors of
  removing NmapFE.
</li><li>  We have lost another old friend as well:  1st generation OS
  detection system.  Nmap revolutionized OS detection when this was
  released in October 1998 and it served us well for more than 9 years
  as the database grew to 1,684 fingerprints.  But the 2nd generation
  system incorporates everything we learned during all those years and
  has proven itself even more effective.  I couldn&#39;t bear to kill this
  myself, so David did the dirty work.
</li><li>  There is no longer any artificial limit on the number of ports or
  protocols that can be used for host discovery. Port lists for ping
  scan now use the same syntax as the -p option except that T:, U:,
  and P: are not allowed. This means that you can do
<pre>
    nmap -PS1-1000 target
    nmap -PAhttp,https target
    nmap -PU&#39;[-]&#39; target
</pre>  [David]
</li><li>  Zenmap is now available packaged in RPM format.  Since Zenmap is
  written in Python, we no longer have to have separate x86 and x86_64
  versions like we did with NmapFE (and like we still do with
  Nmap). [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a crash (assertion failure) which could occur during ARP Ping
  scan [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed Zenmap so that it can handle asterisks in the command line
  (e.g. &quot;nmap 192.168.*.*&quot; or &quot;nmap -phttp* localhost&quot;) [David]
</li><li>  Change the Zenmap bug report dialogue to now give instructions for
  reporting issues to nmap-dev. [David]

  versions of PyGTK. [David]

  been migrated into the existing ultra_scan() system (which is used
  for port scanning too).  Thanks to David for doing the migration,
  which involved a lot of work and testing.  The new system is
  frequently faster and more accurate than massping(), and some of the
  new algorithms benefit port scans too.
</li><li>  Renamed Umit to Zenmap to reduce confusion between the version we
  ship with Nmap as the integrated GUI and the version maintained
  separately at umit.sourceforge.net.  We are excited about Zenmap and
  expect to remove NmapFE in the near future
</li><li>  Integrated all of your Q3 service detection submissions!  We have
  now surpassed 4500 signatures and are approaching 500 service
  protocols.  Wow!  Thanks to Doug for doing the integration.  His
  notes on the crazy and interesting services discovered this quarter
  are at <a href="http://hcsw.org/blog.pl/31">http://hcsw.org/blog.pl/31</a> .
</li><li>  Added a new ping type: IPProto Ping.  Use -PO (that is the letter O
  as in prOtOcOl, not a zero).  This is similar to protocol scan (-sO)
  in that it sends IP headers with different protocols in the hope of
  eliciting a response from targets.  The default is to send with
  protocols 1 (ICMP), 2 (IGMP), and 4 (IP-in-IP tunnel), but you can
  specify different protocol numbers on the command line the same way
  you specify TCP/UDP ports to -PS or -PU. To reduce confusion, we now
  recommend that -PN be used when you don&#39;t want pings done rather
  than using the old -P0 (zero). [Kris]
</li><li>  The SMTPcommands.nse script was updated to support the HELP query in
  addition to EHLO [Jasey DePriest]
</li><li>  Added --ttl support for connect() scans (-sT). [Kris]
</li><li>  Combine the Zenmap setup scripts into one portable setup.py rather
  than having separate versions for Windows, Unix, and Mac OS X.
</li><li>  Removed a bunch of unnecessary/incomplete code and data files from
  Zenmap. [David]
</li><li>  In Nbase, switched from GNU&#39;s getopt() replacement functions to
  Ben Sittler&#39;s BSD-licensed (but GNU compatible) functions. [Kris]
</li><li>  Include nmap.h in portreasons.h.  This fixes a compilation problem
  reported on OpenBSD. [David]
</li><li>  Change PCRE from an NSELib module back to statically linked code due
  to OpenBSD compilation problems.  See
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q4/0085.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q4/0085.html</a> [David]
</li><li>  Fix a problem with --reason printing the wrong host discovery
  reasons when ICMP destination unreachable packets arrived. [Kris]
</li><li>  Nmap has better dependency tracking now such that it no longer
  builds the executable every time you type &#39;make&#39;.  This was causing
  problems where &#39;make; sudo make install&#39; would create a root-owned
  nmap executable because it was rebuilt as part of &#39;make
  install&#39;. [David]
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.22SOC7 [2007-10-11] <a class="versionlink" id="4.22SOC7" href="#4.22SOC7" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Integrated all of your OS detection new fingerprint submissions and
  correction reports.  The grew more DB more than 18% to 825
  fingerprints.  Keep those submissions coming!  [David]
</li><li>  Made a number of significant improvements to host discovery
  algorithms for better performance and reliability. [David]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which prevented the first OS detection guess from being
  included in XML output.  This only applies when no exact matches
  were found.  Thanks to Martyn Tovey of Netcraft for reporting the
  problem and helping to track it down in the code.
</li><li>  Improve the script scan scheduling system to prevent the system from
  running out of sockets by executing too many scripts concurrently
  during large scans.  Thanks to Brandon Enright for finding the bug
  and Stoiko for fixing it.
</li><li>  Added nmap.verbosity() and nmap.debugging() functions for scripts to
  determine the Nmap verbosity/debugging level. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a crash (assertion error) which occurred when the first hop of
  the first system (reference trace) times out. [Eddie]
</li><li>  UMIT no longer rewrites a bunch of script files to replace variables
  such as VERSION and REVISION in the SVN working directory. [David,
  Adriano]
</li><li>  UMIT icon loading code simplified and made platform
  independent. [David]
</li><li>  Removed PIL dependency from UMIT package generation system.  We now
  use GTK to put the version number in the splash screen. [Adriano]
</li><li>  UMIT no longer crashes just because documentation files are
  missing. [Adriano]
</li><li>  Removed unnecessary recent_scans.txt and target_list.txt files from
  UMIT. Some unnecessary copies of Nmap data files were removed as
  well. [David, Adriano]
</li><li>  Updated the *.dmp preprocessed Nmap data files used by UMIT, and
  also updated the scripts used to create them. [David]
</li><li>  WinPcap installer was updated so that on Windows Vista it uses a
  different Packet.dll and omits WanPacket.dll. [Eddie]
</li><li>  Unix installation now places NSELib dynamic libraries in &#39;libexec&#39;
  rather than &#39;share&#39; directories, since they are architecture
  dependent.  Thanks to Christoph J. Thompson for the patch.
</li><li>  Fix bug related to users providing custom libpcre location to
  configure (reported by Daniel Johnson, fixed by Stoiko).  A patch
  from Marek Majkowski which caps the number of sockets opened by NSE
  scripts was also applied.
</li><li>  The UMIT version number is automatically updated to be the same as
  the Nmap version number rather than always being 0.9.4. [David]
</li><li>  UMIT now sorts port numbers numerically rather than alphabetically
  [Adriano]
</li><li>  Three UMIT data files (options.xml, profile_editor.xml, and
  wizard.xml) are installed in the shared UMIT data directory
  (e.g. /usr/share/umit/misc) rather than in every user&#39;s ~/.umit
  directory. [David]
</li><li>  Added HTTPtrace demo NSE script by Kris, who also updated his
  HTTPpasswd script.
</li><li>  A bunch of capitalization/spelling canonicalization changes were
  made to Nmap output. For example: ftp to FTP and idlescan to
  idle scan.
</li><li>  Made some improvements to the nmap.xsl stylesheet for converting
  Nmap XML results to HTML reports.  It now does a better job at
  removing empty sections and headers. Thanks to Henrik Lund Kramshoej
  for the patch.
</li><li>  Updated nmap-mac-prefixes with the latest IEEE data.
</li><li>  Disabled auto-generation of libpcre/pcre_chartables.c because that
  was useless for our purposes and could also cause some version
  control related problems. [David]
</li><li>  Updated IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)
  generation. [Kris]

<li>  Included David&#39;s major massping migration project.  The same
  underlying engine is now used for ping scanning as for port
  scanning.  We hope this will lead to better performance and
  accuracy, as well as helping to de-bloat Nmap.  Please test it out
  and report your results to nmap-dev!  For more details, see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q3/0277.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q3/0277.html</a>
</li><li>  Fixed UMIT bug which occurred when installing to a non-standard
  directory (e.g. a home directory).  This caused Python to not be able
  to find the necessary files. [Kris]
</li><li>  Added an NSE script (HTTPpasswd.nse) for finding directory traversal
  problems and /etc/password files on web servers. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed an error related to version scans against SSL services on
  UNIX.  The error said &quot;nsock_connect_ssl called - but nsock was
  built w/o SSL support. QUITTING&quot;.  Thanks to Jasey DePriest for
  tracking down the problem and David Fifield for fixing it.
</li><li>  Removed win_dependencies cruft from UMIT directory. [Kris]
</li><li>  Upgraded Libpcap from version 0.9.4 to 0.9.7 [Kris]
</li><li>  Removed the effectively empty XML elements for traceroute hops which
  timed out. [Eddie]
</li><li>  Fixed (I hope) a problem with running Nmap on Mac OS X machines with
  VMWare Fusion running.  The error message started with:
  &quot;getinterfaces: Failed to open ethernet interface (vmnet8). A
  possible cause on BSD operating systems is running out of BPF
  devices ....&quot;  For more details, see
  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q3/0254.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q3/0254.html</a> .
</li><li>  Check that --script arguments are reasonable when Nmap starts rather
  than potentially waiting for a bunch of port scanning to finish
  first. [Stoiko]
</li><li>  Fixed (we hope) a UMIT problem which resulted in the error message:
  &quot;NameError: global name &#39;S_IRUSR&#39; is not defined&quot;. [Adriano]
</li><li>  Removed an error message which used to appear when you quit UMIT on
  Windows.  The message used to say &quot;Errors occurred - See the logfile
  [filename] for details.&quot; [Adriano]
</li><li>  Fix permissions on files installed by Umit so that it should work
  even if you do &#39;make install&#39; from an account with a 077 umask.
</li><li>  Add a feature to Umit that lets you search your unsaved
  scans. [Eddie]
</li><li>  Added back a previously removed feature which allows you to specify
  &#39;rnd&#39; as one of your decoys (-D option) to let Nmap choose a random
  IP.  You also use a format such as rnd:5 to generate five random
  decoys. [Kris]
</li><li>  Reference guide (man page) updates to the NSE section, and some
  general cleanup.
</li><li>  When Nmap finishes, it now says &quot;Nmap done&quot; rather than &quot;Nmap run
  completed&quot;.  No need to waste pixels on excess verbiage.

<li>  The Windows installer should actually install UMIT properly now.
</li><li>  Remove umit.db from the installation process.  Let Umit create a new
  one on its own when needed.
</li><li>  Fixed the UMIT portion of the Windows installer build system to
  detect certain heinous errors (like not being able to find Python)
  and bail out. [Kris]
</li><li>  Prevent scripts directory from containing .svn cruft when using the
  Win32 installer (thanks to David Fifield for the patch).
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 4.22SOC3 [2007-8-16] <a class="versionlink" id="4.22SOC3" href="#4.22SOC3" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Umit is now included in the Nmap Windows executable installer.
  Please give it a try and let us know what you think!  Kris put a lot
  of work into getting this set up.
</li><li>  Added four new NSE scripts: HTTP proxy detection (Arturo &#39;Buanzo&#39;
  Busleiman), DNS zone transfer attempt (Eddie), detecting SQL
  injection vulnerabilities on web sites (Eddie), and fetching and
  displaying portions of /robots.txt from web servers (Eddie).
</li><li>  All of your 2nd Quarter 2007 Nmap version detection fingerprints
  were integrated by Doug.  The DB now contains 4,347 signatures for
  439 service protocols.  Doug describes the highlights (craziest
  services found) in his integration report at
  <a href="http://hcsw.org/blog.pl/29">http://hcsw.org/blog.pl/29</a> .
</li><li>  NSE now supports raw IP packet sending and receiving thanks to a
  patch from Marek Majkowski.  Diman handled testing and applied the
  patch.
</li><li>  Nmap now has Snprintf() and Vsnprintf() as safer alternatives to the
  standard version.  The problem is that the Windows version of these
  functions (_snprintf, _vsnprintf) doesn&#39;t properly terminate strings
  when it has to truncate them.  These wrappers ensure that the string
  written is always truncated.  Thanks to Kris for doing the work.
</li><li>  Upgraded libpcre from version 6.7 to 7.2 [Kris]
</li><li>  Merged various Umit bug fixes from SourceForge trunk: &quot;missing import
  webbrowser on umit&quot;, &quot;Missing markup in &#39;OS Class&#39; on
  HostDetailsPage&quot;, &quot;some command line options are now working
  (target, profile, verbose, open result file and run an nmap
  command)&quot;, &quot;removing unused functions import from os.path&quot;,
  &quot;verbosity works on command line&quot;
</li><li>  Eddie fixed several Umit bugs.  Umit now sets the file save
  extension to .usr unless the user specifies something else. The
  details highlight regular expression was improved and an error message was added
  when no target was specified and -iR and -iL aren&#39;t used.
</li><li>  reason.cc/reason.h renamed to portreasons.cc/.h because a reason.h
  in the Windows platform SDK was causing conflicts. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in --iflist which would lead to crashes.  Thanks to
  Michael Lawler for the report, and Eddie for the fix.
</li><li>  Finished updating WinPcap to 4.01 (a few static libraries were
  missed) [Eddie]
</li><li>  Added NSE support for buffered data reads. [Stoiko]
</li><li>  Added new --script-args option for passing arguments to NSE scripts
  [Stoiko]
</li><li>  Performed a bunch of OS fingerprint text canonicalization thanks to
  reports of dozens of capitalization inconsistencies from Suicidal Bob.
</li><li>  Fixed an assertion failure which could be experienced when script
  scan was requested without also requesting version scan. [Stoiko]
</li><li>  Fixed an output bug on systems like Windows which return -1 when
  vsnprintf is passed a too-small buffer rather than returning the
  size needed.  Thanks to jah (jah(a)zadkiel.plus.com) for the report.
</li><li>  Added sys/types.h include to portreasons.h to help OpenBSD compilation.
  Thanks to Olivier Meyer for the patch.
</li><li>  Many hard coded function names and instances of __FUNCTION__ were
  changed to __func__ [Kris]
</li><li>  Configure scripts for Nmap, Nbase, and Nsock were optimized to
  remove redundant checks.  This improves compilation time
  performance. [Eddie]
</li><li>  Updated IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR)
  generation. [Kris]

<li>  The UMIT graphical Nmap frontend is now included (as an ALPHA TEST
  release) with the Nmap tarball distribution.  It isn&#39;t yet in the
  RPMs or the Windows distributions.  UMIT is written with Python/GTK
  and has many huge advantages over NmapFE.  It installs from the Nmap
  source tarballs as part of the &quot;make install&quot; process unless you
  specify --without-umit to configure.  Please give UMIT a try (the
  executable is named umit) and let us know the results!  We hope to
  include UMIT in the Windows Nmap distributions soon.
</li><li>  Added more Nmap Scripting Engine scripts, bringing the total to 31.
  The new ones are bruteTelnet (Eddie Bell), SMTPcommands (Jasey
  DePriest), iax2Detect (Jasey), <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nbstat.html">nbstat</a> (Brandon Enright),
  SNMPsysdescr (Thomas Buchanan), HTTPAuth (Thomas), <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/finger.html">finger</a> (Eddie),
  ircServerInfo (Doug Hoyte), and MSSQLm (Thomas Buchanan).
</li><li>  Added the --reason option which explains WHY Nmap assigned a port
  status.  For example, a port could be listed as &quot;filtered&quot; because
  no response was received, or because an ICMP network unreachable
  message was received. [Eddie]
</li><li>  Integrated all of your 2nd generation OS detection submissions,
  increasing the database size by 68% since 4.21ALPHA4 to 699
  fingerprints.  The 2nd generation database is now nearly half (42%)
  the size of the original.  Please keep those submissions coming so
  that we can do another integration round before the SoC program ends
  on August 20!  Thanks to David Fifield for doing most of the
  integration work!
</li><li>  Integrated version detection submissions.  The database has grown by
  more than 350 signatures since 4.21ALPHA4.  Nmap now has 4,236
  signatures for 432 service protocols.  As usual, Doug Hoyte deserves
  credit for the integration marathon, which he describes at
  <a href="http://hcsw.org/blog.pl">http://hcsw.org/blog.pl</a> .
</li><li>  Added the NSE library (NSELib) which is a library of useful
  functions (which can be implemented in LUA or as loadable C/C++
  modules) for use by NSE scripts.  We already have libraries for bit
  operations (bit), list operations (listop), URL fetching and
  manipulation (url), activation rules (shortport), and miscellaneous
  commonly useful functions (stdnse).  Stoiko added the underlying
  functionality, though numerous people contributed to the library
  routines.
</li><li>  Added --servicedb and --versiondb command-line options which allow
  you to specify a custom Nmap services (port to port number translation
  and port frequency) file or version detection database. [David
  Fifield]
</li><li>  The build dependencies were dramatically reduced by removing
  unnecessary header includes and moving header includes from .h
  files to .cc as well as adding some forward declarations.  This
  reduced the number of makefile.dep dependencies from 1469 to 605.
  This should make Nmap compilation faster and prevent some
  portability problems. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Upgraded from WinPcap 3.1 to WinPcap 4.01 and fixed a WinPcap installer
  error. [Eddie]
</li><li>  In verbose mode, Nmap now reports where it obtains data files (such as
  nmap-services) from. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  Canonicalized a bunch of OS classes, device types, etc. in the OS
  detection and version scanning databases so they are named
  consistently. [Doug]
</li><li>  If we get a ICMP Protocol Unreachable from a host other than our
  target during a port scan, we set the state to &#39;filtered&#39; rather than
  &#39;closed&#39;. This is consistent with how port unreachable errors work for
  udp scan. [Kris]
</li><li>  Relocated OSScan warning message (could not find 1 closed and 1 open
  port). Now output.cc prints the warning along with a targets OSScan
  results. [Eddie]
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which caused port 0 to be improperly used for gen1 OS
  detection in some cases when your scan includes port 0 (it isn&#39;t
  included by default).  Thanks to Sebastian Wolfgarten for the report
  and Kris Katterjohn for the fix.
</li><li>  The --iflist table now provides WinPcap device names on
  Windows. [Eddie]
</li><li>  The Nmap reference guide (man page) DocBook XML source is now in the
  SVN repository at svn://svn.insecure.org/nmap/docs/refguide.xml .
</li><li>  NSE now has garbage collection so that if you forget to close a
  socket before exiting a script, it is closed for you. [Stoiko]
</li><li>  The &lt;portused&gt; tag in XML output now provides the open TCP port used
  for OS detection as well as the closed TCP and UDP ports which were
  reported previously. [Kris]
</li><li>  XML output now has a &lt;times&gt; tag for reporting final time
  information which was already printed in normal output in verbose
  mode (round trip time, rtt variance, timeout, etc.) [Kris]
</li><li>  Changed the XML output format so that the &lt;extrareasons&gt; tag (part
  of Eddie&#39;s --reason patch) falls within the &lt;extraports&gt; tag. [Kris]
</li><li>  Nmap now provides more concise OS fingerprints for submission thanks
  to better merging. [David Fifield]
</li><li>  A number of changes were made to the Windows build system to handle
  version numbers, publisher field, add/remove program support,
  etc. [Eddie]
</li><li>  The Nmap -A option now enables the traceroute option too [Eddie]
</li><li>  Improved how the Gen1 OS Detection system selects which UDP ports to
  send probes to.  [Kris]
</li><li>  Updated nmap-mac-prefixes to latest IEEE data as of 5/18/07. Also
  removed some high (greater than 0x80) characters from some company
  names because they were causing this error on Windows when Nmap is
  compiled in Debug mode:
  isctype.c Line 56: Expression: (unsigned)(c + 1) &lt;= 256&quot;.
  Thanks to Sina Bahram for the initial report and Thomas Buchanan for
  tracking down the problem.
</li><li>  Added a SIP (IP phone) probe from Matt Selsky to nmap-service-probes.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which prevented the NSE scripts directory from appearing
  in the Win32 .zip version of Nmap.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in --traceroute output.  It occurred when a traced host could
  be fully consolidated, but only the first hop number was outputted. [Kris]
</li><li>  The new &quot;rnd&quot; option to -D allows you to ask Nmap to generate random
  decoy IPs rather having to specify them all yourself. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a Traceroute bug relating to scanning through the localhost
  interface on Windows (which previously caused a crash).  Thanks to
  Alan Jones for the report and Eddie Bell for the fix.
</li><li>  Fixed a traceroute bug related to tracing between interfaces of a
  multi-homed host.  Thanks to David Fifield for reporting the problem
  and Eddie Bell for the fix.
</li><li>  Service detection (-sV) and OS detection (-O) are now (rightfully)
  disabled when used with the IPProto Scan (-sO).  Using the Service
  Scan like this led to premature exiting, and the OS Scan led to gross
  inaccuracies.  [Kris]
</li><li>  Updated IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR) generation. [Kris]

  Thanks to Joshua Abraham for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed a small bug in traceroute progress output which didn&#39;t
  properly indicate completion. [Kris]
</li><li>  Fixed a portability problem related to the new traceroute
  functionality so that it compiles on Mac OS X.  Thanks to Christophe
  Thil for reporting the problem and sending the 1-line fix.

<li>  Performed a huge OS detection submission integration marathon.  More
  than 500 submissions were processed, increasing the 2nd generation
  OS DB size 65% to 381 fingerprints.  And many of the existing ones
  were improved.  We still have a bit more than 500 submissions (sent
  after January 16) to process.  Please keep those submissions coming!
</li><li>  Integrated all of your Q32006 service fingerprint submissions.  The
  nmap-service-probe DB grew from 3,671 signatures representing 415
  service protocols to 3,877 signatures representing 426 services.  Big
  thanks to version detection czar Doug Hoyte for doing this.  Notable
  changes are described at <a href="http://hcsw.org/blog.pl?a">http://hcsw.org/blog.pl?a</a>=20&amp;b=20 .
</li><li>  Nmap now has traceroute support, thanks to an excellent patch by
  Eddie Bell. The new system uses Nmap data to determine which sort of
  packets are most likely to slip through the target network and
  produce useful results.  The system is well optimized for speed and
  bandwidth efficiency, and the clever output system avoids repeating
  the same initial hops for each target system.  Enable this
  functionality by specifying --traceroute.
</li><li>  Nmap now has a public Subversion (SVN) source code repository.  See
  the announcement at <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q4/0253.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q4/0253.html</a>

  <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q4/0281.html">http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q4/0281.html</a> .
</li><li>  Fixed a major accuracy bug in gen1 OS detection (some debugging code
  was accidentally left in).  Thanks to Richard van den Berg for finding
  the problem.
</li><li>  Changed the IP protocol scan so that it sends proper IGMP headers when
  scanning that protocol.  This makes it much more likely that the host
  will respond, proving that it&#39;s &quot;open&quot;.  [Kris]
</li><li>  Improved the algorithm for classifying the TCP timestamp frequency
  for OS detection.  The new algorithm is described at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html#osdetect-ts">https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html#osdetect-ts</a> .
</li><li>  Fixed the way Nmap detects whether one of its data files (such as
  nmap-services) exists and has permissions which allow it to be read.
</li><li>  Added a bunch of nmap-services port listings from Stephanie Wen.
</li><li>  Update IANA assignment IP list for random IP (-iR) generation.
  Thanks to Kris Katterjohn for the patch.
</li><li>  Fix nmap.xsl (the transform for rendering Nmap XML results as HTML)
  to fix some bugs related to OS detection output.  Thanks to Tom
  Sellers for the patch.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which prevented the --without-liblua compilation option
  from working.  Thanks to Kris Katterjohn for the patch.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which caused nmap --iflist to crash (and might have
  caused crashes in other circumstances too).  Thanks to Kris
  Katterjohn for the report and Diman Todorov for the fix.
</li><li>  Applied a bunch of code cleanup patches from Kris Katterjohn.
</li><li>  Some scan types were fixed when used against localhost. The UDP Scan
  doesn&#39;t find its own port, the TCP Scan won&#39;t print a message (with -d)
  about an unexpected packet (for the same reason), and the IPProto Scan
  won&#39;t list every port as &quot;open&quot; when using --data-length &gt;= 8.  [Kris]
</li><li>  The IPProto Scan should be more accurate when scanning protocol 17 (UDP).
  ICMP Port Unreachables are now checked for, and UDP is listed as &quot;open&quot;
  if it receives one rather than &quot;open|filtered&quot; or &quot;filtered&quot;.  [Kris]
</li><li>  The --scanflags option now also accepts &quot;ECE&quot;, &quot;CWR&quot;, &quot;ALL&quot; and &quot;NONE&quot; as
  arguments.  [Kris]
</li><li>  The --packet-trace option was added to NmapFE.  The Ordered Ports (-r)
  option in now available to non-root users on NmapFE as well. [Kris]

<li>  Integrated the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) into mainline Nmap.
  Diman Todorov and I have been working on this for more than six months, and
  we hope it will expand Nmap&#39;s capabilities in many cool ways.  We&#39;re
  accepting (and writing) general purpose scripts to put into Nmap
  proper, and you can also write personal scripts to deal with issues
  specific to your environment.  The system is documented at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse.html">https://nmap.org/book/nse.html</a> .
</li><li>  Updated nmap-mac-prefixes to reflect the latest OUI DB from the IEEE

<li>  Integrated the latest OS fingerprint submissions.  The 2nd
  generation DB size has grown to 231 fingerprints.  Please keep them
  coming!  New fingerprints include Mac OS X Server 10.5 pre-release,
  NetBSD 4.99.4, Windows NT, and much more.
</li><li>  Fixed a segmentation fault in the new OS detection system
  which was reported by Craig Humphrey and Sebastian Garcia.
</li><li>  Fixed a TCP sequence prediction difficulty indicator bug. The index
  is supposed to go from 0 (&quot;trivial joke&quot;) to about 260 (OpenBSD).
  But some systems generated ISNs so insecurely that Nmap went
  berserk and reported a negative difficulty index.  This generally
  only affects some printers, crappy cable modems, and Microsoft
  Windows (old versions).  Thanks to Sebastian Garcia for helping me
  track down the problem.

  New fingerprints include versions of z/OS, OpenBSD, Linux, AIX,
  FreeBSD, Cisco CatOS, IPSO firewall, and a slew of printers and
  misc. devices.  We also got our first Windows 95 fingerprint,
  submitted anonymously of course :).
</li><li>  Fixed (I hope) the &quot;getinterfaces: intf_loop() failed&quot; error which
  was seen on Windows Vista.  The problem was apparently in
  intf-win32.c of libdnet (need to define MIB_IF_TYPE_MAX to
  MAX_IF_TYPE rather than 32).  Thanks to Dan Griffin
  (dan(a)jwsecure.com) for tracking this down!
</li><li>  Applied a couple minor bug fixes for IP options
  support and packet tracing.  Thanks to Michal Luczaj
  (regenrecht(a)o2.pl) for reporting them.

  the Apple Airport Express, Windows Vista RC1, OpenBSD 4.0, a Sony

  obscure submissions like Minix 3.1.2a and &quot;Ember InSight Adapter for
  programming EM2XX-family embedded devices&quot;.  Who doesn&#39;t have a few

<li>  Integrated the newly submitted OS fingerprints. The DB now contains
  71 fingerprints, up 27% from 56 in ALPHA8.  Please keep them coming!
  We still only have 4.2% as many fingerprints as the gen1 database.
</li><li>  Added the --open option, which causes Nmap to show only open ports.
  Ports in the states &quot;open|closed&quot; and &quot;unfiltered&quot; might be open, so
  those are shown unless the host has an overwhelming number of them.
</li><li>  Nmap gen2 OS detection used to always do 2 retries if it fails to
  find a match.  Now it normally does just 1 retry, but does 4 retries
  if conditions are good enough to warrant fingerprint submission.
  This should speed things up on average.  A new --max-os-tries option
  lets you specify a higher lower maximum number of tries.
</li><li>  Added --unprivileged option, which is the opposite of --privileged.
  It tells Nmap to treat the user as lacking network raw socket and
  sniffing privileges.  This is useful for testing, debugging, or when
  the raw network functionality of your operating system is somehow
  broken.
</li><li>  Fixed a confusing error message which occurred when you specified a
  ping scan or list scan, but also specified -p (which is only used for
  port scans).  Thanks to Thomas Buchanan for the patch.

</li><li>  Nmap 2nd generation OS detection now has a more sophisticated
  mechanism for guessing a target OS when there is no exact match in the
  database (see <a href="https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-guess.html">https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-guess.html</a> )
</li><li>  Rewrote mswin32/nmap.rc to remove cruft and hopefully reduce some
  MFC-related compilation problems we&#39;ve seen.  Thanks to KX
  (kxmail(a)gmail.com) for doing this.
</li><li>  NmapFE now uses a spin button for verbosity and debugging options so
  that you can specify whatever verbosity (-v) or debugging (-d) level
  you desire.  The --randomize-hosts option was also added to NmapFE.
  Thanks to Kris Katterjohn for the patches.
</li><li>  A dozen or so small patches to Nmap and NmapFE by Kris Katterjohn.
</li><li>  Removed libpcap/Win32 and libpcap/msdos as Nmap doesn&#39;t use them.

<li>  Did a bunch of Nmap 2nd generation fingerprint integration work.

<li>  Worked with Zhao to improve the new OS detection system with
  better algorithms, probe changes, and bug fixes.  We&#39;re
  now ready to start growing the new database!  If Nmap gives you
  fingerprints, please submit them at the given URL.  The DB is still
  extremely small.  The new system is extensively documented at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html">https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html</a> .
</li><li>  Nmap now supports IP options with the new --ip-options flag.  You
  can specify any options in hex, or use &quot;R&quot; (record route), &quot;T&quot;
  (record timestamp), &quot;U&quot;) (record route &amp; timestamp), &quot;S [route]&quot;
  (strict source route), or &quot;L [route]&quot; (loose source route).  Specify
  --packet-trace to display IP options of responses.  For further
  information and examples, see <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man.html">https://nmap.org/book/man.html</a> and

  submissions.  Please keep them coming!  We now have 3,671 signatures
  representing 415 protocols.   Thanks to version detection czar Doug
  Hoyte for doing this.
</li><li>  Nmap now uses the (relatively) new libpcap pcap_get_selectable_fd
  API on systems which support it.  This means that we no longer need
  to hack the included Pcap to better support Linux.  So Nmap will now
  link with an existing system libpcap by default on that platform if
  one is detected.  Thanks to Doug Hoyte for the patch.
</li><li>  Updated the included libpcap from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4.  The changes I
  made are in libpcap/NMAP_MODIFICATIONS .  By default, Nmap will now
  use the included libpcap unless version 0.9.4 or greater is already
  installed on the system.
</li><li>  Applied some nsock bugfixes from Diman Todorov.  These don&#39;t affect
  the current version of Nmap, but are important for his Nmap
  Scripting Engine, which I hope to integrate into mainline Nmap in
  September.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which would occasionally cause Nmap to crash with the
  message &quot;log_vwrite: write buffer not large enough&quot;.  I thought I
  conquered it in a previous release -- thanks to Doug Hoyte for finding a
  corner case which proved me wrong.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in the rDNS system which prevented us from querying
  certain authoritative DNS servers which have recursion explicitly
  disabled.  Thanks to Doug Hoyte for the patch.
</li><li>  --packet-trace now reports TCP options (thanks to Zhao Lei for the
  patch).  Thanks to the --ip-options addition also found in this
  release, IP options are printed too.
</li><li>  Cleaned up Nmap DNS reporting to be a little more useful and
  concise.  Thanks to Doug Hoyte for the patch.
</li><li>  Applied a bunch of small internal cleanup patches by Kris Katterjohn
  (katterjohn(a)gmail.com).

  do so.  Thanks to Adam Vartanian (flooey(a)gmail.com) for the patch.
</li><li>  Applied several code cleanup patches from Marek Majkowski.
</li><li>  Added --release-memory option, which causes Nmap to release all
  accessible memory buffers before quitting (rather than let the OS do
  it).  This is only useful for debugging memory leaks.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug related to bogus completion time estimates when you
  request an estimate (through runtime interaction) right when Nmap is
  starting a subsystem (such as a port scan or version detection).
  Thanks to Diman Todorov for reporting the problem and Doug Hoyte for
  writing a fix.
</li><li>  Nmap no longer gets random numbers from OpenSSL when it is available
  because that turned out to be slower than Nmap&#39;s other methods
  (e.g. /dev/urandom on Linux, /dev/arandom on OpenBSD, etc.).  Thanks
  to Marek Majkowski for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Updated the Windows binary distributions (self-installer and .zip)

  suggested by Robert Millan (rmh(a)aybabtu.com).
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which could cause false &quot;open&quot; ports when doing a UDP
  scan of localhost. This usually only happened when you scan tens of
  thousands of ports (e.g. -p- option).
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in service detection which could lead to a crash when
  &quot;--version-intensity 0&quot; was used with a UDP scan.  Thanks to Makoto
  Shiotsuki (shio(a)st.rim.or.jp) for reporting the problem and Doug

  contrasts with the old format which showed all ports together in
  numerical order, regardless of protocol.  This was at first a &quot;bug&quot;,
  but then I started thinking this behavior may be better.  If you
  have a preference for one format or the other, please post your
  reasons to nmap-dev.

<li>  Integrated all of your submissions (about a thousand) from the first
  quarter of this year!  Please keep &#39;em coming!  The DB has increased
  from 3,153 signatures representing 381 protocols in 4.03 to 3,441
  signatures representing 401 protocols.  No other tool comes close!
  Many of the already existing match lines were improved too.  Thanks
  to Version Detection Czar Doug Hoyte for doing this.
</li><li>  Nmap now allows multiple ignored port states.  If a 65K-port scan
  had, 64K filtered ports, 1K closed ports, and a few dozen open
  ports, Nmap used to list the dozen open ones among a thousand lines
  of closed ports.  Now Nmap will give reports like &quot;Not shown: 64330
  filtered ports, 1000 closed ports&quot; or &quot;All 2051 scanned ports on
  192.168.0.69 are closed (1051) or filtered (1000)&quot;, and omit all of
  those ports from the table.  Open ports are never ignored.  XML
  output can now have multiple &lt;extraports&gt; directive (one for each
  ignored state).  The number of ports in a single state before it is
  consolidated defaults to 26 or more, though that number increases as
  you add -v or -d options.  With -d3 or higher, no ports will be
  consolidated.  The XML output should probably be augmented to give
  the extraports directive &#39;ip&#39;, &#39;tcp&#39;, and &#39;udp&#39; attributes which
  specify the corresponding port numbers in the given state in the
  same listing format as the nmaprun.scaninfo.services attribute, but
  that part hasn&#39;t yet been implemented.  If you absolutely need the
  exact port numbers for each state in the XML, use -d3 for now.
</li><li>  Nmap now ignores certain ICMP error message rate limiting (rather
  than slowing down to accommodate it) in cases such as SYN scan where
  an ICMP message and no response mean the same thing (port filtered).
  This is currently only done at timing level Aggressive (-T4) or
  higher, though we may make it the default if we don&#39;t hear problems
  with it.  In addition, the --defeat-rst-ratelimit option has been
  added, which causes Nmap not to slow down to accommodate RST rate
  limits when encountered.  For a SYN scan, this may cause closed
  ports to be labeled &#39;filtered&#39; because Nmap refused to slow down
  enough to correspond to the rate limiting.  Learn more about this
  new option at <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man.html">https://nmap.org/book/man.html</a> .  Thanks to Martin
  Macok (martin.macok(a)underground.cz) for writing the patch that
  these changes were based on.
</li><li>  Moved my Nmap development environment to Visual C++ 2005 Express
  edition.  In typical &quot;MS Upgrade Treadmill&quot; fashion, Visual Studio
  2003 users will no longer be able to compile Nmap using the new
  solution files.  The compilation, installation, and execution
  instructions at <a href="https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html">https://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html</a> have been
  upgraded.
</li><li>  Automated my Windows build system so that I just have to type a
  single make command in the mswin32 directory.  Thanks to Scott
  Worley (smw(a)pobox.com&gt;, Shane &amp; Jenny Walters
  (yfisaqt(a)waltersinamerica.com), and Alex Prinsier
  (aphexer(a)mailhaven.com) for reading my appeal in the 4.03
  CHANGELOG and assisting.
</li><li>  Changed the PortList class to use much more efficient data
  structures and algorithms which take advantage of Nmap-specific
  behavior patterns.  Thanks to Marek Majkowski
  (majek(a)forest.one.pl) for the patch.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug which prevented certain TCP+UDP scan commands, such as
  &quot;nmap -sSU -p1-65535 localhost&quot; from scanning both TCP and UDP.
  Instead they gave the error message &quot;WARNING: UDP scan was requested,
  but no udp ports were specified.  Skipping this scan type&quot;.  Thanks to
  Doug Hoyte for the patch.
</li><li>  Nmap has traditionally required you to specify -T* timing options
  before any more granular options like --max-rtt-timeout, otherwise the
  general timing option would overwrite the value from your more
  specific request.  This has now been fixed so that the more specific
  options always have precedence.  Thanks to Doug Hoyte for this patch.
</li><li>  Fixed a couple possible memory leaks reported by Ted Kremenek
  (kremenek(a)cs.stanford.edu) from the Stanford University software
  static analysis lab (&quot;Checker&quot; project).
</li><li>  Nmap now prints a warning when you specify a target name which
  resolves to multiple IP addresses.  Nmap proceeds to scan only the
  first of those addresses (as it always has done).  Thanks to Doug
  Hoyte for the patch.  The warning looks like this:
  Warning: Hostname google.com resolves to 3 IPs. Using 66.102.7.99.
</li><li>  Disallow --host-timeout values of less than 1500ms, print a warning
  for values less than 15s.
</li><li>  Changed all instances of inet_aton() into calls to inet_pton()
  instead.  This allowed us to remove inet_aton.c from nbase.  Thanks to
  KX (kxmail(a)gmail.com) for the patch.
</li><li>  When debugging (-d) is specified, Nmap now prints a report on the
  timing variables in use.  Thanks to Doug Hoyte for the patch.  The
  report loos like this:
<pre>
   ---------- Timing report ----------
     hostgroups: min 1, max 100000
     rtt-timeouts: init 250, min 50, max 300
     scan-delay: TCP 5, UDP 1000
     parallelism: min 0, max 0
     max-retries: 2, host-timeout 900000
   -----------------------------------</pre>
</li><li>  Modified the WinPcap installer file to explicitly uninstall an
  existing WinPcap (if you select that you wish to replace it) rather
  than just overwriting the old version.  Thanks to Doug Hoyte for
  making this change.
</li><li>  Added some P2P application ports to the nmap-services file.  Thanks
  to Martin Macok for the patch.
</li><li>  The write buffer length increased in 4.03 was increased even further
  when the debugging or verbosity levels are more than 2 (e.g. -d3).
  Thanks to Brandon Enright (bmenrigh(a)ucsd.edu) for the patch.  The
  goal is to prevent you from ever seeing the fatal error:
  &quot;log_vwrite: write buffer not large enough -- need to increase&quot;
</li><li>  Added a note to the Nmap configure dragon that people sick of him
  can submit their own ASCII art to dev@nmap.org .  If you
  are wondering WTF I am talking about, it is probably because only
  most elite Nmap users -- the ones who compile from source on UNIX --
  get to see the &#39;l33t ASCII Art.

<li>  Updated the LibPCRE build system to add the -fno-thread-jumps option
  to gcc when compiling on the new Intel-based Apple Mac OS X systems.
  Hopefully this resolves the version detection crashes that several
  people have reported on such systems.  Thanks to Kurt Grutzmacher
  (grutz(a)jingojango.net) for sending the configure.ac patch.
</li><li>  Made some portability fixes to keep Nmap compiling with the newest
  Visual Studio 2005.  Thanks to KX (kxmail(a)gmail.com) for
  suggesting them.
</li><li>  Service fingerprints are now provided in the XML output whenever
  they would appear in the interactive output (i.e. when a service
  response with data but is unrecognized).  They are shown in a new
  &#39;servicefp&#39; attribute to the &#39;service&#39; tag.  Thanks to Brandon Enright
  (bmenrigh(a)ucsd.edu) for sending the patch.
</li><li>  Improved the Windows build system -- mswin32/Makefile now takes care
  of packaging Nmap and creating the installers once Visual Studio (GUI)
  is done building the Release version of mswin32/nmap.sln.  If someone
  knows how to do this (build) step on the command line (using the
  Makefile), please let me know.  Or if you know how to at least make
  &#39;Release&#39; (rather than Debug) the default configuration, that would be
  valuable.
</li><li>  WinPcap 3.1 binaries are now shipped in the Nmap tarball, along with
  a customized installer written by Doug Hoyte.  That new WinPcap
  installer is now used by the Nmap self-installer (if you request
  WinPcap installation).  Some Nmap users were uncomfortable with a
  &quot;phone home&quot; feature of the official WinPcap installer.  It connects
  back to CACE Technologies, ostensibly to display news and (more
  recently) advertisements.  Our new installer omits that feature, but
  should be otherwise perfectly compatible with WinPcap 3.1.
</li><li>  Fixed (I hope) a problem where aggressive --min-parallelization
  option values could cause Nmap to quit with the message &quot;box(300, 100,
  15) called (min,max,num)&quot;.  Thanks to Richard van den Berg
  (richard.vandenberg(a)ins.com) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed a rare crash bug thanks to a report and patch from Ganga
  Bhavani (GBhavani(a)everdreamcorp.com)
</li><li>  Increased a write buffer length to keep Nmap from quitting with the
  message &quot;log_vwrite: write buffer not large enough -- need to
  increase&quot;.  Thanks to Dave (dmarcher(a)pobox.com) for reporting the
  issue.

<li>  Updated to a newer XSL stylesheet (for XML to HTML output
  transformation) by Benjamin Erb.  This new version includes IP
  address sorting, removal of javascript requirements, some new
  address, hostname, and Nmap version information, and various minor
  tweaks and fixes.
</li><li>  Cleaned up the Amiga port code to use atexit() rather than the
  previous macro hack.  Thanks to Kris Katterjohn (katterjohn(a)gmail.com)
  for the patch.  Applied maybe half a dozen new other code cleanup
  patches from him as well.
</li><li>  Made some changes to various Nmap initialization functions which
  help ALT Linux (altlinux.org) and Owl (openwall.com) developers run
  Nmap in a chroot environment.  Thanks to Dmitry V. Levin
  (ldv(a)altlinux.org) for the patch.
</li><li>  Cleaned up the code a bit by making a bunch (nearly 100) global
  symbols (mostly function calls) static.  I was also able to removed
  some unused functions and superfluous config.h.in defines.  Thanks
  to Dmitry V. Levin (ldv(a)altlinux.org) for sending a list of
  candidate symbols.
</li><li>  Nmap now tests for the existence of data files using stat(2) rather
  than testing whether they can be opened for reading (with fopen).
  This is because some device files (tape drives, etc.) may react badly
  to being opened at all.  Thanks to Dmitry V. Levin
  (ldv(a)altlinux.org) for the suggestion.
</li><li>  Changed Nmap to cache interface information rather than opening and
  closing it (with dnet&#39;s eth_open and eth_close functions) all the
  time.
</li><li>  Applied a one-character Visual Studio 2005 compatibility patch from
  kx (kxmail(a)gmail.com).  It changed getch() into _getch() on Windows.

<li>  Added the --log-errors option, which causes most warnings and error
  messages that are printed to interactive-mode output (stdout/stderr)
  to also be printed to the normal-format output file (if you
  specified one).  This will not work for most errors related to bad
  command-line arguments, as Nmap may not have initialized its output
  files yet.  In addition, some Nmap error/warning messages use a
  different system that does not yet support this option.
</li><li>  Rewrote much of the Nmap results output functions to be more
  efficient and support --log-errors.
</li><li>  Fixed a flaw in the scan engine which could (in rare cases)
  lead to a deadlock situation that prevents a scan from completing.
  Thanks to Ganga Bhavani (GBhavani(a)everdreamcorp.com) for reporting
  and helping to debug the problem.
</li><li>  If the pcap_open_live() call (initiates sniffing) fails, Nmap now
  tries up to two more times after waiting a little while. This is
  attempt to work around a rare bug on Windows in which the
  pcap_open_live() fails for unknown reasons.
</li><li>  Fixed a flaw in the runtime interaction in which Nmap would include
  hosts currently being scanned in the number of hosts &quot;completed&quot;
  statistic.
</li><li>  Fixed a crash in OS scan which could occur on Windows when a DHCP
  lease issue causes the system to lose its IP address.  Nmap still
  quits, but at least it gives a proper error message now.  Thanks to
  Ganga Bhavani (GBhavani(a)everdreamcorp.com) for the patch.
</li><li>  Applied more than half a dozen small code cleanup patches from
  Kris Katterjohn (katterjohn(a)gmail.com).
</li><li>  Modified the configure script to accept CXX when specified as an
  absolute path rather than just the executable name.  Thanks to
  Daniel Roethlisberger (daniel(a)roe.ch) for this patch.

  and Andrew Lutomirsky for helping to debug and patch the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed an important memory leak in the raw ethernet sending system.
  Thanks to Ganga Bhavani (GBhavani(a)everdreamcorp.com) for
  identifying the bug and sending a patch.
</li><li>  Fixed --system-dns option so that --system_dns works too.  Error
  messages were changed to reflect the former (preferred) name.
  Thanks to Sean Swift (sean.swift(a)bradford.gov.uk) and Peter
  VanEeckhoutte (Peter.VanEeckhoutte(a)saraleefoodseurope.com) for
  reporting the problem.

  unsigned int, bool, const char*, int): Assertion `row &lt; numRows&#39;
  failed.&quot;  Thanks to Jake Schneider (Jake.Schneider(a)dynetics.com) for
  reporting and helping to debug the problem.
</li><li>  Whenever Nmap sends packets with the SYN bit set (except for OS
  detection), it now includes the maximum segment size (MSS) tcp
  option with a value of 1460.  This makes it stand out less as almost
  all hosts set at least this option.  Thanks to Juergen Schmidt
  (ju(a)heisec.de) for the suggestion.
</li><li>  Applied a patch for a Windows interface reading bug in the aDNS
  subsystem from Doug Hoyte.
</li><li>  Minor changes to recognize DragonFly BSD in configure

<li>  Added runtime interaction support to Windows, thanks to patches from

<li>  Integrated all remaining 2005 service submissions.  The DB now has
  surpassed 3,000 signatures for the first time.  There now are 3,153
  signatures for 381 service protocols.  Those protocols span the
  gamut from abc, acap, afp, and afs to zebedee, zebra, and
  zenimaging.  It even covers obscure protocols such as http, ftp,
  smtp, and ssh :).  Thanks to Version Detection Czar Doug Hoyte for
  his excellent work on this.
</li><li>  Created a Windows executable installer using the open source NSIS
  (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System).  It handles Pcap installation,
  registry performance changes, and adding Nmap to your cmd.exe
  executable path.  The installer source files are in mswin32/nsis/ .
  Thanks to Google SoC student Bo Jiang (jiangbo(a)brandeis.edu) for
  creating the initial version.
</li><li>  Fixed a backward compatibility bug in which Nmap didn&#39;t recognize
  the --min_rtt_timeout option (it only recognized the newly
  hyphenated --min-rtt-timeout).  Thanks to Joshua D. Abraham
  (jabra(a)ccs.neu.edu) for the bug report.
</li><li>  Fixed compilation to again work with gcc-derivatives such as
  MingW. Thanks to Gisle Vanem (giva(a)bgnett.no) for sending the

<li>  Added run time interaction as documented at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-runtime-interaction.html">https://nmap.org/book/man-runtime-interaction.html</a> .
  While Nmap is running, you can now press &#39;v&#39; to increase verbosity,
  &#39;d&#39; to increase the debugging level, &#39;p&#39; to enable packet tracing,
  or the capital versions (V,D,P) to do the opposite.  Any other key
  (such as enter) will print out a status message giving the estimated
  time until scan completion.  This only works on UNIX for now.  Do we
  have any volunteers to add Windows support?  You would need to
  change a handful of UNIX-specific termio calls with the Windows
  equivalents.  This feature was created by Paul Tarjan
  (ptarjan(a)stanford.edu) as part of the Google Summer of Code.
</li><li>  Reverse DNS resolution is now done in parallel rather than one at a
  time.  All scans of large networks (particularly list, ping and
  just-a-few-ports scans) should benefit substantially from this
  change.  If you encounter any problems, please let us know.  The new
  --system_dns option was added so you can use the (slow) system
  resolver if you prefer that for some reason.  You can specify a
  comma separated list of DNS server IP addresses for Nmap to use with
  the new --dns_servers option.  Otherwise, Nmap looks in
  /etc/resolve.conf (UNIX) or the system registry (Windows) to obtain
  the nameservers already configured for your system.  This excellent
  patch was written by Doug Hoyte (doug(a)hcsw.org).
</li><li>  Added the --badsum option, which causes Nmap to use invalid TCP or
  UDP checksums for packets sent to target hosts. Since virtually all
  host IP stacks properly drop these packets, any responses received
  are likely coming from a firewall or IDS that didn&#39;t bother to
  verify the checksum. For more details on this technique, see
  <a href="http://www.phrack.org/phrack/60/p60-0x0c.txt">http://www.phrack.org/phrack/60/p60-0x0c.txt</a> .  The author of that
  paper, Ed3f (ed3f(a)antifork.org), is also the author of this patch
  (which I changed it a bit).
</li><li>  The 26 Nmap commands that previously included an underscore
  (--max_rtt_timeout, --send_eth, --host_timeout, etc.) have been
  renamed to use a hyphen in the preferred format
  (i.e. --max-rtt-timeout).  Underscores are still supported for
  backward compatibility.
</li><li>  More excellent NmapFE patches from Priit Laes (amd(a)store20.com)
  were applied to remove all deprecated GTK API calls.  This also
  eliminates the annoying Gtk-Critical and Gtk-WARNING runtime messages.
</li><li>  Changed the way the __attribute__ compiler extension is detected so
  that it works with the latest Fedora Core 4 updates (and perhaps other
  systems).  Thanks to Duilio Protti (dprotti(a)fceia.unr.edu.ar) for
  writing the patch.  The compilation error message this fixes was
  usually something like: &quot;nmap.o(.rodata+0x17c): undefined reference
  to `__gthrw_pthread_cancel(unsigned long)&quot;
</li><li>  Added some exception handling code to mswin32/winfix.cc to prevent
  Nmap from crashing mysteriously when you have WinPcap 3.0 or earlier
  (instead of the required 3.1).  It now prints an error message instead
  asking you to upgrade, then reduces functionality to connect()-only
  mode.  I couldn&#39;t get it working with the C++ standard try/catch()
  blocks, but as soon as I used the nonstandard MS conventions
  (__try/__except(), everything worked fine. Shrug.
</li><li>  Stripped the firewall API out of the libdnet included with Nmap
  because Nmap doesn&#39;t use it anyway.  This saves space and reduces the
  likelihood of compilation errors and warnings.
</li><li>  Modified the previously useless --noninteractive option so that it
  deactivates runtime interaction.

<li>  Added --max_retries option for capping the maximum number of
  retransmissions the port scan engine will do. The value may be as low
  as 0 (no retransmits).  A low value can increase speed, though at the
  risk of losing accuracy.  The -T4 option now allows up to 6 retries,
  and -T5 allows 2.  Thanks to Martin Macok
  (martin.macok(a)underground.cz) for writing the initial patch, which I
  changed quite a bit.  I also updated the docs to reflect this neat
  new option.
</li><li>  Many of the Nmap low-level timing options take a value in
  milliseconds.  You can now append an &#39;s&#39;, &#39;m&#39;, or &#39;h&#39; to the value
  to give it in seconds, minutes, or hours instead.  So you can specify a
  45 minute host timeout with --host_timeout 45m rather than specifying
  --host_timeout 2700000 and hoping you did the math right and have the
  correct number of zeros.  This also now works for the
  --min_rtt_timeout, --max_rtt_timeout, --initial_rtt_timeout,
  --scan_delay, and --max_scan_delay options.
</li><li>  Improved the NmapFE port to GTK2 so it better-conforms to the new
  API and you don&#39;t get as many annoying messages in your terminal
  window.  GTK2 is prettier and more functional too.  Thanks to Priit
  Laes (amd(a)store20.com) for writing these
  excellent patches.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem which led to the error message &quot;Failed to determine
  dst MAC address for target&quot; when you try to run Nmap using a
  dialup/PPP adapter on Windows rather than a real ethernet card.  Due
  to Microsoft breaking raw sockets, Nmap no longer supports dialup
  adapters, but it should now give you a clearer error message than
  the &quot;dst MAC address&quot; nonsense.
</li><li>  Debian GNU/kFreeBSD is now supported thanks to a patch to libdnet&#39;s
  configure.in by Petr Salinger (Petr.Salinger(a)t-systems.cz).
</li><li>  Tried to update to the latest autoconf only to find that there
  hasn&#39;t been a new version in more than two years :(.  I was able to
  find new config.sub and config.guess files at
  <a href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/config/config">http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/config/config</a>/ , so I updated to
  those.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem with the -e option when run on Windows (or UNIX with
  --send_eth) when run on an ethernet network against an external
  (routed) host.  You would get the message &quot;NmapArpCache() can only
  take IPv4 addresses.  Sorry&quot;.  Thanks to KX (kxmail(a)gmail.com) for
  helping to track down the problem.
</li><li>  Made some changes to allow source port zero scans (-g0).  Nmap used
  to refuse to do this, but now it just gives a warning that it may not
  work on all systems.  It seems to work fine on my Linux box.  Thanks
  to Bill Dale (bill_dale(a)bellsouth.net) for suggesting this feature.
</li><li>  Made a change to libdnet so that Windows interfaces are listed as
  down if they are disconnected, unplugged, or otherwise unavailable.
</li><li>  Ceased including foreign translations in the Nmap tarball as they
  take up too much space.  HTML versions can be found at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/docs.html">https://nmap.org/docs.html</a> , while XML and NROFF versions
  are available from <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/man-xlate">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/man-xlate</a>/ .
</li><li>  Changed INSTALL and README-WIN32 files to mostly just reference the
  new Nmap Install Guide at <a href="https://nmap.org/book/install.html">https://nmap.org/book/install.html</a> .
</li><li>  Included docs/nmap-man.xml in the tarball distribution, which is the
  DocBook XML source for the Nmap man page.  Patches to Nmap that are
  user-visible should include patches to the man page XML source rather
  than to the generated Nroff.
</li><li>  Fixed Nmap so it doesn&#39;t crash when you ask it to resume a previous
  scan, but pass in a bogus file rather than actual Nmap output.  Thanks
  to Piotr Sobolewski (piotr_sobolewski(a)o2.pl) for the fix.

  from working from a non-privileged user account.  The -PT option
  doesn&#39;t change default behavior in this case, but Nmap should (and now
  does) allow it.
</li><li>  Applied another VS 2005 compatibility patch from KX (kxmail(a)gmail.com).
</li><li>  Define INET_ADDRSTRLEN in tcpip.h if the system doesn&#39;t define it
  for us.  This apparently aids compilation on Solaris 2.6 and 7.
  Thanks to Albert Chin (nmap-hackers(a)mlists.thewrittenword.com) for
  sending the patch..

<li>  Put Nmap on a diet, with changes to the core port scanning routine
  (ultra_scan) to substantially reduce memory consumption, particularly
  when tens of thousands of ports are scanned.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem with the -S and option on Windows reporting &quot;Failed
  to resolve/decode supposed IPv4 source address&quot;.  The -D (decoy)
  option was probably broken on that platform too.  Thanks to KX
  (kxmail(a)gmail.com) for reporting the problem and tracking down a
  potential solution.
</li><li>  Better handle ICMP type 3, code 0 (network unreachable) responses to
  port scan packets.  These are rarely seen when scanning hosts that
  are actually online, but are still worth handling.
</li><li>  Applied some small fixes so that Nmap compiles with Visual C++
  2005 Express, which is free from Microsoft at
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc</a>/ .  Thanks to KX
  (kxmail(a)gmail.com) and Sina Bahram (sbahram(a)nc.rr.com)
</li><li>  Removed foreign translations of the old man page from the
  distribution.  Included the following contributed translations
  (nroff format) of the new man page:
<ul><li>Brazilian Portuguese by Lucien Raven (lucienraven(a)yahoo.com.br)
</li><li>Portuguese (Portugal) by Jos&eacute; Domingos (jd_pt(a)yahoo.com) and
    Andreia Gaita (shana.ufie(a)gmail.com).</li></ul>

</li><li>  Added --thc option (undocumented)
</li><li>  Modified libdnet-stripped/src/eth-bsd.c to allow for up to 128 bpf
  devices rather than 32.  This prevents errors like &quot;Failed to open
  ethernet interface (fxp0)&quot; when there are more than 32 interface
  aliases.  Thanks to Krok (krok(a)void.ru) for reporting the problem
  and even sending a patch.

<li>  Wrote a new man page from scratch.  It is much more comprehensive
  (more than twice as long) and (IMHO) better organized than the
  previous one.  Read it online at <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man.html">https://nmap.org/book/man.html</a>
  or docs/nmap.1 from the Nmap distribution.  Let me know if you have
  any ideas for improving it.
</li><li>  Wrote a new &quot;help screen&quot;, which you get when running Nmap without
  arguments.  It is also reproduced in the man page and at
  <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.usage.txt">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.usage.txt</a> .  I gave up trying
  to fit it within a 25-line, 80-column terminal window.  It is now 78
  lines and summarizes all but the most obscure Nmap options.
</li><li>  Version detection softmatches (when Nmap determines the service
  protocol such as smtp but isn&#39;t able to determine the app name such as
  Postfix) can now parse out the normal match line fields such as
  hostname, device type, and extra info.  For example, we may not know
  what vendor created an sshd, but we can still parse out the protocol
  number.  This was a patch from Doug Hoyte (doug(a)hcsw.org).
</li><li>  Fixed a problem which caused UDP version scanning to fail to print
  the matched service.  Thanks to Martin Macok
  (martin.macok(a)underground.cz) for reporting the problem and Doug
  Hoyte (doug(a)hcsw.org) for fixing it.
</li><li>  Made the version detection &quot;ports&quot; directive (in
  nmap-service-probes) more comprehensive.  This should speed up scans a
  bit.  The patch was done by Doug Hoyte (doug(a)hcsw.org).
</li><li>  Added the --webxml option, which does the same thing as
  --stylesheet <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.xsl">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.xsl</a> , without
  requiring you to remember the exact URL or type that whole thing.
</li><li>  Fixed a crash occurred when the --exclude option was used with
  netmasks on certain platforms.  Thanks to Adam
  (nmapuser(a)globalmegahost.com) for reporting the problem and to
  Greg Darke (starstuff(a)optusnet.com.au) for sending a patch (I
  modified the patch a bit to make it more efficient).
</li><li>  Fixed a problem with the -S and -e options (spoof/set
  source address, and set interface by name, respectively).  The problem
  report and a partial patch were sent by Richard Birkett
  (richard(a)musicbox.net).
</li><li>  Fixed a possible aliasing problem in tcpip.cc by applying a patch sent in by
  Gwenole Beauchesne (gbeauchesne(a)mandriva.com).  This problem
  shouldn&#39;t have had any effect on users since we already include the
  -fno-strict-aliasing option whenever gcc 4 is detected, but it
  brings us closer to being able to remove that option.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that caused Nmap to crash if an nmap-service-probes file
  was used which didn&#39;t contain the Exclude directive.
</li><li>  Fixed a bunch of typos and misspellings throughout the Nmap source
  code (mostly in comments).  This was a 625-line patch by Saint Xavier
  (skyxav(a)skynet.be).
</li><li>  Nmap now accepts target list files in Windows end-of-line format (\r\n)
  as well as standard UNIX format (\n) on all platforms.  Passing a
  Windows style file to Nmap on UNIX didn&#39;t work before unless you ran
  dos2unix first.
</li><li>  Removed Identd scan support from NmapFE since Nmap no longer
  supports it.  Thanks to Jonathan Dieter (jdieter99(a)gmx.net) for the
  patch.
</li><li>  Integrated all of the September version detection fingerprint
  submissions.  This was done by Version Detection Czar Doug Hoyte
  (doug(a)hcsw.org) and resulted in 86 new match lines.  Please keep
  those submissions coming!
</li><li>  Fixed a divide-by-zero crash when you specify rather bogus
  command-line arguments (a TCP scan with zero tcp ports).  Thanks to
  Bart Dopheide (dopheide(a)fmf.nl) for identifying the problem and
  sending a patch.
</li><li>  Fixed a minor syntax error in tcpip.h that was causing problems with
  GCC 4.1.  Thanks to Dirk Mueller (dmuell(a)gmx.net) for reporting
  the problem and sending a fix.

<li>  Modified Libpcap&#39;s configure.ac to compile with the
  -fno-strict-aliasing option if gcc 4.X is used.  This prevents
  crashes when said compiler is used.  This was done for Nmap in 3.90, but is
  apparently needed for pcap too.  Thanks to Craig Humphrey
  (Craig.Humphrey(a)chapmantripp.com) for the discovery.
</li><li>  Patched libdnet to include sys/uio.h in src/tun-linux.c.  This is
  apparently necessary on some Glibc 2.1 systems.  Thanks to Rob Foehl
  (rwf(a)loonybin.net) for the patch.
</li><li>  Fixed a crash which could occur when a ridiculously short
  --host_timeout was specified on Windows (or on UNIX if --send_eth was
  specified).  Nmap now also prints a warning if you specify a
  host_timeout of less than 1 second.  Thanks to Ole Morten Grodaas
  (grodaas(a)gmail.com) for discovering the problem.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 3.91 [2005-9-11] <a class="versionlink" id="3.91" href="#3.91" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Fixed a crash on Windows when you -P0 scan an unused IP on a local
  network (or a range that contains unused IPs).  This could also
  happen on UNIX if you specified the new --send_eth option.  Thanks
  to Jim Carras (JFCECL(a)engr.psu.edu) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed compilation on OpenBSD by applying a patch from Okan Demirmen
  (okan(a)demirmen.com), who maintains Nmap in the OpenBSD Ports
  collection.
</li><li>  Updated nmap-mac-prefixes to include OUIs assigned by the IEEE since
  April.
</li><li>  Updated the included libpcre (used for version detection) from
  version 4.3 to 6.3.  A libpcre security issue was fixed in 6.3, but
  that issue never affected Nmap.
</li><li>  Updated the included libpcap from 0.8.3 to 0.9.3.  I also changed
  the directory name in the Nmap tarball from libpcap-possiblymodified
  to just libpcap.  As usual, the modifications are described in the
  NMAP_MODIFICATIONS in that directory.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 3.90 [2005-9-8] <a class="versionlink" id="3.90" href="#3.90" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Added the ability for Nmap to send and properly route raw ethernet
  packets containing IP datagrams rather than always sending the
  packets via raw sockets. This is particularly useful for Windows,
  since Microsoft has disabled raw socket support in XP for no good
  reason.  Nmap tries to choose the best method at runtime based on
  platform, though you can override it with the new --send_eth and
  --send_ip options.
</li><li>  Added ARP scanning (-PR). Nmap can now send raw ethernet ARP requests to
  determine whether hosts on a LAN are up, rather than relying on
  higher-level IP packets (which can only be sent after a successful
  ARP request and reply anyway).  This is much faster and more
  reliable (not subject to IP-level firewalling) than IP-based probes.
  The downside is that it only works when the target machine is on the
  same LAN as the scanning machine.  It is now used automatically for
  any hosts that are detected to be on a local ethernet network,
  unless --send_ip was specified.  Example usage: nmap -sP -PR
  192.168.0.0/16 .
</li><li>  Added the --spoof_mac option, which asks Nmap to use the given MAC
  address for all of the raw ethernet frames it sends.  The MAC given
  can take several formats.  If it is simply the string &quot;0&quot;, Nmap
  chooses a completely random MAC for the session.  If the given
  string is an even number of hex digits (with the pairs optionally
  separated by a colon), Nmap will use those as the MAC.  If less than
  12 hex digits are provided, Nmap fills in the remainder of the 6
  bytes with random values.  If the argument isn&#39;t a 0 or hex string,
  Nmap looks through the nmap-mac-prefixes to find a vendor name
  containing the given string (it is case insensitive).  If a match is
  found, Nmap uses the vendor&#39;s OUI (3-byte prefix) and fills out the
  remaining 3 bytes randomly.  Valid --spoof_mac argument examples are
  &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;01:02:03:04:05:06&quot;, &quot;deadbeefcafe&quot;, &quot;0020F2&quot;, and
  &quot;Cisco&quot;.
</li><li>  Applied an enormous nmap-service-probes (version detection) update
  from SoC student Doug Hoyte (doug(a)hcsw.org).  Version 3.81 had
  1064 match lines covering 195 service protocols.  Now we have 2865
  match lines covering 359 protocols!  So the database size has nearly
  tripled!  This should make your -sV scans quicker and more
  accurate.  Thanks also go to the (literally) thousands of you who
  submitted service fingerprints.  Keep them coming!
</li><li>  Applied a massive OS fingerprint update from Zhao Lei
  (zhaolei(a)gmail.com).  About 350 fingerprints were added, and many
  more were updated.  Notable additions include Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger),
  OpenBSD 3.7, FreeBSD 5.4, Windows Server 2003 SP1, Sony AIBO (along
  with a new &quot;robotic pet&quot; device type category), the latest Linux 2.6
  kernels Cisco routers with IOS 12.4, a ton of VoIP devices, Tru64
  UNIX 5.1B, new Fortinet firewalls, AIX 5.3, NetBSD 2.0, Nokia IPSO
  3.8.X, and Solaris 10.  Of course there are also tons of new
  broadband routers, printers, WAPs and pretty much any other device
  you can coax an ethernet cable (or wireless card) into!
</li><li>  Added &#39;leet ASCII art to the configurator!  ARTIST NOTE: If you think
  the ASCII art sucks, feel free to send me alternatives.  Note that
  only people compiling the UNIX source code get this (ASCII artist
  unknown).
</li><li>  Added OS, device type, and hostname detection using the service
  detection framework.  Many services print a hostname, which may be
  different than DNS.  The services often give more away as well.  If
  Nmap detects IIS, it reports an OS family of &quot;Windows&quot;.  If it sees
  HP JetDirect telnetd, it reports a device type of &quot;printer&quot;.  Rather
  than try to combine TCP/IP stack fingerprinting and service OS
  fingerprinting, they are both printed.  After all, they could
  legitimately be different.  An IP that gives a stack fingerprint
  match of &quot;Linksys WRT54G broadband router&quot; and a service fingerprint
  of Windows based on Kazaa running is likely a common NAT setup rather
  than an Nmap mistake.
</li><li>  Nmap on Windows now compiles/links with the new WinPcap 3.1
  header/lib files. So please upgrade to 3.1 from
  <a href="http://www.winpcap.org">http://www.winpcap.org</a> before installing this version of Nmap.
  While older versions may still work, they aren&#39;t supported with Nmap.
</li><li>  The official Nmap RPM files are now compiled statically for better
  compatibility with other systems.  X86_64 (AMD Athlon64/Opteron)
  binaries are now available in addition to the standard i386.  NmapFE
  RPMs are no longer distributed by Insecure.Org.
</li><li>  Nmap distribution signing has changed. Release files are now signed
  with a new Nmap Project GPG key (KeyID 6B9355D0).  Fyodor has also
  generated a new key for himself (KeyID 33599B5F).  The Nmap key has
  been signed by Fyodor&#39;s new key, which has been signed by Fyodor&#39;s
  old key so that you know they are legit.  The new keys are available
  at <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap_gpgkeys.txt">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap_gpgkeys.txt</a> , as
  docs/nmap_gpgkeys.txt in the Nmap source tarball, and on the public
  keyserver network.  Here are the fingerprints:
<pre>
    pub  1024D/33599B5F 2005-04-24
         Key fingerprint = BB61 D057 C0D7 DCEF E730  996C 1AF6 EC50 3359 9B5F

    sub  2048g/A50A6A94 2005-04-24</pre>
</li><li>  Fixed a crash problem related to non-portable varargs (vsnprintf)
  usage. Reports of this crash came from Alan William Somers
  (somers(a)its.caltech.edu) and Christophe (chris.branch(a)gmx.de).
  This patch was prevalent on Linux boxes running an Opteron/Athlon64
  CPU in 64-bit mode.
</li><li>  Fixed crash when Nmap is compiled using gcc 4.X by adding the
  -fno-strict-aliasing option when that compiler is detected.  Thanks
  to Greg Darke (starstuff(a)optusnet.com.au) for discovering that
  this option fixes (hides) the problem and to Duilio J. Protti
  (dprotti(a)flowgate.net) for writing the configure patch to detect
  gcc 4 and add the option.  A better fix is to identify and rewrite
  lines that violate C99 alias rules, and we are looking into that.
</li><li>  Added &quot;rarity&quot; feature to Nmap version detection.  This causes
  obscure probes to be skipped when they are unlikely to help.  Each
  probe now has a &quot;rarity&quot; value.  Probes that detect dozens of
  services such as GenericLines and GetRequest have rarity values of
  1, while the WWWOFFLEctrlstat and mydoom probes have a rarity of 9.
  When interrogating a port, Nmap always tries probes registered to
  that port number.  So even WWWOFFLEctrlstat will be tried against
  port 8081 and mydoom will be tried against open ports between 3127
  and 3198.  If none of the registered ports find a match, Nmap tries
  probes that have a rarity less than or equal to its current
  intensity level.  The intensity level defaults to 7 (so that most of
  the probes are done).  You can set the intensity level with the new
  --version_intensity option.  Alternatively, you can just use
  --version_light or --version_all which set the intensity to 2 (only
  try the most important probes and ones registered to the port
  number) and 9 (try all probes), respectively.  --version_light is
  much faster than default version detection, but also a bit less
  likely to find a match.  This feature was designed and implemented
  by Doug Hoyte (doug(a)hcsw.org).
</li><li>  Added a &quot;fallback&quot; feature to the nmap-service-probes database.
  This allows a probe to &quot;inherit&quot; match lines from other probes.  It
  is currently only used for the HTTPOptions, RTSPRequest, and
  SSLSessionReq probes to inherit all of the match lines from
  GetRequest.  Some servers don&#39;t respond to the Nmap GetRequest (for
  example because it doesn&#39;t include a Host: line) but they do respond
  to some of those other 3 probes in ways that GetRequest match lines
  are general enough to match.  The fallback construct allows us to
  benefit from these matches without repeating hundreds of signatures
  in the file.  This is another feature designed and implemented
  by Doug Hoyte (doug(a)hcsw.org).
</li><li>  Fixed crash with certain --excludefile or
  --exclude arguments.  Thanks to Kurt Grutzmacher
  (grutz(a)jingojango.net) and pijn trein (ptrein(a)gmail.com) for
  reporting the problem, and to Duilio J. Protti
  (dprotti(a)flowgate.net) for debugging the issue and sending the
  patch.
</li><li>  Updated random scan (ip_is_reserved()) to reflect the latest IANA
  assignments.  This patch was sent in by Felix Groebert
  (felix(a)groebert.org).
</li><li>  Included new Russian man page translation by
  locco_bozi(a)Safe-mail.net
</li><li>  Applied patch from Steve Martin (smartin(a)stillsecure.com) which
  standardizes many OS names and corrects typos in nmap-os-fingerprints.
</li><li>  Fixed a crash found during certain UDP version scans.  The crash was
  discovered and reported by Ron (iago(a)valhallalegends.com) and fixed
  by Doug Hoyte (doug(a)hcsw.com).
</li><li>  Added --iflist argument which prints a list of system interfaces and
  routes detected by Nmap.
</li><li>  Fixed a protocol scan (-sO) problem which led to the error message:
  &quot;Error compiling our pcap filter: syntax error&quot;.  Thanks to Michel
  Arboi (michel(a)arboi.fr.eu.org) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed an Nmap version detection crash on Windows which led to the
  error message &quot;Unexpected error in NSE_TYPE_READ callback.  Error
  code: 10053 (Unknown error)&quot;.  Thanks to Srivatsan
  (srivatsanp(a)adventnet.com) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed some misspellings in docs/nmap.xml reported by Tom Sellers.
</li><li>  Applied some changes from Gisle Vanem (giva(a)bgnett.no) to make
  Nmap compile with Cygwin.
</li><li>  XML &quot;osmatch&quot; element now has a &quot;line&quot; attribute giving the
  reference fingerprint line number in nmap-os-fingerprints.
</li><li>  Added a distcc probes and a bunch of smtp matches from Dirk Mueller
  (mueller(a)kde.org) to nmap-service-probes.  Also added AFS version
  probe and matches from Lionel Cons (lionel.cons(a)cern.ch).  And
  even more probes and matches from Martin Macok
  (martin.macok(a)underground.cz)
</li><li>  Fixed a problem where Nmap compilation would use header files from
  the libpcap included with Nmap even when it was linking to a system
  libpcap.  Thanks to Solar Designer (solar(a)openwall.com) and Okan
  Demirmen (okan(a)demirmen.com) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Added configure option --with-libpcap=included to tell Nmap to use
  the version of libpcap it ships with rather than any that may already be
  installed on the system.  You can still use --with-libpcap=[dir] to
  specify that a system libpcap be installed rather than the shipped
  one.  By default, Nmap looks at both and decides which one is likely
  to work best.  If you are having problems on Solaris, try
  --with-libpcap=included .
</li><li>  Changed the --no-stylesheet option to --no_stylesheet to be
  consistent with all of the other Nmap options.  Though I&#39;m starting to
  like hyphens a bit better than underscores and may change all of the
  options to use hyphens instead at some point.
</li><li>  Added &quot;Exclude&quot; directive to nmap-service-probes grammar which
  causes version detection to skip listed ports.  This is helpful for
  ports such as 9100.  Some printers simply print any data sent to
  that port, leading to pages of HTTP requests, SMB queries, X Windows
  probes, etc.  If you really want to scan all ports, specify
  --allports.  This patch came from Doug Hoyte (doug(a)hcsw.org).
</li><li>  Added a stripped-down and heavily modified version of Dug Song&#39;s
  libdnet networking library (v. 1.10).  This helps with the new raw
  ethernet features.  My (extensive) changes are described in
  libdnet-stripped/NMAP_MODIFICATIONS
</li><li>  Removed WinIP library (and all Windows raw sockets code) since MS
  has gone and broken raw sockets.  Maybe packet receipt via raw
  sockets will come back at some point.  As part of this removal, the
  Windows-specific --win_help, --win_list_interfaces, --win_norawsock,
  --win_forcerawsock, --win_nopcap, --win_nt4route, --win_noiphlpapi,
  and --win_trace options have been removed.
</li><li>  Changed the interesting ports array from a 65K-member array of
  pointers into an STL list.  This noticeable reduces memory usage in
  some cases, and should also give a slight runtime performance
  boost. This patch was written by Paul Tarjan (ptarjan(a)gmail.com).
</li><li>  Removed the BSDFIX/BSDUFIX macros.  The underlying bug in
  FreeBSD/NetBSD is still there though.  When an IP packet is sent
  through a raw socket, these platforms require the total length and
  fragmentation offset fields of an IP packet to be in host byte order
  rather than network byte order, even though all the other fields
  must be in NBO.  I believe that OpenBSD fixed this a while back.
  Other platforms, such as Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows take
  all of the fields in network byte order.  While I removed the macro,
  I still do the munging where required so that Nmap still works on
  FreeBSD.
</li><li>  Integrated many nmap-service-probes changes from Bo Jiang
  (jiangbo(a)brandeis.edu)
</li><li>  Added a bunch of RPC numbers from nmap-rpc maintainer Eilon Gishri
  (eilon(a)aristo.tau.ac.il)
</li><li>  Added some new RPC services to nmap-rpc thanks to a patch from
  vlad902 (vlad902(a)gmail.com).
</li><li>  Fixed a bug where Nmap would quit on Windows whenever it encountered
  a raw scan of localhost (including the local ethernet interface
  address), even when that was just one address out of a whole network
  being scanned.  Now Nmap just warns that it is skipping raw scans when
  it encounters the local IP, but continues on to scan the rest of the
  network.  Raw scans do not currently work against local IP addresses
  because WinPcap doesn&#39;t support reading/writing localhost interfaces
  due to limitations of Windows.
</li><li>  The OS fingerprint is now provided in XML output if debugging is
  enabled (-d) or verbosity is at least 2 (-v -v).  This patch was
  sent by Okan Demirmen (okan(a)demirmen.com)
</li><li>  Fixed the way tcp connect scan (-sT) response to ICMP network
  unreachable responses (patch by Richard Moore
  (rich(a)westpoint.ltd.uk).
</li><li>  Update random host scan (-iR) to support the latest IANA-allocated
  ranges, thanks to patch by Chad Loder (cloder(a)loder.us).
</li><li>  Updated GNU shtool (a helper program used during &#39;make install&#39; to
  version 2.0.2, which fixes a predictable temporary filename
  weakness discovered by Eric Raymond.
</li><li>  Removed addport element from XML DTD, since it is no longer used
  (suggested by Lionel Cons (lionel.cons(a)cern.ch)
</li><li>  Added new --privileged command-line option and NMAP_PRIVILEGED
  environmental variable.  Either of these tell Nmap to assume that
  the user has full privileges to execute raw packet scans, OS
  detection and the like.  This can be useful when Linux kernel
  capabilities or other systems are used that allow non-root users to
  perform raw packet or ethernet frame manipulation.  Without this
  flag or variable set, Nmap bails on UNIX if geteuid() is
  nonzero.
</li><li>  Changed the RPM spec file so that if you define &quot;static&quot; to 1 (by
  passing --define &quot;static 1&quot; to rpmbuild), static binaries are built.
</li><li>  Fixed Nmap compilation on Solaris x86 thanks to a patch from Simon
  Burr (simes(a)bpfh.net).
</li><li>  ultra_scan() now sets pseudo-random ACK values (rather than 0) for
  any TCP scans in which the initial probe packet has the ACK flag set.
  This would be the ACK, Xmas, Maimon, and Window scans.
</li><li>  Updated the Nmap version number, description, and similar fields
  that MS Visual Studio places in the binary.  This was done by editing
  mswin32/nmap.rc as suggested by Chris Paget (chrisp(a)ngssoftware.com)
</li><li>  Fixed Nmap compilation on DragonFly BSD (and perhaps some other
  systems) by applying a short patch by Joerg Sonnenberger which omits
  the declaration of errno if it is a #define.
</li><li>  Fixed an integer overflow that prevented Nmap from scanning
  2,147,483,648 hosts in one expression (e.g. 0.0.0.0/1).  Problem
  noted by Justin Cranford (jcranford(a)n-able.com).  While /1 scans
  are now possible, don&#39;t expect them to finish during your bathroom
  break.  No matter how constipated you are.
</li><li>  Increased the buffer size allocated for fingerprints to prevent Nmap
  from running out and quitting (error message: &quot;Assertion
  `servicefpalloc - servicefplen &gt; 8&#39; failed&quot;.  Thanks to Mike Hatz
  (mhatz(a)blackcat.com) for the report. (Actually this was done in a
  previous version, but I forgot which one.)
</li><li>  Changed from CVS to Subversion source control system (which
  rocks!). Neither repository is public (I&#39;m paranoid because both CVS
  and SVN have had remotely exploitable security holes), so the main
  change users will see is that &quot;Id&quot; tags in file headers use the SVN
  format for version numbering and such.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 3.81 [2005-2-7] <a class="versionlink" id="3.81" href="#3.81" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Nmap now ships with and installs (in the same directory as other
  data files such as nmap-os-fingerprints) an XSL stylesheet for
  rendering the XML output as HTML.  This stylesheet was written by
  Benjamin Erb ( see <a href="http://www.benjamin-erb.de/nmap">http://www.benjamin-erb.de/nmap</a>/ for examples).
  It supports tables, version detection, color-coded port states, and
  more.  The XML output has been augmented to include an
  xml-stylesheet directive pointing to nmap.xsl on the local
  file system.  You can point to a different XSL file by providing the
  filename or URL to the new --stylesheet argument.  Omit the
  xml-stylesheet directive entirely by specifying --no-stylesheet.
  The XML to HTML conversion can be done with an XSLT processor such
  as Saxon, Sablot, or Xalan, but modern browsers can do this on the
  fly -- simply load the XML output file in IE or Firefox.  Some
  features don&#39;t currently work with Firefox&#39;s on-the-fly rendering.
  Perhaps some Mozilla wizard can fix that in either the XSL or the
  browser itself.  I hate having things work better in IE :).  It is
  often more convenient to have the stylesheet loaded from a URL
  rather than the local file system, allowing the XML to be rendered on
  any machine regardless of whether/where the XSL is installed.  For
  privacy reasons (avoid loading of an external URL when you view
  results), Nmap uses the local file system by default.  If you would
  like the latest version of the stylesheet loaded from the web when
  rendering, specify --stylesheet <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.xsl">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.xsl</a> .
</li><li>  Fixed fragmentation option (-f).  One -f now sets sends fragments
  with just 8 bytes after the IP header, while -ff sends 16 bytes to
  reduce the number of fragments needed.  You can specify your own
  fragmentation offset (must be a multiple of 8) with the new --mtu
  flag.  Don&#39;t also specify -f if you use --mtu.  Remember that some
  systems (such as Linux with connection tracking) will defragment in
  the kernel anyway -- so test first while sniffing with ethereal.
  These changes are from a patch by Martin Macok
  (martin.macok(a)underground.cz).
</li><li>  Nmap now prints the number (and total bytes) of raw IP packets sent
  and received when it completes, if verbose mode (-v) is enabled.  The
  report looks like:
<pre>
   Nmap finished: 256 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 30.632 seconds
                  Raw packets sent: 7727 (303KB) | Rcvd: 6944 (304KB)</pre>
</li><li>  Fixed (I hope) an error which would cause the Windows version of
  Nmap to abort under some circumstances with the error message
  &quot;Unexpected error in NSE_TYPE_READ callback.  Error code: 10053
  (Unknown error)&quot;.  Problem reported by &quot;Tony Golding&quot;
  (biz(a)tonygolding.com).
</li><li>  Added new &quot;closed|filtered&quot; state.  This is used for Idle scan, since
  that scan method can&#39;t distinguish between those two states.  Nmap
  previously just used &quot;closed&quot;, but this is more accurate.
</li><li>  Null, FIN, Maimon, and Xmas scans now mark ports as &quot;open|filtered&quot;
  instead of &quot;open&quot; when they fail to receive any response from the
  target port.  After all, it could just as easily be filtered as open.
  This is the same change that was made to UDP scan in 3.70.  Also as
  with UDP scan, adding version detection (-sV) will change the state
  from open|filtered to open if it confirms that they really are open.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in ACK scan that could cause Nmap to crash with the
  message &quot;Unexpected port state: 6&quot; in some cases.  Thanks to Glyn
  Geoghegan (glyng(a)corsaire.com) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Change IP protocol scan (-sO) so that a response from the target
  host in any protocol at all will prove that protocol is open.  As
  before, no response means &quot;open|filtered&quot;, an ICMP protocol
  unreachable means &quot;closed&quot;, and most other ICMP error messages mean
  &quot;filtered&quot;.
</li><li>  Patched a libpcap issue that prevented read timeouts from being
  honored on Solaris (thus slowing down Nmap substantially).  The
  problem report and patch were sent in by Ben Harris
  (bjh21(a)cam.ac.uk).
</li><li>  Changed IP protocol scan (-sO) so that it sends valid ICMP, TCP, and
  UDP headers when scanning protocols 1, 6, and 17, respectively.  An
  empty IP header is still sent for all other protocols.  This should
  prevent the error messages such as &quot;sendto in send_ip_packet:
  sendto(3, packet, 20, 0, 192.31.33.7, 16) =&gt; Operation not
  permitted&quot; that Linux (and perhaps other systems) would give when
  they try to interpret the raw packet.  This also makes it more
  likely that these protocols will elicit a response, proving that the
  protocol is &quot;open&quot;.
</li><li>  The windows build now uses header and static library files from
  WinPcap 3.1Beta4.  It also now prints out the DLL version you are
  using when run with -d.  I would recommend upgrading to 3.1Beta4 if
  you have an older WinPcap installed.
</li><li>  Nmap now prints a warning message on Windows if WinPcap is not found
  (it then reverts to raw sockets mode if available, as usual).
</li><li>  Added an NTP probe and matches to the version detection database
  (nmap-service-probes) thanks to a submission from Martin
  Macok (martin.macok(a)underground.cz).
</li><li>  Applied several Nmap service detection database updates sent in by
  Martin Macok (martin.macok(a)underground.cz).
</li><li>  The XML nmaprun element now has a startstr attribute which gives the
  human readable calendar time format that a scan started.  Similarly
  the finished element now has a timestr attribute describing when the
  scan finished.  These are in addition to the existing nmaprun/start
  and finished/time attributes that provided the start and finish time
  in UNIX time_t notation.  This should help in development of
  XSLT stylesheets for Nmap XML output.
</li><li>  Fixed a memory leak that would generally consume several hundred
  bytes per down host scanned.  While the effect for most scans is
  negligible, it was overwhelming when Scott Carlson
  (Scott.Carlson(a)schwab.com) tried to scan 16.8 million IPs
  (10.0.0.0/8).  Thanks to him for reporting the problem.  Also thanks
  to Valgrind ( <a href="http://valgrind.kde.org">http://valgrind.kde.org</a> ) for making it easy to debug.
</li><li>  Fixed a crash on Windows systems that don&#39;t include the iphlpapi
  DLL.  This affects Win95 and perhaps other variants.  Thanks to Ganga
  Bhavani (GBhavani(a)everdreamcorp.com) for reporting the problem and
  sending the patch.
</li><li>  Ensured that the device type, os vendor, and os family OS
  fingerprinting classification values are scrubbed for XML compliance
  in the XML output.  Thanks to Matthieu Verbert
  (mve(a)zurich.ibm.com) for reporting the problem and sending a patch.
</li><li>  Rewrote the host IP (target specification) parser for easier
  maintenance and to fix a bug found by Netris (netris(a)ok.kz)
</li><li>  Changed to Nmap XML DTD to use the same xmloutputversion (1.01) as
  newer versions of Nmap.  Thanks to Laurent Estieux
  (laurent.estieux(a)free.fr) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed compilation on some HP-UX 11 boxes thanks to a patch by Petter
  Reinholdtsen (pere(a)hungry.com).
</li><li>  Fixed a portability problem on some OpenBSD and FreeBSD machines
  thanks to a patch by Okan Demirmen (okan(a)demirmen.com).
</li><li>  Applied Martin Macok&#39;s (martin.macok(a)underground.cz) &quot;cosmetics
  patch&quot;, which fixes a few typos and minor problems.

<li>  Implemented a huge OS fingerprint database update.  The number of
  fingerprints increased more than 20% to 1,353 and many of the
  existing ones are much improved.  Notable updates include the fourth
  edition of Bell Lab&#39;s Plan9, Grandstream&#39;s BugeTone 101 IP Phone,
  and Bart&#39;s Network Boot Disk 2.7 (which runs MS-DOS).  Oh, and Linux
  kernels up to 2.6.8, dozens of new Windows fingerprints including XP
  SP2, the latest Longhorn warez, and many modified Xboxes, OpenBSD
  3.6, NetBSD up to 2.0RC4, Apple&#39;s AirPort Express WAP and OS X
  10.3.3 (Panther) release, Novell Netware 6.5, FreeBSD 5.3-BETA, a
  bunch of Linksys and D-Link consumer junk, the latest Cisco IOS 12.2
  releases, a ton of miscellaneous broadband routers and printers, and
  much more.
</li><li>  Updated nmap-mac-prefixes with the latest OUIs from the IEEE.
</li><li>  Updated nmap-protocols with the latest IP protocols from IANA
</li><li>  Added a few new Nmap version detection signatures thanks to a patch
  from Martin Macok (martin.macok(a)underground.cz).
</li><li>  Fixed a crash problem in the Windows version of Nmap, thanks to a
  patch from Ganga Bhavani GBhavani(a)everdreamcorp.com).
</li><li>  Fixed Windows service scan crashes that occur with the error message
  &quot;Unexpected nsock_loop error. Error code 10022 (Unknown error)&quot;.  It
  turns out that Windows does not allow select() calls with all three
  FD sets empty.  Lame.  The Linux select() man page even suggests
  calling &quot;select with all three sets empty, n zero, and a non-null
  timeout as a fairly portable way to sleep with subsecond precision.&quot;
  Thanks to Gisle Vanem (giva(a)bgnett.no) for debugging help.
</li><li>  Added --max_scan_delay parameter.  Nmap will sometimes increase the
  delay itself when it detects many dropped packets.  For example,
  Solaris systems tend to respond with only one ICMP port unreachable
  packet per second during a UDP scan.  So Nmap will try to detect
  this and lower its rate of UDP probes to one per second.  This can
  provide more accurate results while reducing network congestion, but
  it can slow the scans down substantially.  By default (with no -T
  options specified), Nmap allows this delay to grow to one second per
  probe.  This option allows you to set a lower or higher maximum.
  The -T4 and -T5 scan modes now limit the maximum scan delay for TCP
  scans to 10 and 5 ms, respectively.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug that prevented RPC scan (-sR) from working for UDP ports
  unless service detection (-sV) was used.  -sV is still usually a
  better approach than -sR, as the latter ONLY handles RPC.  Thanks to
  Stephen Bishop (sbishop(a)idsec.co.uk) for reporting the problem and
  sending a patch.
</li><li>  Fixed nmap_fetchfile() to better find custom versions of data files
  such as nmap-services.  Note that the implicitly read directory
  should be ~/.nmap rather than ~/nmap .  So you may have to move any
  customized files you now have in ~/nmap .  Thanks to nnposter
  (nnposter(a)users.sourceforge.net) for reporting the problem and
  sending a patch.
</li><li>  Changed XML output so that the MAC address &lt;address&gt; element comes
  right after the IPv4/IPv6 &lt;address&gt; element.  Apparently this is
  needed to comply with the DTD ( <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.dtd">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.dtd</a> ).
  Thanks to Adam Morgan (adam.morgan(a)Q1Labs.com) and Florian Ebner
  (Florian.Ebner(a)e-bros.de) for the problem reports.
</li><li>  Fixed an error in the Nmap RPM spec file reported by Pascal Trouvin
  (pascal.trouvin(a)wanadoo.fr)
</li><li>  Fixed a timing problem in which a specified large --send_delay would
  sometimes be reduced to 1 second during a scan.  Thanks to Martin
  Macok (martin.macok(a)underground.cz) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed a timing problem with sneaky and paranoid modes (-T1 and -T0)
  which would cause Nmap to continually scan the same port and never
  hit other ports when scanning certain firewalled hosts.  Thanks to
  Curtis Doty (Curtis(a)GreenKey.net) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug in the build system that caused most Nmap subdirectories
  to be configured twice.  Changing the variable holding the name of
  subdirs from $subdirs to $nmap_cfg_subdirs resolved the problem --
  configure must have been using that variable name for its own internal
  operations.  Anyway, this should reduce compile time significantly.
</li><li>  Made a trivial change to nsock/src/nsock_event.c to work around a &quot;a
  bug in GCC 3.3.1 on FreeBSD/sparc64&quot;.  I found the patch by digging
  around the FreeBSD ports tree repository.  It would be nice if the
  FreeBSD Nmap port maintainers would report such things to me, rather
  than fixing it in their own Nmap tree and then applying the patch to
  every future version.  On the other hand, they deserve some sort of
  &quot;most up-to-date&quot; award.  I stuck Nmap 3.71-PRE1 in the dist
  directory for a few people to test, and made no announcement or
  direct link.  The FreeBSD crew found it and upgraded anyway :).  The
  gcc-workaround patch was apparently submitted to the FreeBSD folks
  by Marius Strobl (marius(a)alchemy.franken.de).
</li><li>  Fixed (I hope) an OS detection timing issue which would in some
  cases lead to the warning that &quot;insufficient responses for TCP
  sequencing (3), OS detection may be less accurate.&quot;  Thanks to Adam
  Kerrison (adam(a)tideway.com) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Modified the warning given when files such as nmap-services exist in
  both the compiled in NMAPDATADIR and the current working directory.
  That message should now only appear once and is more clear.
</li><li>  Fixed ping scan subsystem to work a little bit better when
  --scan_delay (or some of the slower -T templates which include a scan
  delay) is specified.  Thanks to Shahid Khan (khan(a)asia.apple.com)
  for suggestions.
</li><li>  Taught connect() scan to properly interpret ICMP protocol
  unreachable messages.  Thanks to Alan Bishoff
  (abishoff(a)arc.nasa.gov) for the report.
</li><li>  Improved the nmapfe.desktop file to better comply with standards.
  Thanks to Stephane Loeuillet (stephane.loeuillet(a)tiscali.fr) for
  sending the patch.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 3.70 [2004-8-31] <a class="versionlink" id="3.70" href="#3.70" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Rewrote core port scanning engine, which is now named ultra_scan().
  Improved algorithms make this faster (often dramatically so) in
  almost all cases.  Not only is it superior against single hosts, but
  ultra_scan() can scan many hosts (sometimes hundreds) in parallel.
  This offers many efficiency/speed advantages.  For example, hosts
  often limit the ICMP port unreachable packets used by UDP scans to
  1/second.  That made those scans extraordinarily slow in previous
  versions of Nmap.  But if you are scanning 100 hosts at once,
  suddenly you can receive 100 responses per second.  Spreading the
  scan amongst hosts is also gentler toward the target hosts.  Nmap
  can still scan many ports at the same time, as well.  If you find
  cases where ultra_scan is slower or less accurate, please send a
  report (including exact command-lines, versions used, and output, if
  possible) to Fyodor.
</li><li>  Added --max_hostgroup option which specifies the maximum number of
  hosts that Nmap is allowed to scan in parallel.
</li><li>  Added --min_hostgroup option which specifies the minimum number of
  hosts that Nmap should scan in parallel (there are some exceptions
  where Nmap will still scan smaller groups -- see man page).  Of
  course, Nmap will try to choose efficient values even if you don&#39;t
  specify hostgroup restrictions explicitly.
</li><li>  Rewrote TCP SYN, ACK, Window, and Connect() scans to use
  ultra_scan() framework, rather than the old pos_scan().
</li><li>  Rewrote FIN, Xmas, NULL, Maimon, UDP, and IP Protocol scans to use
  ultra_scan(), rather than the old super_scan().
</li><li>  Overhauled UDP scan.  Ports that don&#39;t respond are now classified as
  &quot;open|filtered&quot; (open or filtered) rather than &quot;open&quot;.  The (somewhat
  rare) ports that actually respond with a UDP packet to the empty
  probe are considered open.  If version detection is requested, it
  will be performed on open|filtered ports.  Any that respond to any of
  the UDP probes will have their status changed to open.  This avoids a
  the false-positive problem where filtered UDP ports appear to be
  open, leading to terrified newbies thinking their machine is
  infected by back orifice.
</li><li>  Nmap now estimates completion times for almost all port scan types
  (any that use ultra_scan()) as well as service scan (version
  detection).  These are only shown in verbose mode (-v).  On scans
  that take more than a minute or two, you will see occasional updates
  like:
  SYN Stealth Scan Timing: About 30.01% done; ETC: 16:04 (0:01:09 remaining)
  New updates are given if the estimates change significantly.
</li><li>  Added --exclude option, which lets you specify a comma-separated
  list of targets (hosts, ranges, netblocks) that should be excluded
  from the scan.  This is useful to keep from scanning yourself, your
  ISP, particularly sensitive hosts, etc.  The new --excludefile reads
  the list (newline-delimited) from a given file.  All the work was
  done by Mark-David McLaughlin (mdmcl(a)cisco.com&gt; and William McVey
  ( wam(a)cisco.com ), who sent me a well-designed and well-tested
  patch.
</li><li>  Nmap now has a &quot;port scan ping&quot; system.  If it has received at least
  one response from any port on the host, but has not received
  responses lately (usually due to filtering), Nmap will &quot;ping&quot; that
  known-good port occasionally to detect latency, packet drop rate,
  etc.
</li><li>  Service/version detection now handles multiple hosts at once for
  more efficient and less-intrusive operation.
</li><li>  Nmap now wishes itself a happy birthday when run on September 1 in
  verbose mode!  The first public release was on that date in 1997.
</li><li>  The port randomizer now has a bias toward putting
  commonly-accessible ports (80, 22, etc.) near the beginning of the
  list.  Getting a response early helps Nmap calculate response times and
  detect packet loss, so the scan goes faster.
</li><li>  Host timeout system (--host_timeout) overhauled to support host
  parallelization.  Hosts times are tracked separately, so a host that
  finishes a SYN scan quickly is not penalized for an exceptionally
  slow host being scanned at the same time.
</li><li>  When Nmap has not received any responses from a host, it can now
  use certain timing values from other hosts from the same scan
  group.  This way Nmap doesn&#39;t have to use absolute-worst-case
  (300bps SLIP link to Uzbekistan) round trip timeouts and such.
</li><li>  Enabled MAC address reporting when using the Windows version
  of Nmap.  Thanks to Andy Lutomirski (luto(a)stanford.edu) for
  writing and sending the patch.
</li><li>  Workaround crippled raw sockets on Microsoft Windows XP SP2 scans.
  I applied a patch by Andy Lutomirski (luto(a)stanford.edu) which
  causes Nmap to default to WinPcap sends instead.  The WinPcap send
  functionality was already there for versions of Windows such as NT and
  Win98 that never supported Raw Sockets in the first place.
</li><li>  Changed how Nmap sends ARP requests on Windows to use the iphlpapi
  SendARP() function rather than creating it raw and reading the
  response from the Windows ARP cache.  This works around a
  (reasonable) feature of Windows Firewall which ignored such
  unsolicited responses.  The firewall is turned on by default as of
  Windows XP SP2.  This change was implemented by Dana Epp
  (dana(a)vulscan.com).
</li><li>  Fixed some Windows portability issues discovered by Gisle Vanem
  (giva(a)bgnett.no).
</li><li>  Upgraded libpcap from version 0.7.2 to 0.8.3.  This was an attempt
  to fix an annoying bug, which I then found was actually in my code
  rather than libpcap :).
</li><li>  Removed Ident scan (-I).  It was rarely useful, and the
  implementation would have to be rewritten for the new ultra_scan()
  system.  If there is significant demand, perhaps I&#39;ll put it back in
  sometime.
</li><li>  Documented the --osscan_limit option, which saves time by skipping
  OS detection if at least one open and one closed port are not found on
  the remote hosts.  OS detection is much less reliable against such
  hosts anyway, and skipping it can save some time.
</li><li>  Updated nmapfe.desktop file to provide better NmapFE desktop support
  under Fedora Core and other systems.  Thanks to Mephisto
  (mephisto(a)mephisto.ma.cx) for sending the patch.
</li><li>  Further nmapfe.desktop changes to better fit the freedesktop
  standard.  The patch came from Murphy (m3rf(a)swimmingnoodle.com).
</li><li>  Fixed capitalization (with a Perl script) of many over-capitalized
  vendor names in nmap-mac-prefixes.
</li><li>  Ensured that MAC address vendor names are always escaped in XML
  output if they contain illegal characters (particularly &#39;&amp;&#39;).  Thanks
  to Matthieu Verbert (mve(a)zurich.ibm.com) for the report and a patch.
</li><li>  Changed xmloutputversion in XML output from 1.0 to 1.01 to note that
  there was a slight change (which was actually the MAC stuff in 3.55).
  Thanks to Lionel CONS (lionel.cons(a)cern.ch) for the suggestion.
</li><li>  Many Windows portability fix and bug fixes, thanks to patch from
  Gisle Vanem (giva(a)bgnett.no).  With these changes, he was able to
  compile Nmap on Windows using MingW + gcc 3.4 C++ rather than MS
  Visual Studio.
</li><li>  Removed (addport) tags from XML output.  They used to provide open
  ports as they were discovered, but don&#39;t work now that the port
  scanners scan many hosts at once.  They did not specify an IP
  address.  Of course the appropriate (port) tags are still printed
  once scanning of a target is complete.
</li><li>  Configure script now detects GNU/k*BSD systems (whatever those are),
  thanks to patch from Robert Millan (rmh(a)debian.org)
</li><li>  Fixed various crashes and assertion failures related to the new
  ultra_scan() system, that were found by Arturo &quot;Buanzo&quot; Busleiman
  (buanzo(a)buanzo.com.ar), Eric (catastrophe.net), and Bill Petersen
  (bill.petersen(a)alcatel.com).
</li><li>  Fixed some minor memory leaks relating to ping and list scanning as
  well as the Nmap output table.  These were found with Valgrind (
  <a href="http://valgrind.kde.org">http://valgrind.kde.org</a>/ ).
</li><li>  Provide limited --packet_trace support for TCP connect() (-sT)
  scans.
</li><li>  Fixed compilation on certain Solaris machines thanks to a patch by
  Tom Duffy (tduffy(a)sun.com)
</li><li>  Fixed some warnings that crop up when compiling Nbase C files with a
  C++ compiler.  Thanks to Gisle Vanem (giva(a)bgnett.no) for sending
  the patch.
</li><li>  Tweaked the License blurb on source files and in the man page.  It
  clarifies some issues and includes a new GPL exception that
  explicitly allows linking with the OpenSSL library.  Some people
  believe that the GPL and OpenSSL licenses are incompatible without
  this special exception.
</li><li>  Fixed some serious runtime portability issues on *BSD systems.
  Thanks to Eric (catastrophe.net) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  Changed the argument parser to better detect bogus arguments to the
  -iR option.
</li><li>  Removed a spurious warning message relating to the Windows ARP cache
  being empty.  Patch by Gisle Vanem (giva(a)bgnett.no).
</li><li>  Removed some C++-style line comments (//) from nbase, because some C
  compilers (particularly on Solaris) barf on those.  Problem reported
  by Raju Alluri &lt;Raju.Alluri(a)Sun.COM&gt;

<li>  Added MAC address printing.  If Nmap receives packet from a target
  machine which is on an Ethernet segment directly connected to the
  scanning machine, Nmap will print out the target MAC address.  Nmap
  also now contains a database (derived from the official IEEE
  version) which it uses to determine the vendor name of the target
  ethernet interface.  The Windows version of Nmap does not yet have
  this capability.  If any Windows developer types are interesting in
  adding it, you just need to implement IPisDirectlyConnected() in
  tcpip.cc and then please send me the patch.  Here are examples from
  normal and XML output:
  MAC Address: 08:00:20:8F:6B:2F (SUN Microsystems)
  &lt;address addr=&quot;00:A0:CC:63:85:4B&quot; vendor=&quot;Lite-on Communications&quot; addrtype=&quot;mac&quot; /&gt;
</li><li>  Updated the XML DTD to support the newly printed MAC addresses.
  Thanks to Thorsten Holz (thorsten.holz(a)mmweg.rwth-aachen.de) for
  sending this patch.
</li><li>  Added a bunch of new and fixed service fingerprints for version
  detection.  These are from Martin Macok
  (martin.macok(a)underground.cz).
</li><li>  Normalized many of the OS names in nmap-os-fingerprints (fixed
  capitalization, typos, etc.).  Thanks to Royce Williams
  (royce(a)alaska.net) and Ping Huang (pshuang(a)alum.mit.edu) for
  sending patches.
</li><li>  Modified the mswine32/nmap_performance.reg Windows registry file to
  use an older and more compatible version.  It also now includes the
  value &quot;StrictTimeWaitSeqCheck&quot;=dword:00000001 , as suggested by Jim
  Harrison (jmharr(a)microsoft.com).  Without that latter value, the
  TcpTimedWaitDelay value apparently isn&#39;t checked.  Windows users
  should apply the new registry changes by clicking on the .reg file.
  Or do it manually as described in README-WIN32.  This file is also
  now available in the data directory at
  <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap_performance.reg">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap_performance.reg</a>
</li><li>  Applied patch from Gisle Vanem (giva(a)bgnett.no) which allows the
  Windows version of Nmap to work with WinPCAP 3.1BETA (and probably
  future releases).  The WinPcap folks apparently changed the encoding
  of adapter names in this release.
</li><li>  Fixed a ping scanning bug that would cause this error message: &quot;nmap:
  targets.cc:196: int hostupdate (Target **, Target *, int, int, int,
  timeout_info *, timeval *, timeval *, pingtune *, tcpqueryinfo *,
  pingstyle): Assertion `pt-&gt;down_this_block &gt; 0&#39; failed.&quot;  Thanks to
  Beirne Konarski (beirne(a)neo.rr.com) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  If a user attempts -PO (the letter O), print an error suggesting
  that they probably mean -P0 (Zero) to disable ping scanning.
</li><li>  Applied a couple patches (with minor changes) from Oliver Eikemeier
  (eikemeier(a)fillmore-labs.com) which fix an edge case relating to
  decoy scanning IP ranges that must be sent through different
  interfaces, and improves the Nmap response to certain error codes
  returned by the FreeBSD firewall system.  The patches are from
  <a href="http://cvsweb.freebsd.org/ports/security/nmap/files">http://cvsweb.freebsd.org/ports/security/nmap/files</a>/ .
</li><li>  Many people have reported this error: &quot;checking for type of 6th
  argument to recvfrom()... configure: error: Cannot find type for 6th
  argument to recvfrom()&quot;.  In most cases, the cause was a missing or
  broken C++ compiler.  That should now be detected earlier with a
  clearer message.
</li><li>  Fixed the FTP bounce scan to better detect filtered ports on the
  target network.
</li><li>  Fixed some minor bugs related to the new MAC address printing
  feature.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem with UDP-scanning port 0, which was reported by
  Sebastian Wolfgarten (sebastian(a)wolfgarten.com).
</li><li>  Applied patch from Ruediger Rissmann (RRI(a)zurich.ibm.com), which
  helps Nmap understand an EACCESS error, which can happen at least
  during IPv6 scans from certain platforms to some firewalled targets.
</li><li>  Renamed ACK ping scan option from -PT to -PA in the documentation.
  Nmap has accepted both names for years and will continue to do
  so.
</li><li>  Removed the notice that Nmap is reading target specifications from a
  file or stdin when you specify the -iL option.  It was sometimes
  printed to stdout even when you wanted to redirect XML or grepable
  output there, because it was printed during options processing before
  output files were handled.  This change was suggested by Anders Thulin
  (ath(a)algonet.se).
</li><li>  Added --source_port as a longer, but hopefully easier to remember,
  alias for -g.  In other words, it tries to use the constant source
  port number you specify for probes.  This can help against poorly
  configured firewalls that trust source port 20, 53, and the like.
</li><li>  Removed undocumented (and useless) -N option.
</li><li>  Fixed a version detection crash reported in excellent detail by
  Jedi/Sector One (j(a)pureftpd.org).
</li><li>  Applied patch from Matt Selsky (selsky(a)columbia.edu) which helps
  Nmap build with OpenSSL.
</li><li>  Modified the configure/build system to fix library ordering problems
  that prevented Nmap from building on certain platforms.  Thanks to
  Greg A. Woods (woods(a)weird.com) and Saravanan
  (saravanan_kovai(a)HotPop.com) for the suggestions.
</li><li>  Applied a patch to Makefile.in from Scott Mansfield
  (thephantom(a)mac.com) which enables the use of a DESTDIR variable
  to install the whole Nmap directory structure under a different root
  directory.  The configure --prefix option would do the same thing in
  this case, but DESTDIR is apparently a standard that package
  maintainers like Scott are used to.  An example usage is
  &quot;make DESTDIR=/tmp/packageroot&quot;.
</li><li>  Removed unnecessary <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/banner.html">banner</a> printing in the non-root connect() ping
  scan.  Thanks to Tom Rune Flo (tom(a)x86.no) for the suggestion and
  a patch.
</li><li>  Updated the headers at the top of each source file (mostly to
  advance the copyright year to 2004 and note that Nmap is a registered
  trademark).
</li><li>  The SInfo line of submitted fingerprints now provides the target&#39;s
  OUI (first three bytes of the MAC address) if available.  Example:
  &quot;M=00A0CC&quot;.  To save a couple bytes, the &quot;Time&quot; field in SInfo has
  been renamed to &quot;Tm&quot;.  The OUI helps identify the device vendor, and
  is only available when the source and target machines are on the
  same ethernet network.

<li>  Integrated a ton of service fingerprints, increasing the number of
  signatures more than 50%.  It has now exceeded 1,000 for the first
  time, and represents 180 unique service protocols from acap, afp,
  and aim to xml-rpc, zebedee, and zebra.
</li><li>  Implemented a huge OS fingerprint update.  The number of
  fingerprints has increased more than 13% to 1,121.  This is the first
  time it has exceeded 1000.  Notable updates include Linux 2.6.0, Mac
  OS X up to 10.3.2 (Panther), OpenBSD 3.4 (normal and pf &quot;scrub all&quot;),
  FreeBSD 5.2, the latest Windows Longhorn warez, and Cisco PIX 6.3.3.
  As usual, there are a ton of new consumer devices from ubiquitous
  D-Link, Linksys, and Netgear broadband routers to a number of new IP
  phones including the Cisco devices commonly used by Vonage.  Linksys
  has apparently gone special-purpose with some of their devices, such
  as their WGA54G &quot;Wireless Game Adapter&quot; and WPS54GU2 wireless print
  server.  A cute little MP3 player called the Rio Karma was submitted
  multiple times and I also received and integrated fingerprints for the
  Handspring Treo 600 (PalmOS).
</li><li>  Applied some man page fixes from Eric S. Raymond
  (esr(a)snark.thyrsus.com).
</li><li>  Added version scan information to grepable output between the last
  two &#39;/&#39; delimiters (that space was previously unused).  So the format
  is now &quot;portnum/state/protocol/owner/servicename/rpcinfo/versioninfo&quot;
  as in &quot;53/open/tcp//domain//ISC Bind 9.2.1/&quot; and
  &quot;22/open/tcp//ssh//OpenSSH 3.5p1 (protocol 1.99)/&quot;.  Thanks to
  MadHat (madhat(a)unspecific.com) for sending a patch (although I did
  it differently).  Note that any &#39;/&#39; characters in the
  version (or owner) field are replaced with &#39;|&#39; to keep awk/cut
  parsing simple.  The service name field has been updated so that it
  is the same as in normal output (except for the same sort of
  escaping discussed above).
</li><li>  Integrated an Oracle TNS service probe and match lines contributed
  by Frank Berger (fm.berger(a)gmx.de).  New probe contributions are
  always appreciated!
</li><li>  Fixed a crash that could happen during SSL version detection due to
  SSL session ID cache reference counting issues.
</li><li>  Applied patch from Rob Foehl (rwf(a)loonybin.net) which fixes the
  --with_openssl=DIR configure argument.
</li><li>  Applied patch to nmap XML dtd (nmap.dtd) from Mario Manno
  (mm(a)koeln.ccc.de).  This accounts for the new version scanning
  functionality.
</li><li>  Updated the Windows build system so that you don&#39;t have to manually
  copy nmap-service-probes to the output directory.  I also updated
  the README-WIN32 to elaborate further on the build process.
</li><li>  Added configure option --with-libpcre=included which causes Nmap to
  build with its included version of libpcre even if an acceptable
  version is available on the system.
</li><li>  Upgraded to Autoconf 2.59 (from 2.57).  This should help HP-UX
  compilation problems reported by Petter Reinholdtsen
  (pere(a)hungry.com) and may have other benefits as well.
</li><li>  Applied patch from Przemek Galczewski (sako(a)avet.com.pl) which
  adds spaces to the XML output in places that apparently help certain
  older XML parsers.
</li><li>  Made Ident-scan (-I) limits on the length and type of responses
  stricter so that rogue servers can&#39;t flood your screen with 1024
  characters.  The new length limit is 32.  Thanks to Tom Rune Flo
  (tom(a)x86.no) for the suggestion and a patch.
</li><li>  Fingerprints for unrecognized services can now be a bit longer to
  avoid truncating as much useful response information.  While the
  fingerprints can be longer now, I hope they will be less frequent
  because of all the newly recognized services in this version.
</li><li>  The nmap-service-probes &quot;match&quot; directive can now take a service
  name like &quot;ssl/vmware-auth&quot;.  The service will then be reported as
  vmware-auth (or whatever follows &quot;ssl/&quot;) tunneled by SSL, yet Nmap
  won&#39;t actually bother initiating an SSL connection.  This is useful
  for SSL services which can be fully recognized without the overhead
  of making an SSL connection.
</li><li>  Version scan now chops commas and whitespace from the end of
  vendorproductname, version, and info fields.  This makes it easier to
  write templates incorporating lists.  For example, the tcpmux service
  (TCP port 1) gives a list of supported services separated by CRLF.
  Nmap uses this new feature to print them comma separated without
  having an annoying trailing comma as so (linewrapped):
<pre>
   match tcpmux m|^(sgi_[-.\w]+\r\n([-.\w]+\r\n)*)$|
        v/SGI IRIX tcpmux//Available services: $SUBST(1, &quot;\r\n&quot;, &quot;,&quot;)/</pre>

<li>  Integrated an enormous number of version detection service
  submissions.  The database has almost doubled in size to 663
  signatures representing the following 130 services:

    winshell wms X11 xfce zebra</pre>
</li><li>  Added the ability to execute &quot;helper functions&quot; in version
  templates, to help clean up/manipulate data captured from a server
  response.  The first defined function is P() which includes only
  printable characters in a captured string.  The main impetus for
  this is to deal with Unicode strings like
  &quot;W\0O\0R\0K\0G\0R\0O\0U\0P\0&quot; that many MS protocols send.  Nmap can
  now decode that into &quot;WORKGROUP&quot;.
</li><li>  Added SUBST() helper function, which replaces strings in matched
  appname/version/extrainfo strings with something else.  For example,
  VanDyke Vshell gives a <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/banner.html">banner</a> that includes
  &quot;SSH-2\.0-VShell_2_2_0_528&quot;.  A substring match is used to pick out
  the string &quot;2_2_0_528&quot;, and then SUB21ST(1,&quot;_&quot;,&quot;.&quot;) is called on that
  match to form the version number 2.2.0.528.
</li><li>  If responses to a probe fail to match any of the registered match
  strings for that probe, Nmap will now try against the registered &quot;null
  probe&quot; match strings.  This helps in the case that the NULL probe
  initially times out (perhaps because of initial DNS lookup) but the
  <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/banner.html">banner</a> appears in later responses.
</li><li>  Applied some portability fixes (particularly for OpenBSD) from Chad
  Loder (cloder(a)loder.us), who is also now the OpenBSD Nmap port
  maintainer.
</li><li>  Applied some portability fixes from Marius Strobl
  (marius(a)alchemy.franken.de).
</li><li>  The tarball distribution of Nmap now strips the binary at install
  time thanks to a patch from Marius Strobl
  (marius(a)alchemy.franken.de).
</li><li>  Fixed a problem related to building Nmap on systems that lack PCRE
  libs (and thus have to use the ones included by Nmap).  Thanks to Remi
  Denis-Courmont (deniscr6(a)cti.ecp.fr) for the report and patch.
</li><li>  Alphabetized the service names in each Probe section in
  nmap-service-probes (makes them easier to find and add to).
</li><li>  Fixed the problem several people reported where Nmap would quit with
  a &quot;broken pipe&quot; error during service scanning.  Thanks to Jari Ruusu
  (jari.ruusu(a)pp.inet.fi) for sending a patch.  The actual error
  message was &quot;Unexpected error in NSE_TYPE_READ callback.  Error
  code: 32 (Broken pipe)&quot;
</li><li>  Fixed protocol scan (-sO), which I had broken when adding the new
  output table format.  It would complain &quot;NmapOutputTable.cc:128:
  failed assertion `row &lt; numRows&#39;&quot;.  Thanks to Matt Burnett
  (marukka(a)mac.com) for notifying me of the problem.
</li><li>  Upgraded Libpcap to the latest tcpdump.org version (0.7.2) from
  0.7.1
</li><li>  Applied a patch from Peter Marschall (peter(a)adpm.de) which adds
  version detection support to nmapfe.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem with XML output being invalid when service detection
  was done on SSL-tunneled ports.  Thanks to the several people who
  reported this - it means that folks are actually using the XML
  output :).
</li><li>  Fixed (I hope) some Solaris Sun ONE compiler compilation problems
  reported (w/patches) by Mikael Mannstrom (candyman(a)penti.org)
</li><li>  Fixed the --with-openssl configure option for people who have
  OpenSSL installed in a path not automatically found by their
  compilers.  Thanks to Marius Strobl (marius(a)alchemy.franken.de) for
  the patch.
</li><li>  Made some portability changes for HP-UX and possibly other types of
  machines, thanks to a patch from Petter Reinholdtsen (pere(a)hungry.com)
</li><li>  Applied a patch from Matt Selsky (selsky(a)columbia.edu) which fixes
  compilation on some Solaris boxes, and maybe others.  The error said
  &quot;cannot compute sizeof (char)&quot;
</li><li>  Applied some patches from the NetBSD ports tree that Hubert Feyrer
  (hubert.feyrer(a)informatik.fh-regensburg.de) sent me.  The NetBSD
  Nmap ports page is at <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/packages/net/nmap">http://www.NetBSD.org/packages/net/nmap</a>/ .
</li><li>  Applied some Makefile patches from the FreeBSD ports tree that I
  found at <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/security/nmap/files/">http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/security/nmap/files/</a>

<li>  Integrated more service signatures from MadHat
  (madhat(a)unspecific.com), Brian Hatch (bri(a)ifokr.org), Niels
  Heinen (zillion(a)safemode.org), Solar Designer
  (solar(a)openwall.com), Seth Master
  (smaster(a)stanford.edu), and Curt Wilson
  (netw3_security(a)hushmail.com).  We now have 378 signatures
  recognizing 86 unique service protocols.
</li><li>  Added new HTTPOptions and RTSPRequest probes suggested by MadHat
  (madhat(a)unspecific.com)
</li><li>  Changed the .spec file to compile Nmap RPMs without SSL support to
  improve compatibility (Some users might not have OpenSSL, and even
  those who do might not have the right version (libopenssl.so.2 vs
  libopenssl.so.4, etc).
</li><li>  Applied a patch from Solar Eclipse (solareclipse(a)phreedom.org)
  which increases the allowed size of the &#39;extrainfo&#39; version field from
  80 characters to 128.  The main benefit is to allow longer apache module
  version strings.
</li><li>  Fixed Windows compilation and improved the Windows port slightly (no
  more macro to redefine read().
</li><li>  Applied some updates to README-WIN32 sent in by Kirby Kuehl
  (kkuehl(a)cisco.com).  He improved the list of suggested registry
  changes and also fixed a typo or two.  He also attached a .reg file
  automate the Nmap connect() scan performance enhancing registry
  changes.  I am now including that with the Nmap Windows binary .zip
  distribution (and in mswin32/ of the source distro).
</li><li>  Applied a one-line patch from Dmitry V. Levin (ldv(a)altlinux.org)
  which fixes a test Nmap does during compilation to see if an existing
  libpcap installation is recent enough.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 3.40PVT17 [2003-9-12] <a class="versionlink" id="3.40PVT17" href="#3.40PVT17" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Wrote and posted a new paper on version scanning to
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html">https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html</a> .  Updated nmap-service-probes and
  the Nmap man page to simply refer to this URL.

  contributions from Brian Hatch (bri(a)ifokr.org), MadHat
  (madhat(a)unspecific.com), Max Vision (vision(a)whitehats.com), HD
  Moore (hdm(a)digitaloffense.net), Seth Master
  (smaster(a)stanford.edu), and Niels Heinen (zillion(a)safemode.org).
  MadHat also contributed a new probe for Windows Media Service.  Many
  people set a LOT of signatures, which has allowed
  nmap-service-probes to grow from 295 to 356 signatures representing
  85 service protocols!
</li><li>  Applied a patch (with slight changes) from Brian Hatch
  (bri(a)ifokr.org) which enables caching of SSL sessions so that
  negotiation doesn&#39;t have to be repeated when Nmap reconnects to the same
  between probes.
</li><li>  Applied a patch from Brian Hatch (bri(a)ifokr.org) which optimizes the
  requested SSL ciphers for speed rather than security.  The list was
  based on empirical evidence from substantial benchmarking he did with
  tests that resemble nmap-service-scanning.
</li><li>  Updated the Nmap man page to discuss the new version scanning
  options (-sV, -A).
</li><li>  I now include nmap-version/aclocal.m4 in the distribution as this is
  required to rebuild the configure script (thanks to Dmitry V. Levin
  (ldv(a)altlinux.org) for notifying me of the problem).
</li><li>  Applied a patch from Dmitry V. Levin (ldv(a)altlinux.org) which
  detects whether the PCRE include file is &lt;pcre.h&gt; or &lt;pcre
</li><li>  Applied a patch from Dmitry V. Levin (ldv(a)altlinux.org) which
  fixes typos in some error messages.  The patch apparently came from
  the highly-secure and stable Owl and Alt Linux distributions.  Check
  them out at <a href="http://www.openwall.com/Owl">http://www.openwall.com/Owl</a>/ and
  <a href="http://www.altlinux.com/">http://www.altlinux.com/</a>
</li><li>  Fixed compilation on Mac OS X - thanks to Brian Hatch
  (bri(a)ifokr.org&gt; and Ryan Lowe (rlowe(a)pablowe.net) for giving me
  access to Mac OS X boxes.
</li><li>  Stripped down libpcre build system to remove libtool dependency and
  other cruft that Nmap doesn&#39;t need (this was mostly a response to
  libtool-related issues on Mac OS X).
</li><li>  Added a new --version_trace option which causes Nmap to print out extensive
  debugging info about what version scanning is doing (this is a subset
  of what you would get with --packet_trace).  You should usually use
  this in combination with at least one -d option.
</li><li>  Fixed a port number printing bug that would cause Nmap service
  fingerprints to give a negative port number when the actual port was
  above 32K.  Thanks to Seth Master (smaster(a)stanford.edu) for finding
  this.
</li><li>  Updated all the header text again to clarify our interpretation of
  &quot;derived works&quot; after some suggestions from Brian Hatch
  (bri(a)ifokr.org)

  don&#39;t have struct sockaddr_storage.  Nsock now just uses &quot;struct
  sockaddr *&quot; like connect() does.
</li><li>  Fixed a bug found by Solar Designer which would cause the Nmap
  portscan table to be truncated in -oN output files if the results are
  very long.
</li><li>  Changed a bunch of large stack arrays (e.g. int portlookup[65536])

<li>  Added SSL-scan-through support.  If service detection finds a port to be
  SSL, it will transparently connect to the port using OpenSSL and use
  version detection to determine what service lies beneath.  This
  feature is only enabled if OpenSSL is available at build time.  A
  new --with-openssl=DIR configure option is available if OpenSSL is
  not in your default compiler paths.  You can use --without-openssl
  to disable this functionality.  Thanks to Brian Hatch
  (bri(a)ifokr.org) for sample code and other assistance.  Make sure
  you use a version without known exploitable overflows.  In
  particular, versions up to and including OpenSSL 0.9.6d and
  0.9.7-beta2 contained serious vulnerabilities described at
  <a href="http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20020730.txt">http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20020730.txt</a> .  Note that these
  vulnerabilities are well over a year old at the time of this
  writing.
</li><li>  Integrated many more services thanks to submissions from Brian
  Hatch, HellNBack ( hellnbak(a)nmrc.org ), MadHat, Solar Designer,
  Simple Nomad, and Shawn Wallis (swallis(a)ku.edu).  The number of
  signatures has grown from 242 to 271.  Thanks!
</li><li>  Integrated Novell Netware NCP and MS Terminal Server probes from
  Simple Nomad (thegnome(a)nmrc.org).
</li><li>  Fixed a segfault found by Solar Designer that could occur when
  scanning certain &quot;evil&quot; services.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem reported by Solar Designer and MadHat (
  madhat(a)unspecific.com ) where Nmap would bail when certain Apache
  version/info responses were particularly long.  It could happen in
  other cases as well.  Now Nmap just prints a warning.

<li>  Integrated many more services thanks to submissions from Simple
  Nomad, Solar Designer, jerickson(a)inphonic.com, Curt Wilson, and
  Marco Ivaldi.  Thanks!  The match line count has risen from 201 to 242.
</li><li>  Implemented a service classification scheme to separate the
  vendor/product name from the version number and any extra info that
  is provided.  Instead of v/[big version string]/, the new match
  lines include v/[vendor/productname]/[version]/[extrainfo]/ .  See
  the docs at the top of nmap-service-probes for more info.  This
  doesn&#39;t change the normal output (which lumps them together anyway),
  but they are separate in the XML so that higher-level programs can
  easily match against just a product name.  Here are a few examples
  of the improved service element:
<pre>
   &lt;service name=&quot;ssh&quot; product=&quot;OpenSSH&quot; version=&quot;3.1p1&quot;
      extrainfo=&quot;protocol 1.99&quot; method=&quot;probed&quot; conf=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;

   &lt;service name=&quot;rndc&quot; method=&quot;table&quot; conf=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;</pre>
</li><li>  I went through nmap-service-probes and added the vendor name to more
  entries.  I also added the service name where the product name
  itself didn&#39;t make that completely obvious.
</li><li>  SCO Corporation of Lindon, Utah (formerly Caldera) has lately taken
  to an extortion campaign of demanding license fees from Linux users
  for code that they themselves knowingly distributed under the terms
  of the GNU GPL.  They have also refused to accept the GPL, claiming
  that some preposterous theory of theirs makes it invalid.  Meanwhile
  they have distributed GPL-licensed Nmap in (at least) their
  &quot;Supplemental Open Source CD&quot;.  In response to these blatant
  violations, and in accordance with section 4 of the GPL, we hereby
  terminate SCO&#39;s rights to redistribute any versions of Nmap in any
  of their products, including (without limitation) OpenLinux,
  Skunkware, OpenServer, and UNIXWare.

<li>  Added &quot;soft matches&quot;.  These are similar to normal match lines in
  that they provide a regex for recognizing a service (but no version).
  But instead of stopping at softmatch service recognition, the scan
  continues looking for more info.  It only launches probes that are
  known-capable of matching the softmatched service.  If no version
  number is found, at least the determined service is printed.  A
  service print for submission is also provided in that case.  So this
  provides more informative results and improves efficiency.
</li><li>  Cleaned up the Windows support a bit and did more testing and
  fixing.  Windows service detection seems to be working fine for me
  now, although my testing is still pretty limited.  This release
  includes a Windows binary distribution and the README-WIN32 has been
  updated to reflect new compilation instructions.
</li><li>  More service fingerprints!  Thanks to Solar Designer, Max Vision,
  Frank Denis (Jedi/Sector One) for the submissions.  I also added a
  bunch from my own testing. The number of match lines went from 179
  to 201.
</li><li>  Updated XML output to handle new version and service detection
  information.  Here are a few examples of the new output:
<pre>
   &lt;port protocol=&quot;tcp&quot; portid=&quot;22&quot;&gt;&lt;state state=&quot;open&quot; /&gt;&lt;service
     name=&quot;ssh&quot; version=&quot;OpenSSH 3.1p1 (protocol 1.99)&quot; method=&quot;probed&quot;

</li><li>  Fixed issue where Nmap would quit when ECONNREFUSED was returned
  when we try to read from an already-connected TCP socket.  FreeBSD
  does this for some reason instead of giving ECONNRESET.  Thanks to
  Will Saxon (WillS(a)housing.ufl.edu) for the report.
</li><li>  Removed the SERVICEMATCH_STATIC match type from
  nmap-service-probes.  There wasn&#39;t much benefit of this over regular
  expressions, so it isn&#39;t worth maintaining the extra code.

  works (I didn&#39;t test very deeply) on my WinXP box with VS.Net 2003.
  I try to work out remaining kinks and do some cleanup for the next
  version.  The Windows code was restructured and improved quite a bit,

<li>  Service scan is now OFF by default.  You can activate it with -sV.
  Or use the snazzy new -A (for &quot;All recommended features&quot; or

  detection.

<li>  Limited the size of service fingerprints to roughly 1024 bytes.
  This was suggested by Niels Heinen (niels(a)heinen.ws), because the previous
  limit was excessive.  The number of fingerprints printed is also now
  limited to 10.

  data and then close() during the NULL probe (when we haven&#39;t sent
  anything).
</li><li>  Applied a patch from Solar Designer (solar(a)openwall.com) which
  corrects some errors in the Russian man page translation and also a
  couple typos in the regular man page.  Then I spell-checked the man

<li>  Nmap now has a simple VERSION detection scheme.  The &#39;match&#39; lines in
  nmap-service-probes can specify a template version string
  (referencing subexpression matches from the regex in a Perl-like
  manner) so that the version is determined at the same time as the
  service.  This handles many common services in a highly efficient
  manner.  A more complex form of version detection (that initiates
  further communication w/the target service) may be necessary
  eventually to handle services that aren&#39;t as forthcoming with
  version details.
</li><li>  The Nmap port state table now wastes less whitespace due to using a new
  and stingy NmapOutputTable class.  This makes it easier to read, and
  also leaves more room for version info and possibly other enhancements.
</li><li>  Added &#39;s&#39; option to match lines in nmap-service-probes.  Just as
  with the Perl &#39;s&#39; option, this one causes &#39;.&#39; in the regular
  expression to match any character INCLUDING newline.
</li><li>  The WinPcap header timestamp is no longer used on Windows as it
  sometimes can be a couple seconds different than gettimeofday() (which
  is really _ftime() on Windows) for some reason.  Thanks to Scott
  Egbert (scott.egbert(a)citigroup.com) for the report.
</li><li>  Applied a patch by Matt Selsky (selsky(a)columbia.edu) which fixes
  configure.in in such a way that the annoying header file &quot;present but
  cannot be compiled&quot; warning for Solaris.
</li><li>  Applied another patch from Matt that (we hope) fixes the &quot;present
  but cannot be compiled&quot; warning -- this time for Mac OS X.
</li><li>  Port table header names are now capitalized (&quot;SERVICE&quot;, &quot;PORT&quot;, etc)

<li>  Initial implementation of service detection.  Nmap will now probe
  ports to determine what is listening, rather than guessing based on
  the nmap-services table lookup.  This can be very useful for
  services on unidentified ports and for UDP services where it is not
  always clear (without these probes) whether the port is really open
  or just firewalled.  It is also handy for when services are run on
  the well-known-port of another protocol -- this is happening more
  and more as users try to circumvent increasingly strict firewall
  policies.
</li><li>  Nmap now uses the excellent libpcre (Perl Compatible Regular
  Expressions) library from <a href="http://www.pcre.org">http://www.pcre.org</a>/ .  Many systems
  already have this, otherwise Nmap will use the copy it now includes.
  If your libpcre is hidden away in some nonstandard place, give
  ./configure the new --with-libpcre=DIR directive.
</li><li>  Nmap now uses the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).  This makes
  programming easier, but if it causes major portability or bloat
  problems, I&#39;ll reluctantly remove it.
</li><li>  Applied a patch from Javier Kohen (jkohen(a)coresecurity.com) which
  normalizes the names of many Microsoft entries in the
  nmap-os-fingerprints file.
</li><li>  Applied a patch by Florin Andrei (florin(a)sgi.com) to the Nmap RPM
  spec file.  This uses the &#39;Epoch&#39; flag to prevent the Redhat Network
  tool from marking my RPMs as &quot;obsolete&quot; and &quot;upgrading&quot; to earlier
  Redhat-built versions.  A compilation flag problem is also fixed.

<li>  Implemented the largest-ever OS fingerprint update!  Roughly 300
  fingerprints were added/modified.  These massive changes span the
  gamut from AIX 5.1 to the ZyXEL Prestige broadband router line.
  Notable updates include OpenBSD 3.3, FreeBSD 5.1, Mac OS X 10.2.6,
  Windows 2003 server, and more WAPs and broadband routers than you
  can shake a stick at.  Someone even submitted a fingerprint for
  Debian Linux running on the Microsoft Xbox.  You have to love that
  irony :).  Thanks to everyone who submitted fingerprints using the
  URL Nmap gives you when it gets a clean reading but is stumped.  The
  fingerprint DB now contains almost 1000 fingerprints.
</li><li>  Went through every one of the fingerprints to normalize the
  descriptions a bit.  I also looked up what all of the devices are
  (thanks E*Bay and Google!).  Results like &quot;Nexland ISB Pro800 Turbo&quot;
  and &quot;Siemens 300E Release 6.5&quot; are much more useful when you add the
  words &quot;cable modem&quot; and &quot;business phone system&quot;
</li><li>  Added a new classification system to nmap-os-fingerprints.  In
  addition to the standard text description, each entry is now
  classified by vendor name (e.g. Sun), underlying OS (e.g. Solaris),
  OS generation (e.g. 7), and device type (&quot;general purpose&quot;, router,
  switch, game console, etc).  This can be useful if you want to (say)
  locate and eliminate the SCO systems on a network, or find the
  wireless access points (WAPs) by scanning from the wired side.
</li><li>  Classification system described above is now used to print out a
  &quot;device type&quot; line and OS categories for matches.  The free-form
  English details are still printed as well.  Nmap can sometimes
  provide classifications even where it used to provide nothing
  because of &quot;too many matches&quot;.  These have been added to XML output
  as well.  They are not printed for the &quot;grepable output&quot;, as I
  consider that format deprecated.
</li><li>  Nmap will now sometimes guess in the &quot;no exact matches&quot; case, even
  if you don&#39;t use the secret --osscan_guess or -fuzzy options.
</li><li>  Applied another huge NmapFE patch from Peter Marschall
  (peter(a)adpm.de).  This revamps the interface to use a tabbed
  format that allows for many more Nmap options to be used.  It also
  cleans up some crufty parts of the code.  Let me and Peter know what
  you think (and if you encounter any problems).
</li><li>  Windows and Amiga ports now use packet receive times from libpcap.
  Let me know if you get any &quot;time computation problem&quot; errors.
</li><li>  Updated version of the Russian man page translation from Alex Volkov
  (alex(a)cherepovets-city.ru).

<li>  Fixed (I hope) an issue that would cause Nmap to print &quot;Serious time
  computation problem in adjust_timeout ...&quot; and quit.  The ultimate
  cause was demonstrated by this --packet_trace snippet that Russel
  Miller (rmiller(a)duskglow.com) sent me:
  SENT (0.0500s) ICMP 0.0.0.0 &gt; 127.0.0.1 Echo request (type=8/code=0) ...
  RCVD (0.0450s) ICMP 127.0.0.1 &gt; 127.0.0.1 Echo reply (type=0/code=0) ...
  As you can see, the ping reply appears to come BEFORE the request
  was sent(!).  This sort of thing happens on at least Linux and
  Windows.  The send time is obtained from gettimeofday(timeval, NULL),
  while receive time libpcap packet header.  If anyone knows why this
  occurs, or (even better) knows a good way to fix it, let me know.
  For now, I am allowing the response to come up to .05s &quot;before&quot; the
  request.  That is gross.
</li><li>  For years, Nmap has added -I/usr/local/include and -L/usr/local/lib
  to the compiler line to grab local libraries.  I have removed this
  behavior by default, and added a &#39;--with-localdirs&#39; configure option
  that adds it back.  If Nmap fails to compile now without the above
  option, please let me know.  I can change the default back if this
  change causes more problems than it solves.  People (such as certain
  ports tree packagers) who know they don&#39;t want /usr/local should
  specify --without-localdirs rather than relying on that always being
  the default.
</li><li>  Fixed (I hope) a problem that led to the error message &quot;Assertion
  `tqi-&gt;sockets[probe_port_num][seq] == -1&#39; failed&quot;.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem that would cause Nmap on Windows to send ICMP ping
  packets from 0.0.0.0 instead of the appropriate source IP.  Thanks
  to Yeti (boxed(a)blueyonder.co.uk) for the report.
</li><li>  Applied some changes from Solar Designer (solar(a)openwall.com)
  which fix some typos and also suggest safer /tmp/ behavior in the
  HACKING file and Lithuanian man page.  These changes are for the
  Nmap package of his Openwall GNU/*/Linux (Owl) distribution.
  (<a href="http://www.openwall.com/Owl">http://www.openwall.com/Owl</a>/)
</li><li>  For Solaris, I now define NET_SIZE_T to size_t rather than socklen_t
  in nmap.h.  Isn&#39;t that exciting?!!!  Hopefully this will help
  compilation on Solaris 2.6 (and perhaps earlier).  If any Solaris
  users notice new compilation problems, please let me know.  Thanks to
  Al Smith (Al.Smith(a)aeschi.ch.eu.org) for reporting the issue.
</li><li>  Removed an errant getopt() prototype in nbase/getopt.h which should
  hopefully improve compilation on certain Solaris boxes and BSD
  variants.
</li><li>  SCO operating systems are no longer supported due to their recent
  (and absurd) attacks against Linux and IBM.  Bug reports relating to
  UnixWare will be ignored, or possibly even laughed at derisively.
  Note that I have no reason to believe anyone has ever used Nmap on
  SCO systems.  UnixWare and OpenServer suck.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem with small --max_parallelism values when non-root ping
  scanning that would cause Nmap to say &quot;sendconnecttcpquery: Could
  not scavenge a free socket!&quot; and quit.  Problem was reported by
  Justin A (justin(a)bouncybouncy.net) as Debian Bug #195463.
</li><li>  Applied (with a few modifications) a large NmapFE patch from Peter
  Marschall (peter(a)adpm.de).  This patch adds a bunch more scan/ping
  options and cleans up some redundant NmapFE code.
</li><li>  Included new Russian man page translation by Alex Volkov
  (alex(a)cherepovets-city.ru)
</li><li>  Changed many single-quotes (&#39;) into double quotes (&quot;) in the man
  page due to a disagreement over whether to represent them as (&#39;) or
  (\&#39;) in nroff.
</li><li>  Included --packet_trace support for Explicit Congestion Notification
  (RFC 2481/3168) flags thanks to a patch sent in by Maik Pfeil
  (root(a)bundesspionageministerium.de)
</li><li>  Included --packet_trace support for a few (unusual) ICMP types in
  case Nmap receives them.  The patch was also sent by Maik Pfeil.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem with redirecting XML/Grep/Machine output to stdout
  on Windows (e.g. -oX - ).  Problem was reported by Wei Jiang
  (Wei.Jiang(a)bindview.com)
</li><li>  Made &quot;-g -Wall&quot; compiler flags dependent on availability of gcc/g++
  sine some other compilers do not support them.
</li><li>  I spam-protected the email addresses in this file.  I fervently hope
  that within 5 years we will be able to defeat this scourge through
  technology and laws, so that we may again list our email addresses
  openly without fear of abuse by criminal spammers.  Oh, and it would
  be a shame if the spiders went through this whole page and only
  found uce@ftc.gov, rhundt@fcc.gov, jquello@fcc.gov, sness@fcc.gov,
  president@whitehouse.gov, haesslich@loyalty.org, and rchong@fcc.gov.

<li>  Nmap now compiles under Amiga thanks to patches sent by Diego
  Casorran (dcr8520(a)amiga.org).
</li><li>  Fixed a backwards WIN32 ifdef that broke UDP and small-fragment
  scans for some operating systems other than Linux and Windows.
  Thanks to Guido van Rooij (guido(a)gvr.org) for reporting the problem
  and sending a patch.
</li><li>  Applied patch from Marius Strobl (marius(a)alchemy.franken.de) which improves
  the definition of NET_SIZE_T on FreeBSD so that it compiles on
  64-bit platforms.

<li>  Fixed Mac OS X Compilation (at least on most of the machines
  tested).  You will probably need to type
  &quot;./configure CPP=/usr/bin/cpp&quot; instead of simply &quot;./configure&quot;.  If
  you still have trouble, drop me an email.  Thanks to everyone who
  provided or offered shell accounts!
</li><li>  Fixed a segmentation fault several people reported that was
  introduced in 3.25.  This problem manifests itself intermittently
  in many normal situations involving large-network scanning.  So all
  3.25 users are urged to upgrade.  Pre-3.25 users should upgrade too,
  since 3.25 included so many improvements :).
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 3.25 [2003-4-19] <a class="versionlink" id="3.25" href="#3.25" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  I added UDP-based &quot;ping&quot; scanning.  The -PU option can take an
  optional portlist like the TCP &quot;ping&quot; options (-PS, -PA), but it sends
  a UDP packet to the targets and expects hosts that are up to reply
  with a port unreachable (or possibly a UDP response if the port is
  open).  This one is likely to work best against closed ports, since
  many open ports don&#39;t respond to empty requests.
</li><li>  Fixed (I hope) problem where Nmap would abort, complaining that
  &quot;Assertion `pt-&gt;down_this_block &gt; 0&#39; failed&quot;.  Thanks to
  ray(a)24hoursecurity.org and mugz(a)x-mafia.com for reporting and
  helping me debug this problem.
</li><li>  Fixed a GCC dependency reported by Ayamura Kikuchi
  (ayamura(a)keio.net)
</li><li>  Fixed an &quot;assertion failure&quot; which would cause Nmap to exit when you
  specify a --max_rtt_timeout below 3000.  Thanks to Tammy Rathbun
  (rathbun2(a)llnl.gov) and Jan Roger Wilkens (jrw(a)proseq.net) for
  reporting this.
</li><li>  Packet receive times are now obtained from libpcap rather than
  simply using the time the packets are passed to Nmap.  This should
  improve performance slightly.  I was not able to get this to work
  properly on Windows (either pcap or raw) -- join the nmap-dev list
  if you have ideas.
</li><li>  Fixed bug that caused Nmap to ignore certain RST responses when you
  do both -PS and -PA.
</li><li>  Modified ping scan to work better when many instances of Nmap are
  executed concurrently.
</li><li>  I&#39;m now linking directly to the gzip compressed version of Nmap on
  the homepage as well as the .bz2.
</li><li>  Fixed a portability problem that caused BSD Make to bail out.
</li><li>  Fixed a divide by zero error caused when non-root users (on UNIX)
  explicitly request ICMP pings (which require root privileges).  Now it
  prints a warning and uses the normal non-root TCP connect() ping.
  Jaroslav Sladek (jup(a)matfyz.cz) found the bug and provided the patch.
</li><li>  Made Nmap more tolerant of corrupt nmap-services and nmap-protocols
  files thanks to report &amp; patch sent by Phix (phix(a)hush.com)
</li><li>  Added some more port numbers sent in by Seth Master
  (smaster(a)stanford.edu).  He has been a frequent nmap-services
  contributor in the last couple months.
</li><li>  Added --packet_trace support to Windows
</li><li>  Removed superfluous &quot;addport&quot; line in the XML output (patch from Max
  Schubert (nmap(a)webwizarddesign.com)).
</li><li>  Merged wintcpip.cc into tcpip.cc to avoid the headache of
  maintaining many nearly-identical functions.
</li><li>  Fixed an assertion failure crash related to combining port 0 scans
  and OS scan.  Thanks to A.Jones(a)mvv.de for reporting this.
</li><li>  Fixed some compilation problems on systems without IPv6 support --
  patch sent by Jochen Erwied (Jochen.Erwied(a)mbs-software.info)
</li><li>  Applied patch from Jochen Erwied (Jochen.Erwied(a)mbs-software.info)
  which fixes the format strings used for printing certain timestamps.
</li><li>  Upgraded to autoconf 2.57, including the latest config.guess/config.sub
</li><li>  Renamed configure.ac files to configure.in as recommended by the
  latest autoconf documentation.
</li><li>  Changed the wording of NmapFE Gnome entries to better-comply with
  Gnome&#39;s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).  Suggested by Axel Krauth

<li>  The random IP input option (-iR) now takes an argument specifying
  how many IPs you want to scan (e.g. -iR 1000).  Specify 0 for the old
  never-ending scan behavior.
</li><li>  Fixed a tricky memory leak discovered by Mugz (mugz(a)x-mafia.com).
</li><li>  Fixed output truncation problem noted by Lionel CONS (lionel.cons(a)cern.ch)

<li>  Made numerous improvements to the timing behavior of &quot;-T Aggressive&quot;
  (same as -T4) scans.  It is now recommended for regular use by
  impatient people with a fast connection.  &quot;-T Insane&quot; mode has also
  been updated, but we only recommend that for, well, insane people.
</li><li>  Made substantial changes to the SYN/connect()/Window scanning
  algorithms for improved speeds, especially against heavily filtered
  hosts.  If you notice any timing problems (misidentified ports,
  etc.), please send me the details (including full Nmap output and a
  description of what is wrong).  Reports of any timing problems with
  -T4 would be helpful as well.
</li><li>  Changed Nmap such that ALL syn scan packets are sent from the port
  you specify with -g.  Retransmissions used to utilize successively
  higher ports.  This change has a downside in that some operating
  systems (such as Linux) often won&#39;t reply to the retransmissions
  because they reuse the same connection specifier quad
  (srcip:srcport:dstip:dstport).  Overall I think this is a win.
</li><li>  Added timestamps to &quot;Starting nmap&quot; line and each host port scan in
  verbose (-v) mode.  These are in ISO 8601 standard format because
  unlike President Bush, we actually care about International
  consensus :).
</li><li>  Nmap now comes by default in .tar.bz2 format, which compresses about
  20% further.  You can still find .tgz in the dist directory at
  <a href="http://download.insecure.org/nmap/dist/?M">http://download.insecure.org/nmap/dist/?M</a>=D .

<li>  I added support for a brand new &quot;port&quot; that many of you may have
  never scanned before!  UDP &amp; TCP &quot;port 0&quot; (and IP protocol 0) are now
  permitted if you specify 0 explicitly.  An argument like &quot;-p -40&quot;
  would still scan ports 1-40.  Unlike ports, protocol 0 IS now scanned
  by default.  This now works for ping probes too (e.g., -PS, -PA).
</li><li>  Applied patch by Martin Kluge (martin(a)elxsi.info) which adds --ttl
  option, which sets the outgoing IPv4 TTL field in packets sent via
  all raw scan types (including ping scans and OS detection).  The
  patch &quot;should work&quot; on Windows, but hasn&#39;t been tested.  A TTL of 0
  is supported, and even tends to work on a LAN:
<pre>
    14:17:19.474293 192.168.0.42.60214 &gt; 192.168.0.40.135: S 326:326(0) [ttl 0]

</li><li>  Applied patch by Gabriel L. Somlo ( somlo(a)acns.colostate.edu ) which
  extends the multi-ping-port functionality to nonroot and IPv6
  connect() users.
</li><li>  I added a new --datadir command line option which allows you to
  specify the highest priority directory for Nmap data files
  nmap-services, nmap-os-fingerprints, and nmap-rpc.  Any files which
  aren&#39;t in the given dir, will be searched for in the $NMAPDIR
  environmental variable, ~/nmap/, a compiled in data directory
  (e.g. /usr/share/nmap), and finally the current directory.
</li><li>  Fixed Windows (VC++ 6) compilation, thanks to patches from Kevin
  Davis (computerguy(a)cfl.rr.com) and Andy Lutomirski
  (luto(a)stanford.edu)
</li><li>  Included new Latvian man page translation by
  &quot;miscelerious options&quot; (misc(a)inbox.lv)
</li><li>  Fixed Solaris compilation when Sun make is used rather than GNU
  make.  Thanks to Tom Duffy (tduffy(a)sun.com) for assistance.
</li><li>  Applied patch from Stephen Bishop (sbishop(a)idsec.co.uk) which
  prevents certain false-positive responses when Nmap raw TCP ping scans
  are being run in parallel.
</li><li>  To emphasize the highly professional nature of Nmap, I changed all
  instances of &quot;fucked up&quot; in error message text into &quot;b0rked&quot;.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem with nmap-frontend RPMs that would cause a bogus
  /bin/xnmap link to be created (it should only create
  /usr/bin/xnmap).  Thanks to Juho Schultz
  (juho.schultz(a)astro.helsinki.fi) for reporting the problem.
</li><li>  I made the maximum number of allowed routes and interfaces allowed
  on the scanning machine dynamic rather than hardcoded #defines of 1024
  and 128.  You never know -- some wacko probably has that many :).

<li>  Integrated the largest OS fingerprint DB updates ever! Thanks to
  everyone who contributed signatures!  New or substantially modified
  fingerprints included the latest Windows 2K/XP changes, Cisco IOS
  12.2-based routers and PIX 6.3 firewalls, FreeBSD 5.0, AIX 5.1,
  OpenBSD 3.2, Tru64 5.1A, IBM OS/400 V5R1M0, dozens of wireless APs,
  VOIP devices, firewalls, printers, print servers, cable modems,
  webcams, etc.  We&#39;ve even got some mod-chipped Xbox fingerprints
  now!
</li><li>  Applied NetBSD portability patch by Darren Reed
  (darrenr(a)reed.wattle.id.au)
</li><li>  Updated Makefile to better-detect if it can&#39;t make nmapfe and
  provide a clearer error message.  Also fixed a couple compiler
  warnings on some *BSD platforms.
</li><li>  Applied patch from &quot;Max&quot; (nmap(a)webwizarddesign.com) which adds the
  port owner to the &quot;addport&quot; XML output lines which are printed (only
  in verbose mode, I think) as each open port is discovered.
</li><li>  I killed the annoying whitespace that is normally appended after the
  service name.  Now it is only there when an owner was found via -sI
  (in which case there is a fourth column and so &quot;service&quot; must be
  exactly 24 characters).

<li>  Reworked the &quot;ping scan&quot; algorithm (used for any scan except -P0 or
  -sL) to be more robust in the face of low-bandwidth and congested
  connections.  This also improves reliability in the multi-port and
  multi-type ping cases described below.
</li><li>  &quot;Ping types&quot; are no longer exclusive -- you can now do combinations
  such as &quot;-PS22,53,80 -PT113 -PN -PE&quot; in order to increase your odds of
  passing through strict filters.  The &quot;PB&quot; flag is now deprecated
  since you can achieve the same result via &quot;PE&quot; and &quot;PT&quot; options.
</li><li>  Applied patch (with modest changes) by Gabriel L. Somlo
  (somlo(a)acns.colostate.edu), which allows multiple TCP probe ports in
  raw (root) mode.  See the previous item for an example.
</li><li>  Fixed a libpcap compilation issue noted by Josef &#39;Jupp&#39; Schugt
  (deusxmachina(a)webmail.co.za) which relates to the definition (or
  lack thereof) of ARPHRD_HDLC (used for Cisco HDLC frames).

<li>  Upgraded libpcap from version 0.6.2 to 0.7.1.  Updated the
  libpcap-possiblymodified/NMAP_MODIFICATIONS file to give a much
  more extensive list (including diffs) of the changes included
  in the Nmap bundled version of Libpcap.
</li><li>  Applied patch to fix a libpcap alignment bug found by Tom Duffy
  (tduffy(a)sun.com).
</li><li>  Fixed Windows compilation.
</li><li>  Applied patch by Chad Loder (cloder(a)loder.us) of Rapid7 which
  fixes OpenBSD compilation.  I believe Chad is now the official
  OpenBSD Nmap &quot;port&quot; maintainer.  His patch also adjusted
  random-scan (-iR) to include the recently allocated 82.0.0.0/8
  space.
</li><li>  Fixed (I hope) a few compilation problems on
  non-IPv6-enabled machines which were noted by Josef &#39;Jupp&#39;
  Schugt (jupp(a)gmx.de)
</li><li>  Included some man page translations which were inadvertently
  missed in previous tarballs.
</li><li>  Applied patch from Matthieu Verbert (mve(a)zurich.ibm.com) which
  places the Nmap man pages under ${prefix}/share/man rather than
  ${prefix}/man when installed via RPM.  Maybe the tarball
  install should do this too?  Opinions?
</li><li>  Applied patch from R Anderson (listbox(a)pole-position.org) which
  improves the way ICMP port unreachables from intermediate hosts
  are handled during UDP scans.
</li><li>  Added note to man page related to Nmap US export control.  I
  believe Nmap falls under ECCN 5D992, which has no special
  restrictions beyond the standard export denial to a handful of
  rogue nations such as Iraq and North Korea.
</li><li>  Added a warning that some hosts may be skipped and/or repeated
  when someone tries to --resume a --randomize_hosts scan.  This
  was suggested by Crayden Mantelium (crayden(a)sensewave.com)

<li>  Applied patch by Max Schubert (nmap(a)webwizarddesign.com) which adds
  an add-port XML tag whenever a new port is found open when Nmap is
  running in verbose mode.  The new tag looks like:
  &lt;addport state=&quot;open&quot; portid=&quot;22&quot; protocol=&quot;tcp&quot;/&gt;
  I also updated docs/nmap.dtd to recognize this new tag.
</li><li>  Added German translation of Nmap man page by Marc Ruef
  (marc.ruef(a)computec.ch).  It is also available at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/man/de/">https://nmap.org/man/de/</a>

<li>  Added --min_parallelism option, which makes scans more aggressive
  and MUCH faster in certain situations -- especially against
  firewalled hosts.  It is basically the opposite of --max_parallelism
  (-M).  Note that reliability can be lost if you push it too far.
</li><li>  Added --packet_trace option, which tells Nmap to display all of the
  packets it sends and receives in a format similar to tcpdump.  I
  mostly added this for debugging purposes, but people wishing to learn
  how Nmap works or for experts wanting to ensure Nmap is doing
  exactly what they expect.  If you want this feature supported under
  Windows, please send me a patch :).
</li><li>  Fixed a segmentation fault in Idlescan (-sI).
</li><li>  Made Idlescan timing more conservative when -P0 is specified to
  improve accuracy.

  dropped-packet scenarios in an Idle scan.
</li><li>  Nmap now reports execution times to millisecond precision (rather

<li>  IPv6 is now supported for TCP scan (-sT), connect()-style ping
  scan (-sP), and list scan (-sL)!  Just specify the -6 option and the
  IPv6 numbers or DNS names.  Netmask notation is not currently
  supported -- I&#39;m not sure how useful it is for IPv6, where even petty
  end users may be allocated trillions of addresses (/80).  If you
  need one of the scan types that hasn&#39;t been ported yet, give
  Sebastien Peterson&#39;s patch a try at <a href="http://nmap6.sourceforge.net">http://nmap6.sourceforge.net</a>/ .
  If there is demand, I may integrate more of that into Nmap.
</li><li>  Major code restructuring, which included conversion to C++ -- so
  you&#39;ll need g++ or another C++ compiler.  I accidentally let a C++
  requirement slip in a while back and found that almost everyone has
  such a compiler.  Windows (VC++) users: see the README-WIN32 for new
  compilation instructions.
</li><li>  Applied patch from Axel Nennker (Axel.Nennker(a)t-systems.com) which
  adds a --without-nmapfe option to the configure script.  This is
  useful if your system doesn&#39;t have the proper libraries (e.g. GTK) or
  if you think GUIs are for sissies :).
</li><li>  Removed arbitrary max_parallelism (-M) limitations, as suggested by
  William McVey ( wam(a)cisco.com ).
</li><li>  Added DEC OSF to the platforms that require the BSDFIX() macro due
  to taking IP length and offset fields in host rather than network byte

<li>  Fixed major connect scan problem introduced in BETA35
</li><li>  Changed NmapFE to use the version number 2.54BETA36 rather than

  releasing a so-called &quot;2.54BETA31&quot; version of nmap-frontend in their
  7.3 distribution.  Thus my upgrades were failing to install on such

<li>  Added ICMP Timestamp and Netmask ping types (-PP and -PM).  These

  respond to normal ping (-PI) packets.
</li><li>  Documented the --data_length option and made it work with all the
  ICMP ping types (echo request, netmask, and timestamp).

  Nmap could segmentation fault with the (bogus) command: &#39;./nmap -sO

<li>  Added a Document Type Definition (DTD) for the Nmap XML output
  format (-oX) to the docs directory.  This allows validating parsers
  to check nmap XML output files for correctness.  It is also useful
  for application programmers to understand the XML output structure.
  The DTD was written by William McVey (wam(a)cisco.com) of Cisco Secure
  Consulting Services ( <a href="http://www.cisco.com/go/securityconsulting">http://www.cisco.com/go/securityconsulting</a> ).

</li><li>  Fixed byte-order bug in Windows packet matching code which caused
  -PS and -PT to fail.  Bug found and patch sent by Tim Adam.
</li><li>  Fixed segfault problem with &quot;-sU -F&quot;.  Nobody reported this until I
  noticed it :(.  Anytime you see &quot;Segmentation Fault&quot; in the latest
  version of Nmap, it is probably a bug -- please mail me the command
  you used, the OS/platform you are running on, and whether it is
  reproducable.
</li><li>  Added a convenience option &quot;-oA (basefilename)&quot;.  This tells Nmap to
  log in ALL the major formats (normal, grepable, and XML).  You give
  a base for the filename, and the output files will be base.nmap,
  base.gnmap, and base.xml.
</li><li>  Documented the --append_output option which tells Nmap to append
  scan results to any output files you have specified rather than
  overwriting the files.

<li>  Integrated William McVey&#39;s multi-portlist patch.  This allows you to
  specify different port numbers when scanning both TCP &amp; UDP.  For
  example, if you want to UDP for 53,111 and 137 while TCP scanning
  for 21-25,80,139,515,6000,8080 you could do: nmap -sSU -p
  U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,515,6000,8080 target.com .  Prior to
  this patch, you had to either use different Nmap executions or scan
  both UDP &amp; TCP of each port.  See the man page for more usage info.
</li><li>  Added/updated a bunch of fingerprints, including Windows XP release
  candidates #1 &amp; #2, OpenBSD 2.9, various home gateways/cable modem,
  MacOS X 10.0.4, Linux 2.4.7, Guantlet Firewall 4.0a, a few Cisco
  routers, and, most importantly, the Alcatel Advanced Reflexes IP
  Phone :).  Many other fingerprints were updated as well.

  sent in by H D Moore (hdm(a)secureaustin.com), mugz
  (mugz(a)x-mafia.org), and Steven Van Acker (deepstar(a)ulyssis.org)
</li><li>  Applied patch from Chad Loder (chad_loder(a)rapid7.com) which improves
  random target host selection (-iR) by excluding more undesirable
  addresses.
</li><li>  Fixed portscan timing bug found by H D Moore (hdm(a)secureaustin.com).
  This bug can occur when you specify a --max_rtt_timeout but not
  --initial_rtt_timeout and then scan certain firewalled hosts.
</li><li>  Fixed port number printing bug found by &quot;Stephen Leavitt&quot;
  (stephen_j_leavitt(a)hotmail.com)
</li><li>  The Nmap source tarball now extracts with more lenient permissions
  (sometimes world-readable or world-executable, but never
  world-writable).  If you don&#39;t want this, set your umask to 077

  snprintf compatibility file.  This is important for Redhat 7
  systems.
</li><li>  Reorganized output-related routines so that they now reside in
  output.c &amp; output.h.  Let me know if I accidently screwed up the
  behavior of any scan types in the process.

<li>  Revamped the &#39;compatibility libraries&#39; subsystem.  Moved all of that
  to a new library called &#39;libnbase&#39; and changed Nmap and NmapFE to
  use that.  I included a better version of *snprintf and some other
  compatibility files.  Obviously I cannot test these changes on every
  whacked OS that needs this compatibility cruft, so please let me
  know if you run into compilation problems.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem found by Martyn Tovey (martyn(a)netcraft.com) when
  using Nmap on platforms that dislike division by zero.
</li><li>  Removed 128.210.*.* addresses from Nmap man page due to complaints
  from Purdue security staff.

<li>  Upgraded to the very latest Libpcap version ( the 9/3/00 CVS
  snapshot ).  This version is from the tcpdump.org group rather than
  the Lawrence Livermore crew.  The most important advantage is Linux
  Socket Filter support (so you won&#39;t have that annoying syslog
  message about Nmap using the obsolete SOCK_PACKET interface).
</li><li>  I tried to install Nmap on yet another machine without lex/yacc or
  flex/bison.  That was the last straw!  I am now shipping the
  generated C files, which eliminates the lex/yacc requirement.
</li><li>  Applied patch by Jay Freeman (saurik) (saurik(a)saurik.com) to make
  Nmap C++-clean (this was lot of tedious work!  Thanks!).  Note that
  Nmap still uses a normal C compiler by default, but Nmap derivatives
  may appreciate C++ compatibility.  Note that this only applies to
  &quot;Nmap proper&quot;, not libpcap.
</li><li>  Added a HACKING file for people who want to help with Nmap
  development.  It describes preferred patch formats, development
  resources, and offers a number of useful changes that would likely
  be accepted into the main tree.
</li><li>  Fixed a configure.in error found by Vacuum
  (vacuum(a)technotronic.com) which could cause compilation errors.
</li><li>  Fingerprint file adjustments for better Win* detection
</li><li>  Ensure libpcap is not configured and/or installed if you already
  have a &quot;new enough&quot; version (0.4a6+) installed.
</li><li>  Included Italian translation of Nmap man page from Giorgio Zoppi
  (deneb(a)supereva.it) .
</li><li>  Fixed a SYN scan problem that could cause a major slowdown on some
  busy networks.
</li><li>  Fixed a crash problem in NmapFE reported by sverre ( sverre(a)gmx.net )
</li><li>  Added an &quot;SInfo&quot; line to most printed fingerprints.  It looks
  similar to this:
  SInfo(V=2.54BETA4%P=i686-pc-linux-gnu%D=9/4%Time=9681031%O=7%C=1)
  and contains information useful when fingerprints are reported (Nmap
  version/platform, scan date, and open/closed ports used)
</li><li>  Fixed RPCGrind (-sR) scan.  It has been almost completely broken
  since 2.54BETA2 (which has been out for two weeks) and nobody
  reported it!  I noticed the problem myself during testing of
  something else.  I am disappointed that nobody bothered to even let
  me know that this was broken.  Does anyone even use RPC Scan?

<li>  Went through and added/adjusted a bunch of fingerprints.  A lot of
  people submitted Windows Millenium Edition (WinME) beta
  fingerprints, but nobody submitted IPs for them.  So please let me
  know if this version detects your WinME boxes.
</li><li>  Applied NmapFE patch from Michael Fischer v. Mollard (mfvm(a)gmx.de)
  which made did the following:
<ul><li>Added delete event so that NmapFE always quits when you kill it
    with your window manager
</li><li>added the menubar to the vbox instead to the fixed widget</li></ul>

<li>  Added a shortcut which can make single port SYN scans of a network
  much faster.  For example, if a new sendmail vulnerability is found,
  this reduces the time it takes to scan your whole network for port
  25.  This shortcut takes effect when you do &quot;-PS[port] -sS
  -p[port]&quot;.  For example &#39;nmap -n -sS -p25 -PS25 24.0.0.0/8&quot;.  This
  optimization doubled the scan speed in a 30,000 IP test I performed.
</li><li>  Added -sL (List scan).  Just as ping scan (-sP) allows you to short
  circuit the scan right after pinging, -sL allows you to short
  circuit the scan right after target selection.  This allows you to
  see what hosts WOULD be scanned without actually doing it.  The
  hosts will be resolved unles you use -n.  Primary uses:
<ul><li>Get all the IPs in a network (like A.B.C.D/16) and take out
     machines that are too fragile to be scanned safely before
     calling Nmap with the new list (using -iL).
</li><li>Test that a complex spec like 128.4,5,7-9.*.7 does what you
     expect before actual scanning.
</li><li>When all you want to do is resolve a bunch of IPs.
</li><li>You just want results of a zone transfer (if it is implemented).</li></ul>

</li><li>  Added some new fingerprints and adjusted some others based on
  submissions to the DB (I still have a lot more to go through so
  don&#39;t worry if your submission is still not detected).
</li><li>  Added a warning when you scan 0 hosts (eg &quot;nmap -v&quot;).  There are
  various other output tweaks as well.
</li><li>  Ensured that 0.0.0.0 can be scanned by nmap (although on some OSs,
  like Linux, it won&#39;t work due to what seem to be kernel bugs).  Oh
  well.  I&#39;ll look into it later.

<li>  Added an extremely cool scan type by Gerhard Rieger ( rieger at
  iue.tuwien.ac.at ) -- IP Protocol scanning.  Basically it sends a
  bunch of IP headers (no data) with different &quot;protocol&quot; fields to
  the host.  The host then (usually) sends back a protocol unreachable
  for those that it does not support.  By exclusion, nmap can make a
  list of those that are supported.  This is similar in concept to
  (and is implemented using most of the same scanning routines as) UDP
  scanning.  Note that some hosts do not send back protocol
  unreachables -- in that case all protocols will appear &quot;open&quot;.
</li><li>  Fixed an uninitialized variable problem in NmapFE (found by Alvin
  Starr (alvin at iplink.net )
</li><li>  Fixed a packaging problem that lead to the Nmap man page being
  included twice in the .tgz .
</li><li>  Fixed dangling nroff include in xnmap man page (noted by Debian Nmap

</li><li>  Added a bunch of OS fingerprints based on all the contributions in

  -v was specified.  Here is an example of the format:
  # Ports scanned: TCP(13;1-10,22,25) UDP(0;)
  The &quot;13&quot; above is the number of TCP ports being scanned.
</li><li>  Got rid of a snprintf() from nmapfe sine some systems don&#39;t have it

  ( peter.marschall at mayn.de )
</li><li>  Applied patch to services.c by Andrew Brown (atatat(a)atatdot.net)
  which prevents some useless debugging (-d) output when reading some
  kindss of /etc/services files.
</li><li>  Added &quot;Host: [machinename] (ip) Status: Down&quot; to machine logs when
  the verbose option is given (just like down hosts are reported to
  stdout when verbose is given).  Suggested by Alek Komarnitsky.
</li><li>  Applied NetBSD compatibility patch provided by Mipam (reinoud at
  ibbnet.org) which changes an autoconf macro to check for
  getopt_long_only instead of getopt_long.
</li><li>  Nmap used to print an inaccuracy warning when no open TCP ports were
  found on the target machine.  Due to a bug, this was not always
  being printed.  Problem found by Matt (matt at use.net) and Ajay
  Gupta2 (Ajay.Gupta2 at ey.com).
</li><li>  Added the number of ports in the ignored state right after the state
  name in machine parseable logs.  It used to looke like: &quot;Ignored
  State: closed&quot; whereas now it looks like: &quot;Ignored State: closed
  (1508)&quot; Meaning that 1508 ports were closed and thus are not
  specifically enumerated.

<li>  Tweaked the output so that it now tells how many ports are not shown
  and what state the ignored ports are in.  This info could be
  inferred before by people who had studied the manpage, but now the
  info is explicitly available.  I cleaned up a bunch of stuff
  internally to make this happen.  I hope I didn&#39;t break anything!
</li><li>  Changed NmapFE so that it always kills any running Nmap process when
  you press exit. Problem noted by Marc Renner
  (mrenner(a)ci.marysville.wa.us)
</li><li>  Apparently some Linux (glibc) systems now come with a &quot;strcasestr&quot;
  function.  So I have made autoconf look for this and use the native
  version if supported (problem noted by Sami Farin
  (sfarin(a)ratol.fi)).
</li><li>  Added a new attribute &quot;Ignored State: xxx&quot; to the machine parseable
  logs, where xxx is the state (closed, filtered, or UNfiltered) that
  is being ignored.  Ports in that state are not listed (they weren&#39;t
  listed in earlier versions either).  Perhaps I should list ALL ports
  for machine parseable output.  Opinions?
</li><li>  Merged in a patch sent in by Mipam (reinoud(a)ibbnet.org) which is
  apparently part of the OpenBSD Nmap &quot;port&quot;.  Although Nmap seems to
  work fine for me on my OpenBSD 2.4 box, a couple OpenBSD users have
  complained of problems.  Hopefully this will help (it adds DLT_LOOP
  and DLT_ENC offset cases when reading from libpcap).

<li>  Fixed a very important bug that occurred when SYN scanning
  localhost.  Many thanks to Dries Schellekens (
  gwyllion(a)ace.ulyssis.student.kuleuven.ac.be ) for first reporting
  the problem.
</li><li>  Uros Prestor from TurboLinux informed us that the latest versions of
  Nmap work with Linux on the upcoming Intel Merced/Itanium IA-64
  processors.  He also said that the TurboLinux distribution includes
  Nmap.  Kudos to them!  As well as the other distros that support
  Nmap (Debian, Red Hat, Suse, Trinux) and of course FreeBSD, NetBSD,
  &amp; OpenBSD.  Does anyone know if Nmap ships with the latest from
  Mandrake or Corel?  The latest Solaris includes some Free software.
  If anyone can get them to ship Nmap, I will buy you a case of beer
  :).
</li><li>  Added a #define to change vsnprintf to vsprintf on machines which do
  not support the former (mostly Solaris 2.5.1 and earlier).  This
  function is less safe.  For people who care about security, we
  recommend an upgrade to Solaris 8 (or Linux/*BSD).
</li><li>  Changed the NmapFE version to 0.[nmap_version] rather than always
  leaving it at 0.9.5 (which was confusing).  Thanks to J.D.K. Chipps
  (jdkc(a)woptura.com) for noticing this.
</li><li>  Added support for &quot;-vv&quot; (means the same as &quot;-v -v&quot;).  Older versions
  of Nmap supported it (noted by George Kurtz).

<li>  Added ACK scanning.  This scan technique (which van Houser and
  others have been bugging me to add for years :), is great for
  testing firewall rulesets.  It can NOT find open ports, but it can
  distinguish between filtered/unfilterd by sending an ACK packet to
  each port and waiting for a RST to come back.  Filtered ports will
  not send back a RST (or will send ICMP unreachables).  This scan
  type is activated with -sA .
</li><li>  Documented the Window scan (-sW) which Lamont Granquist added in
  September 99.
</li><li>  Added a whole bunch of OS fingerprints that people have submitted.
</li><li>  &quot;Protocol&quot; field in output eliminated.  It is now printed right next
  to the number (/etc/services style).  Like &quot;22/tcp&quot;.  I wonder what
  I should put in the extra white space this leaves on the report :).
</li><li>  Added --resume option to continue a large network scan where you
  left off.  This is useful for recovering from errors (modem drops
  carrier, network outage, etc).  It also allows you to start and stop
  for policy reasons (like if a client only wants you to scan on
  weekends or at night) or if you want to run the scan on a different
  host.  Usage is &#39;nmap --resume logfile&#39; where logfile can be either
  normal (-oN) or machine parseable (-oM) logfile from the scan that
  was aborted.  No other options can be given (the options in the
  logfile from the original scan will be used).  Nmap will start off
  with the host after the last one successfully scanned in the log
  file.
</li><li>  Added --append_output option which causes -oN/-oM/-oS to APPEND to
  the output file you specify rather than overwriting it.
</li><li>  Various internal code cleanup, makefile fixes, etc.
</li><li>  Changed version number from 2.3BETA* to 2.30BETA* to appease various
  packaging systems that thought 2.3BETA was &lt; 2.12 .
</li><li>  Nmap output to files now correctly flushes output after scanning for
  each host is finished.
</li><li>  Fixed compiler -L flags error found by Ralf Hildebrandt
  (R.Hildebrandt(a)tu-bs.de)
</li><li>  Fixed configure scripts so that options you give to the Nmap
  configure (like --prefix ) are also passed to the nmapfe configure
  script.  This problem was noted by Ralf Hildebrandt
  (R.Hildebrandt(a)tu-bs.de).  While I was at it, I added some other
  cleanups to the system.
</li><li>  Added --noninteractive option for when nmap is called from scripts
  (where stuff like prompting users for info is unacceptable).  It
  does not currently do anything (Nmap never prompts) and script
  writers should probably wait until at least May &#39;2000 so their
  scripts still work with earlier versions of Nmap.
</li><li>  Updated to the latest config.guess and config.sub from Autoconf 2.13
</li><li>  Applied patch by Sven (s.carstens(a)gmx.de&gt; which fixes a
  segmentation fault problem in Nmapfe colored mode as well as some

<li>  Peter Kosinar (goober(a)gjh.sk) performed some cleanup of the output

  it out by adding &quot;-oS - &quot; to your nmap command line.  Note that
  using &#39;-&#39; to represent stdout instead of a filename is something you
  can do with any of the output modes.

  attempt finds it to be closed (problem noticed by Matt

  shuffling more random.
</li><li>  Various minor changes and internal code cleanup.

<li>  Added interactive mode which adds convenience for managing nmap

</li><li>  Added/modified many fingerprints including the latest 2.3.X Linux
  releases, the latest Win2000 builds, the Apple Airport Wireless
  device, and several dozen more.
</li><li>  Migrated to RPM .spec file sent in by Tim Powers
  (timp(a)redhat.com).  That is the file they will be using to package
  Nmap with the power tools CD in the next Redhat release.  The most
  important changes are that Nmap (only the RPM version) now installs
  in /usr/* instead of /usr/local/* and the frontend is now
  dynamically linked with GTK and comes in a separate rpm.
</li><li>  The -i (input from list) option has been deprecated.  From now on
  you should use -iL [filename] to read from a list or -iR to have
  Nmap generate random IPs to scan.  This -iR option is new.
</li><li>  The -o and -m options have been deprecated.  From now on, you should
  use -oN for normal (human readable) output and -oM for machine
  parseable output.  At some point I might add -oH (HTML output) or
  -oSK (sKr|pt kiDdi3 0uTPut).
</li><li>  Added --randomize_hosts option, which causes hosts be be scanned in
  non-sequential order.  This makes scans less conspicuous.  For
  efficiency reasons, the hosts are chopped into groups of 2048 and
  then each group is internally shuffled (the groups still go in
  order).
</li><li>  Rearranged the help (&#39;nmap -h&#39; or &#39;nmap&#39; or &#39;nmap --help&#39;) screen to
  be shorter (37 -&gt; 23 lines!) and include some of the new features of
  this release.  The man page was updated as well.
</li><li>  Fixed longstanding bug where nmap -sS mylocalnetwork/24 would not
  successfully scan the host running nmap.
</li><li>  Internal improvements to make scanning faster with -i (input list)
  or when you specify multiple machines on the command line.
</li><li>  Uses faster GCD algorithm and fixed several typos (sent in by Peter
  Kosinar).
</li><li>  Provide more information in machine/human readable output files
  (start time, end time, RPC program name, Nmap version number)
</li><li>  Killed the -A option (if you don&#39;t know what that is then you won&#39;t
  miss it.  In fact, even if you do know what it is you won&#39;t miss
  it.)

<li>  Added about 70 new OS fingerprints so that Nmap can detect more
  systems.  The most important new fingerprints are probably:
<ul><li>The new SP5+ NT boxes -- After all these years MS FINALLY made
    sequence prediction harder (on NT anyway).
</li><li>Solaris 8 Pre-Release
</li><li>Sega Dreamcast (Hack that!)
</li><li>Latest Windows 2000 builds
</li><li>OpenBSD 2.6</li></ul>

<li>  Applied patch by Mark Abene (Phiber Optik) to fix several type
  length issues so that it works on Linux/Alpha.
</li><li>  Applied patch by Matthieu Verbert (mve(a)zurich.ibm.com) to speed up OSScan
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.3BETA8 [1999-11-21] <a class="versionlink" id="2.3BETA8" href="#2.3BETA8" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Added &quot;firewall mode&quot; timing optimizations which can decrease the
  ammount of time neccessary to SYN or connect scan some heavily
  filtered hosts.
</li><li>  Added min_rtt_timeout timing option (see man page for details)
</li><li>  Changed &quot;TCP Ping&quot; to use a random ACK value rather than 0 (an IDS
  called Snort was using this to detect Nmap TCP Pings).
</li><li>  Some changes for better Alpha/Linux support based on investigation
  by Bill Beers (wbeers(a)carolina.rr.com)
</li><li>  Applied changes for FDDI support by Tobias J. Nijweide (tobias(a)mesa.nl)
</li><li>  Applied a socket binding patch from LaMont Jones
  (lamont(a)security.hp.com) which can be useful when using -S to
  specify one of multiple interfaces on a machine.
</li><li>  Made OS detection smart enough to first check scan results for a
  known closed port instead of immediately resorting to a random one.
  This improves OS detection against some machines behind packet
  filters (suggested by van Hauser).
</li><li>  Applied a shortcut suggestion by Thomas Reinke which can lead to a
  tremendous speedup against some firewalled hosts.
</li><li>  Added some ports commonly used for RPC to nmap-services
</li><li>  Fixed a problem with the timing of an RPC scan (could come before
  the UDP scans they rely on)
</li><li>  Added a number of new ports to nmap-services
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.3BETA6 [1999-09-19] <a class="versionlink" id="2.3BETA6" href="#2.3BETA6" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Added sophisticated timing controls to give the user much more
  control over Nmap&#39;s speed.  This allows you to make Nmap much more
  aggressive to scan hosts faster, or you can make Nmap more &quot;polite&quot;
  -- slower but less likely to wreak havoc on your Network.  You can
  even enforce large delays between sending packets to sneak under IDS
  thresholds and prevent detection.  See the new &quot;Timing Options&quot;
  section of the Nmap man page for more information on using this.
</li><li>  Applied Lamont Granquist&#39;s (lamontg(a)u.washington.edu) Window scan
  patch (I changed the name from ACK scan to Window scan since I may
  add another scan that uses ACK packets and I don&#39;t want them to be
  confused).  -sW activates this scan type.  It is mostly effective
  against BSD, AIX, Digital UNIX, and various older HP/UX, SunOS, and
  VAX (See nmap-hackers mailing list archives for an extensive list).
</li><li>  Added various long options people expect to see like --version ,
  --help , --usage , etc.  Some of the new timing options are also long.
  I had to add getopt_long C files since most non-Linux boxes don&#39;t
  support getopt_long in libc.
</li><li>  Human readable (-o) output changed to include the time/date of the
  scan.  Suggested by van Hauser.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.3BETA5 [1999-09-07] <a class="versionlink" id="2.3BETA5" href="#2.3BETA5" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Changed RPC output based on suggestions by David O&#39;Brien
  (obrien(a)NUXI.com) and Lance Spitzner (lance(a)spitzner.net).  I
  got rid of the &quot;(Non-RPC)&quot; unnecessary clutter which appeared after
  each non RPC port and the &quot;(untested)&quot; that appeard after each
  &quot;filtered&quot; port.
</li><li>  Added a ton of new OS fingerprints people submitted.  I had about
  400 in my inbox.  Of course, almost 100 of them were submissions for
  www.windows2000test.com :).
</li><li>  Changed the machine parseable output of RPC information to include
  the version information.  If we figured out the RPC info, it is now
  provided as &quot;program-num*lowversion-highversion&quot;.  If we didn&#39;t get
  the number, but we think the port is RPC, the field simply contains
  &quot;R&quot;.  If we believe the port is NOT RPC, then the field contains
  &quot;N&quot;.  If the field is empty, we did not RPC scan the port.  Thanks
  to H D Moore (nlog(a)ings.com) for making me aware how much the
  earlier machine parseable RPC logging sucked :).
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.3BETA4 [1999-08-30] <a class="versionlink" id="2.3BETA4" href="#2.3BETA4" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Added direct (non-portmapper) RPC scanning to determine what RPC
  program is listening on a particular port.  This works for UDP and
  TCP ports and is currently implemented using sockets (which means
  you can&#39;t use decoys, but on the other hand you don&#39;t have to be
  root).  Thanks go to ga (ga(a)capyork.com) for writing sample code
  to demonstrate the technique.  The RPC services list included with
  nmap was compiled by Vik Bajaj (vbajaj(a)sas.upenn.edu) with help
  from various members of the nmap-hackers list.
</li><li>  Fixed a problem that could cause freezes when you scan machines on
  at least two different types of interfaces as part of the same
  command.
</li><li>  Identified and found workaround for Linux kernel bug which allows
  connect() to sometimes succeed inapropriately when scanning closed
  ports on localhost.
</li><li>  Fixed problems relating to people who specify the same port more
  than once on the command line.  While the right answer is &quot;well,
  don&#39;t do that!&quot;, I decided to fix nmap to handle this gracefully.
</li><li>  Tweaked UDP scanning to be more effective against Solaris ICMP error
  limiting.
</li><li>  Fixed strtol() integer overflow problem found by Renaud Deraison
  (deraison(a)cvs.nessus.org)
</li><li>  The HTML translation of the Man page at
  <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man.html">https://nmap.org/book/man.html</a> should now be
  complete (man2html was dropping lines before).
</li><li>  Added a note in the man page that Nmap 2.0+ is believed to be
  COMPLETELY Y2K COMPLIANT!  I&#39;ve been getting a lot of letters from
  laywers about that recently.  You should still be able to port scan
  on Jan 1st (well ... as long as you have electricity and gangs of
  looting thugs haven&#39;t stolen your computers :)

<li>  Integrated nmapfe code from Zach Smith to allow the nmapfe output
  window to resize when you resize the nmapfe window.
</li><li>  Integrated patch sent in by Stefan Erben (stefan(a)erben.com) which
  allows nmap to recognize and ignore null interfaces.  If you were
  getting a bogus error like &quot;eth0 not found in /proc/net/route&quot; then
  this should solve your problem.
</li><li>  Applied patch from Alexander Savelyev (fano(a)ham.kiev.ua) which
  gives nmap the parameters necessary to support SLIP and PPP on BSDI
  systems.
</li><li>  Upgraded to a new version of shtool (1.2.3)
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.2-Beta3 [1999-05-02] <a class="versionlink" id="2.2-Beta3" href="#2.2-Beta3" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Adopted Ralf S. Engelschall&#39;s excellent shtool script for
  simplifying the nmap makefile and making it more portable
</li><li>  Various other minor changes to nmapfe.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.2-Beta2 <a class="versionlink" id="2.2-Beta2" href="#2.2-Beta2" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Cleaned up build environment more, fixed up RPM and Makefile.in,
  eliminated the automake stuff.
</li><li>  Added nmapfe feature to show nmap command as you change options
</li><li>  Changed nmapfe to use a global MyWidgets struct rather than tons of
  global vars all over the place.
</li><li>  Made nmapfe much smarter about rejecting stupid option attempts.  It
  now tries to correct things when you specify illegal options.
</li><li>  GTK+ 1.0 compatibility fixes
</li><li>  Integrated nmapfe changes from Zach
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.2-BETA1 <a class="versionlink" id="2.2-BETA1" href="#2.2-BETA1" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">

</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.12 [1999-04-04] <a class="versionlink" id="2.12" href="#2.12" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Changed the way tcp connect() scan determines the results of a
  connect() call.  Hopefully this will make nmap a little more
  portable.
</li><li>  Got rid of the security warning message for people who are missing
  /dev/random and /dev/urandom due to complaints about the warning.
  This only silences the warnings -- it still uses relatively weak
  random number generation under Solaris and other systems that lack
  this functionality.
</li><li>  Eliminated pow() calls on Linux boxes.  I think some sort of glibc
  bug was causing nmap to sigsegv in some cases inside of pow().  Most
  people weren&#39;t affected, but those who were would almost always
  SIGSEGV with -O.
</li><li>  Fixed an rpm problem noted by Mark Smith (marks(a)senet.com.au)
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.11 [1999-04-03] <a class="versionlink" id="2.11" href="#2.11" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Many new fingerprints added.  I received more than 300 submissions
  between this release and the last one.
</li><li>  Fixed IRIX problems which prevented OS scanning from working on that
  platform.  The problem was researched and solution found by Lamont
  Granquist (lamontg(a)u.washington.edu).  You can also thank him for
  porting nmap to almost every UNIX around.
</li><li>  Added support for &#39;-m -&#39; to redirect machine readable logs to stdout
  for shell pipelining, etc.  I also changed machine readable output
  to show service names now that we use a nmap specific services file
  rather than /etc/services.  These features were suggested by Dan
  Farmer.  You can also thank him for SATAN (the auditing tool).
</li><li>  Fixed a link-list bug that could cause hangs in UDP,FIN,NULL, and
  XMAS scans.  Also fixed a ptr problem that could cause SIGSEGV.
  These problem were discovered and tracked down by Ben Laurie
  (ben(a)algroup.co.uk).  You can also thank him for Apache, OpenSSL,
  and Apache-SSL.
</li><li>  Fixed installation problem for people without a /usr/local/man/man1
  directory.  Found by Jeffrey Robertson (a-jeffro(a)microsoft.com).
  I guess you can thank him for Win98 ;).
</li><li>  Several other little fixes to the installation script and minor
  scanner tweaks.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.10 <a class="versionlink" id="2.10" href="#2.10" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">

<li>  Bugfix for problem that can cause nmap to appear to &quot;freeze up&quot; for
  long periods of time when run on some busy networks (found by
  Lamont Granquist).
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.07 [1999-02-08] <a class="versionlink" id="2.07" href="#2.07" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Fixed a lockup on Solaris (and perhaps other proprietary UNIX
  systems) caused by a lack of /dev/random &amp; /dev/urandom and a rand()
  that only returns values up to 65535.  Users of Free operating
  systems like Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD probably shouldn&#39;t bother
  upgrading.
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.06 [1999-02-08] <a class="versionlink" id="2.06" href="#2.06" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Fixed compile problems on machines which lack snprintf() (found by
  Ken Williams (jkwilli2(a)unity.ncsu.edu))
</li><li>  Added the squid proxy to nmap-services (suggested by Holger Heimann)
</li><li>  Fixed a problem where the new memory allocation system was handing
  out misaligned pointers.
</li><li>  Fixed another memory allocation bug which probably doesn&#39;t cause any
  real-life problems.
</li><li>  Made nmap look in more places for nmap-os-fingerprints
</li></ul><h3 class="nmap-version">Nmap 2.05 [1999-02-08] <a class="versionlink" id="2.05" href="#2.05" title="Permalink to this version">&#167;</a></h3><ul class="changes">
<li>  Tons of new fingerprints.  The number has grown by more than 25%.
  In particular, Charles M. Hannum (root(a)ihack.net) fixed several
  problems with NetBSD that made it easy to fingerprint and he sent me
  a huge new batch of fingerprints for various NetBSD releases down to
  1.2.  Other people sent NetBSD fingerprints down to 1.0.  I finally
  got some early Linux fingerprints in (down to 1.09).
</li><li>  Nmap now comes with its own nmap-services which I created by merging
  the /etc/services from a bunch of OS&#39; and then adding Netbus, Back
  Orifice, etc.
</li><li>  Random number generation now takes advantage of the /dev/urandom or
  /dev/random that most Free operating systems offer.
</li><li>  Increased the maximum number of OS guesses nmap will make, told nmap
  never to give you two matches where the OS names are byte-to-byte
  equivalent.  Fixed nmap to differentiate between &quot;no OS matches
  found&quot; and &quot;too many OS matches to list&quot;.
</li><li>  Fixed an information leak in the packet TTL values (found by HD
  Moore (hdmoore(a)usa.net))
</li><li>  Fixed the problem noted by Savva Uspensky about offsets used for
  various operating systems&#39; PPP/SLIP headers.  Due to lack of
  responses regarding other operating systems, I have made assumptions
  about what works for BSDI, NetBSD, and SOLARIS.  If this version no
  longer works on your modem, please let me know (and tell me whether
  you are using SLIP/PPP and what OS you are running).
</li><li>  Machine parseable logs are now more machine parseable (I now use a
  tab to seperate test result fields rather than the more ambiguous
  spaces.  This may break a few things which rely on the old format.
  Sorry.  They should be easy to fix.
</li><li>  Added my nmap-fingerprintinting-article.txt to the distribution in
  the docs directory.
</li><li>  Fixed problem where nmap -sS (my_ethernet_or_ppp_ip_address) would
  not correctly scan localhost (due to the kernel rerouting the
  traffic through localhost).  Nmap should now detect and work around
  this behavior.
</li><li>  Applied patch sent to my by Bill Fenner (fenner(a)parc.xerox.com)
  which fixes various SunOS compatibility problems.
</li><li>  Changed the makefile &#39;all&#39; target to use install-sh rather than
  mkdir -p (doesn&#39;t work on some systems)
</li><li>  Documentation updated and clarified slightly.
</li><li>  Added this CHANGELOG file to the distribution.

<A NAME="intro"></A>
<h1 class="purpleheader">Introduction</h1>

<BR>

<P>Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source
(<a href="/data/COPYING">license</a>) utility for
network discovery and security auditing.  Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime.  Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.  It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts.  Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X.  In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
(<a href="/zenmap/">Zenmap</a>), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
(<a href="/ncat/">Ncat</a>), a utility for
comparing scan results (<a href="/ndiff/">Ndiff</a>), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (<a href="/nping/">Nping</a>).

<P>Nmap was named &ldquo;Security Product of the Year&rdquo; by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest.  It
was even featured in <a href="/movies/">twelve
movies</a>, including
<a href="/movies/#matrix">The Matrix Reloaded</a>,
<a href="/movies/#diehard4">Die Hard 4</a>,
<a href="/movies/#gwtdt">Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>,
 and
<a href="/movies/#bourne">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>.


<P>Nmap is ...

<span style="display:none" property="name">Nmap</span>
<span style="display:none" property="applicationCategory">Security</span>
<span style="display:none" property="applicationSubCategory">Port Scanner</span>
<LI><B>Flexible</B>: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
other obstacles.  This includes many <A
HREF="/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html">port scanning</A> mechanisms (both TCP &amp;
UDP), <A HREF="/book/osdetect.html">OS
detection</A>, <A HREF="/book/vscan.html">version detection</A>, ping sweeps, and more. See the <A
HREF="/docs.html">documentation page</a>.

<LI><B>Powerful</B>: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
literally hundreds of thousands of machines.

<LI><B>Portable</B>: Most operating systems are supported, including
<span property="operatingSystem">Linux</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Microsoft Windows</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">FreeBSD</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">OpenBSD</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Solaris</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">IRIX</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Mac OS X</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">HP-UX</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">NetBSD</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Sun OS</span>,
<span property="operatingSystem">Amiga</span>,
and more.

<LI><B>Easy</B>: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap&nbsp;-v&nbsp;-A&nbsp;<I>targethost</I>".  Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
versions are available to suit your preference.  Binaries are
available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.

<LI><B>Free</B>: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
the Internet a little more secure and to provide
administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
their networks.  Nmap is available for <A
HREF="https://nmap.org/download.html" property="downloadUrl">free download</A>, and also comes with full
source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
the <a href="data/COPYING" property="license">license</a>.

<LI><B>Well Documented</B>: Significant effort has been put into
comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
even a whole book!  Find them in multiple
languages <A HREF="/docs.html">here</A>.

<LI><B>Supported</B>: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users.  Most of this interaction occurs on the <A
HREF="#lists">Nmap mailing lists</A>.  Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the <a href="https://seclists.org/nmap-dev">nmap-dev list</a>, but only after you read the <a href="/book/man-bugs.html">guidelines</a>.  We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic <a href="https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers">nmap-hackers</a> announcement list. You can also find Nmap on <a href="http://facebook.com/nmap">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nmap">Twitter</a>. For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> or <a href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFNet</a>.

<LI><B>Acclaimed</B>: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
<span propery="award">"Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal</span>, Info
World and Codetalker Digest.  It has been featured in hundreds of
magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
series.  Visit the <A HREF="nmap_inthenews.html">press page</A>
for further details.

<LI><B>Popular</B>: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc).  It is among the top ten (out of
30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository.  This is important
because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
communities.

<h1 class="purpleheader">Communication</h1>

<P>Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the <I>Nmap-hackers</I>
mailing list.  It is a low volume (8 posts in 2016), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects.  You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

<P><center>
<FORM Method=POST ACTION="https://nmap.org/mailman/subscribe/announce">
<INPUT type="Text" name="email" size="25" value="">
<font color="#000000"><INPUT type="Submit" name="email-button" value="Subscribe to Nmap-hackers"></font><BR>
(or subscribe with custom options from the <a href="https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">Nmap-hackers list info page</a>)
</FORM>
</center>

<P>We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc.  New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes.  You can subscribe at the <a
href="https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev">Nmap-dev list
info page</a>.

<P>Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at <A HREF="https://seclists.org">Seclists.org</A>.

<P>Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> (irc.freenode.net).

<h2 class="purpleheader">Nmap Network Scanning</h2>

<BR>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20"><img width=326 height=200 src="https://nmap.org/book/cover/nns-whole-cover-326x200.jpg" align=right></a>
Nmap Network Scanning is the official guide to the Nmap Security
Scanner, a free and open source utility used by millions of people for
network discovery, administration, and security auditing. From
explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing low-level
packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits all
levels of security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference
guide documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the
book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve
real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on
the wire.

<p>Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks
with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided
for common uses such as taking network inventory, penetration testing,
detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks. Nmap runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

<p>Nmap's original author, Gordon &ldquo;Fyodor&rdquo; Lyon, wrote
this book to share everything he has learned about network scanning
during more than a decade of Nmap development.  It was briefly the #1
selling computer book on Amazon
(<a href="https://nmap.org/book/img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png">screenshot</a>).  The book is in English, though <a href="#translations">several translations</a> are in the works.

<p>Key facts: The ISBN is 978-0-9799587-1-7 (ISBN-10 is 0-9799587-1-7)
and suggested retail prices are $49.95 in the U.S., &pound;34.95 in
the U.K., and &euro;39.95 in Europe.  Like most books, it costs less
online (as little as $32.97 - see <a href="#purchase">purchasing
options</a>).  It is 468 pages long.  The official release date was
January 1, 2009, though Amazon managed to beat that by a couple weeks.

<p>About half of the content is <a href="toc.html">available in the
free online edition</a>.  Chapters exclusive to the print edition
include &ldquo;Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion
Detection Systems&rdquo;, &ldquo;Optimizing Nmap Performance&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Port Scanning Techniques and Algorithms&rdquo;, &ldquo;Host
Discovery (Ping Scanning)&rdquo;, and more.
The <em>solution</em> selections which provide detailed
instructions on the best way to solve common networking tasks are also
exclusive to the printed book.  The
<a href="toc.pdf">final table of contents</a> and <a href="cover/">cover art</a> are available.

</ul>

<A NAME="updates"></A>
<h2 class="purpleheader">Updates</h2>

<P>Several people asked whether Nmap Network Scanning
is still up to date, particularly after the release of <a href="https://nmap.org/5/">Nmap 5.00</a>.  The good news is that virtually all of the
content remains accurate.  But we have added some new features and
NSE scripts which aren't yet documented in NNS.

<P>For a comprehensive and completely current view of Nmap, I
recommend reading Nmap Network Scanning first, then read all the
changelog entries we've produced since the book was finished.  The
book is completely up-to-date with Nmap 4.76.  So after (or before)
you're done reading Nmap Network Scanning, visit
the <a href="https://nmap.org/changelog.html">Nmap changelog</a> and search
in the file for &ldquo;Nmap 4.76&rdquo;.  Read each item upward from there
(scrolling backward) until you get to the top.
<br><br>

<A NAME="translations"></A>
<h2 class="purpleheader">Translations</h2>

<p>We would love to make the Nmap book more accessible by working with foreign publishers who will translate and distribute it in their markets.  If you are such a publisher or know a good one to suggest, please <a href="mailto:fyodor@nmap.org">let me know</a>.  Here are the current or in-progress translations:

<p><b>December 31, 2008:</b> NNS makes Richard Bejtlich's TaoSecurity <a href="http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html">Top Books of 2008</a> list.
<p><b>December 29, 2008:</b> A new <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/12/nmap_network_sc.html">Information Week review</a> is one of the best so far!

<p><b>December 19, 2008:</b> The book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20">back in stock on Amazon</a> after a 10 day dry spell!

<p><b>December 10, 2008:</b> Amazon has now indexed this book as part of
their &ldquo;Search Inside&rdquo; program.  While Amazon intends this
as a marketing tool for prospective buyers, it can be even more useful
for folks who already own the book. While we're proud of our index,
Search Inside can help find more obscure terms or combinations of them.  You can try this out by visiting
the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20">Amazon
NNS page</a>, scrolling down to the Search Inside box, and typing in a
term such as Trinity or Microsoft.

<p><b>December 9, 2008:</b> Sales were so high that Amazon ran out of stock in the US, UK, and Germany.  They say it may take a week or more to ship.  Amazon still offers a great price, but for those who can't wait, I've added a <a href="#purchase">purchasing options</a> section. It includes vendor such as A1Books and Barnes &amp; Noble with NNS in stock now.

<p><b>December 9, 2008:</b> Nmap Network Scanning sales surge further to become #1 on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2&amp;tag=secbks-20">Amazon's computer book best seller list</a>!  Since we can't keep that rank forever, I took a <a href="img/nns-top-seller-471x512.png">screenshot</a> (<a href="img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png">larger version</a>).

<p><b>December 8, 2008:</b>
An <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/12/08/1443223.shtml">excellent
Slashdot review</a> causes NNS to rocket into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2&amp;tag=secbks-20">Amazon's top 10 computer books</a>.

<p><b>December 6, 2008:</b> Amazon has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20">fixed the price</a> so it is now $33.71 rather than $49.95.  NNS is <b>in stock and shipping</b>!

<p><b>December 2, 2008:</b> The book has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20">an initial page on Amazon</a>.  You can pre-order it now, but Amazon is showing a pre-order price of $49.95.  I expect the price to be about $33 when Amazon starts shipping it within a week or two.  Amazon will probably refund the difference per their "Pre-order price guarantee", but it might be safer to wait.  Book seller BOOKSPLUSMORESTUFF claims to have the book "in stock" on Amazon for $53.94 including shipping.  That may or may not be true.

<p><b>November 14, 2008:</b> The book is finished and submitted to the
printer!  The official release date is January 1, 2009, though our
goal is to make it available on Amazon and other retailers by
mid-December.  To be notified upon publication, join the
low-traffic <a href="https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">nmap-hackers
announcement mailing list</a>.

<p><b>September 15, 2008:</b> The Black Hat/Defcon pre-release was a huge
success!  All of the Defcon copies were snapped up as soon as the
vendor room opened, and the Black Hat copies also sold out in the
first morning of the conference.  Thanks to Bill Pollock of No Starch
Press and Dave Hemsath of BreakPoint Books for handling sales.  My
conference presentation video and audio have
been <a href="http://insecure.org/presentations/">posted
online</a> just in time for
the <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2008/0004.html">Nmap

    exploration and security auditing.  It was designed to rapidly
    scan large networks, although it works fine against single
    hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
    hosts are available on the network, what services (application
    name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
    (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
    filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
    characteristics.  While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
    many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
    tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
    schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.</p><p>The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
    supplemental information on each depending on the options
    used. Key among that information is the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">interesting ports
    table</span>â</span>.<a class="indexterm" name="idm18934"></a>
    That table lists the port number and protocol,
    service name, and state.  The state is either
    <code class="literal">open</code>, <code class="literal">filtered</code>,
    <code class="literal">closed</code>, or <code class="literal">unfiltered</code>.
    <code class="literal">Open</code><a class="indexterm" name="idm18942"></a>
    means that an application on the target machine is listening for
    connections/packets on that port.
    <code class="literal">Filtered</code><a class="indexterm" name="idm18946"></a>
    means that a firewall, filter, or other network
    obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
    <code class="literal">open</code> or <code class="literal">closed</code>.
    <code class="literal">Closed</code><a class="indexterm" name="idm18952"></a>
    ports have no application listening on them,
    though they could open up at any time.
    Ports are classified as
    <code class="literal">unfiltered</code><a class="indexterm" name="idm18956"></a>
    when they are
    responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
    open or closed.
    Nmap reports the state combinations
    <code class="literal">open|filtered</code><a class="indexterm" name="idm18960"></a>
    and <code class="literal">closed|filtered</code><a class="indexterm" name="idm18964"></a>
    when it cannot determine which
    of the two states describe a port.  The port table may also
    include software version details when version detection has been
    requested.  When an IP protocol scan is requested
    (<code class="option">-sO</code>), Nmap provides information on supported IP
    protocols rather than listening ports.</p><p>In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
    further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
    operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.</p><p>A typical Nmap scan is shown in <a class="xref" href="man.html#man-ex-repscan" title="ExampleÂ 15.1.Â A representative Nmap scan">ExampleÂ 15.1</a>.  The only Nmap arguments used in
    this example are <code class="option">-A</code>, to enable OS and version
    detection, script scanning, and traceroute; <code class="option">-T4</code> for
    faster execution; and then the hostname.</p><div class="example"><a name="man-ex-repscan"></a><p class="title"><b>ExampleÂ 15.1.Â A representative Nmap scan</b></p><div class="example-contents"><a class="indexterm" name="idm18975"></a><pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org</code></strong>

<h2 class="purpleheader">Downloading Nmap</h2>

<P>Nmap and Zenmap (the graphical front end) are available in
several versions and formats.  Recent source releases and binary
packages are described below.  Older version (and sometimes newer test
releases) are available from the <A
HREF="https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&amp;O=D">dist directory</A>
(and really old ones are in <A HREF="https://nmap.org/dist-old/">dist-old</a>).
For the more
security-paranoid (smart) users, GPG detached signatures and SHA-1
hashes for each release are available in the <a
href="https://nmap.org/dist/sigs/?C=M&amp;O=D">sigs
directory</a> (<a href="book/install.html#inst-integrity">verification instructions</a>).  Before downloading, be sure to read the relevant sections for your platform from the <a href="book/install.html">Nmap Install Guide</a>.  The most
important changes (features, bugfixes, etc) in each Nmap version are
described in the <A HREF="changelog.html">Changelog</A>.  Using Nmap is covered in the <a href="book/man.html">Reference Guide</a>, and don't forget to read
the other <A HREF="docs.html">available documentation</A>, particularly the new book <a href="book/">Nmap Network Scanning</a>!

<P>Please read
the <a href="book/inst-windows.html">Windows section</a> of the
Install Guide for limitations and installation instructions for the
Windows version of Nmap. You can choose
from a self-installer (includes dependencies and also the Zenmap GUI)
or the much smaller command-line zip file version. We support Nmap on Windows 7 and newer, as well as Windows Server 2008 and newer.  We also maintain a <a href="https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap/Old_Windows_Releases">guide for users
who must run Nmap on earlier Windows releases.</a>.

<P><b>Note:</b> The version of Npcap included in our installers may not always be the latest version. If you experience problems or just want the latest and greatest version, download and install <a href="https://nmap.org/npcap/#download">the latest Npcap release.</a>

<P>The Nmap <b>executable Windows installer</b> can handle Npcap
installation, registry performance tweaks, and decompressing the
executables and data files into your preferred location.  It also includes the Zenmap graphical frontend.  Skip all the
complexity of the Windows zip files with a self-installer:

instructions</a>.  Please <a href="book/man-bugs.html">notify us</a>
if you encounter any problems or have suggestions for the
installer.

<P>For those who prefer the command-line zip files (<a
href="book/inst-windows.html">Installation Instructions</a>; <a
href="book/inst-windows.html#inst-win-exec">Usage
Instructions</a>), they are still available.  The Zenmap graphical
interface is <i>not</i> included with these, so you need to run
nmap.exe from a DOS/command window.  Or
you can download and install a superior command shell such as those
included with the free <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin system</A>.
Also, you need to run the <a href="http://www.npcap.org">Npcap</a>
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40784">Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package</a>
installers which are included in
  the zip file.  The main advantage is that these zip files are a fraction of
  the size of the executable installer:<BR>

<A NAME="linux-rpm"></A>
<h2 class="purpleheader">Linux RPM Source and Binaries</h2>

<P>Many popular Linux distributions (Redhat, Mandrake, Suse, etc) use
the <A HREF="http://www.rpm.org">RPM</A> package management system for
quick and easy binary package installation. We have
written a detailed <a href="book/inst-linux.html#inst-rpm">guide to
installing our RPM packages</a>, though these simple commands usually do
the trick:

<PRE>
rpm -vhU https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.70-1.x86_64.rpm
rpm -vhU https://nmap.org/dist/zenmap-7.70-1.noarch.rpm
rpm -vhU https://nmap.org/dist/ncat-7.70-1.x86_64.rpm
rpm -vhU https://nmap.org/dist/nping-0.7.70-1.x86_64.rpm

You can also download and install the RPMs yourself:<BR>

<A NAME="macosx"></A>
<h2 class="purpleheader">Mac OS X Binaries</h2>

<P>Nmap binaries for Mac OS X (Intel x86) are distributed as a disk image file
containing an installer. The installer allows installing Nmap, Zenmap,
Ncat, and Ndiff. The programs have been tested on Intel computers
running Mac OS X 10.8 and later.  See the
<a href="/book/inst-macosx.html">Mac OS X Nmap install
page</a> for more details. Users of PowerPC (PPC) Mac machines, which Apple ceased selling in 2006, should see <a href="https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap/Mac_OSX_PPC">this page instead</a> for support information.<br><br>

<A NAME="source"></A>
<h2 class="purpleheader">Source Code Distribution</h2>

<P>This is the traditional compile-it-yourself format.  The Nmap
tarball compiles under Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and many UNIX
platforms (Solaris, Free/Net/OpenBSD, etc.)  It includes Zenmap, the
GUI frontend. 

<P>Detailed Linux/BSD/Solaris compilation instructions and options are <a href="book/inst-source.html">provided here</a>, though this usually does the trick:

<PRE>
bzip2 -cd nmap-7.70.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
cd nmap-7.70
./configure
make
su root
make install
</PRE>

<P>Most Windows users install with our <a href="#windows">Windows executable installer</a>, but we also provide <a href="book/inst-windows.html#inst-win-source">Windows source code compilation instructions</a>.

<P>Most Mac OS X users install with our <a href="#macosx">Mac installer</a>, but we also provide <a href="/book/inst-macosx.html#inst-macosx-source">Mac OS X source code compilation instructions</a>.

<P>If you are compiling Nmap anyway, you might prefer to get the very latest code from <a href="/book/install.html#inst-svn">our SVN source code repository</a> rather than downloading a tarball here.
