	<h2>MASTER DOMAIN REGISTRATION AGREEMENT</h2>

		<p><strong>THIS REGISTRATION AGREEMENT</strong> ("Agreement"), is between Tucows Domains Inc. ("Tucows") and you, on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent ("Registrant"), as offered through __________________ ___________________________, the Reseller participating in Tucows' distribution channel for domain name registrations. Any reference to "Registry" or "Registry Operator" shall refer to the registry administrator of the applicable top-level domain ("TLD"). This Agreement explains Tucows' obligations to Registrant, and Registrant's obligations to Tucows, for the domain registration services. By agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Registrant agrees to be bound by the rules and regulations set forth in this Agreement, and by a registry for that particular TLD.</p>

		<p><strong>DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION.</strong> Domain name registrations are for a limited term, which ends on the expiration date communicated to the Registrant. A domain name submitted through Tucows will be deemed active when the relevant registry accepts the Registrant's application and activates Registrant's domain name registration or renewal. Tucows cannot guarantee that Registrant will obtain a desired domain name, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is available at the time of application. Tucows is not responsible for any inaccuracies or errors in the domain name registration or renewal process.</p>

		<p><strong>FEES.</strong> Registrant agrees to pay Reseller the applicable service fees prior to the registration or renewal of a domain. All fees payable here under are non-refundable even if Registrant's domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your current registration term.</p>

		<p><strong>TERM.</strong> This Agreement will remain in effect during the term of the domain name registration as selected, recorded and paid for at the time of registration or renewal. Should the domain name be transferred to another registrar, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall cease.</p>

		<p><strong>EXPIRATION, RENEWAL AND FORFEITURE.</strong> The registered domain name will expire on the expiration date specified in the registration term, and as communicated to the Registrant. Registrant will receive reminders immediately prior to the expiration inviting Registrant to renew the domain name. In the event that Registrant fails to renew the domain name in a timely fashion, the registration will expire and Tucows may, at its discretion, elect to assume the registration and may hold it in its own account, delete it, or sell it to a third party. During the period following the expiration of a domain name, the domain name will cease to resolve, the Whois registration records may be revised to include that of Tucows or its reseller, and visitors to Registrant's website may be directed to a default web page. This default web page may feature advertisements posted by Tucows for its own account. Registrant acknowledges and agrees that Registrant's right and interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration. Registrant is solely responsible for informing itself of the date of expiration and renewing its registration in a timely manner. If Tucows, in its sole discretion, elects to renew the registration, Registrant will be entitled to a grace period of forty (40) days during which Registrant may re-register the domain name. Additional costs for the redemption and re-registration will apply.</p>

		<p><strong>EXPIRED REGISTRATION RECOVERY POLICY.</strong> Domain expiration notices will be sent via email thirty (30) days and five (5) days prior to a domain expiration date and three (3) days after a domain expires. Renewal, post-expiration renewal and redemptions fees are published at <a href="https://opensrs.com/services/domains/domain-pricing/">opensrs.com/services/domains/domain-pricing</a>. Reseller's fees may differ.</p>

		<p><strong>REGISTRANT INFORMATION AND DATA SHARING.</strong> Data required for the registration of a domain name varies by top-level domain. The required data for a domain name registration (âMinimum Dataâ) will be presented at the time of registration or renewal and may include up to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Name and postal address of the Registered Name Holder;</li>
				<li>Registered name;</li>
				<li>Names of the primary nameserver and secondary nameserver(s) for the Registered Name;</li>
				<li>Name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the administrative contact for the domain name;</li>
				<li>Name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the billing contact for the domain name; and</li>
				<li>Name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the technical contact for the domain name.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The Minimum Data will be shared with Tucows and the relevant authoritative registry services provider for your top-level domain. The identity of the authoritative registry services provider can be found at https://www.iana.org/whois. The Minimum Data for domains in any TLD you have registered can be found in the Data Use Information Page.</p>

		<p><strong>ACCURATE INFORMATION.</strong> Registrant represents and warrants that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The statements that Registrant makes in connection with the domain name registration, maintenance, or renewal are complete and accurate;</li>
				<li>Registrant information will be kept current;</li>
				<li>Registrant will not and will not permit others to use the domain name in violation of any ICANN or registry policies, applicable laws or regulations, or legal rights of others;</li>
				<li>Registrant will respond to inquiries from Tucows addressed to the email address of the Registrant, the administrative, billing or technical contact with respect to a domain name concerning the accuracy of contact details.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Registrant acknowledges that a breach of this Section 8 will constitute a material breach of the Agreement, which will entitle either Tucows or a registry to terminate this Agreement immediately upon such breach without any refund and without notice to Registrant.</p>

		<p><strong>ACCOUNT REVIEW, DATA MODIFICATION OR DELETION.</strong> To access, view, update, delete or download data associated with your domain name registration, you must be signed into your account. If you make a request to delete your personal data and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements. In some cases, when data is necessary for the provisioning of service, deletion of data may cancel or suspend the services you have purchased. If you have difficulty accessing your data, modifying it, or deleting it, you may request assistance by sending email to DPA @ Tucows.com or using the contact information at <a href="https://opensrs.com/privacy-policy/">opensrs.com/privacy-policy</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>ICANN-REQUIRED DISCLOSURES.</strong> Domain name registration requires sharing the Registrant's information, in whole or in part, with the applicable Registry Operator and with ICANN. Both Tucows and the Registry Operator may be required to archive this information with a third-party escrow service. Further, Registrant represents and warrants that, if Registrant is providing information about a third party, Registrant has notified the third party of the required disclosures and the purpose for the disclosures and Registrant has obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure. ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that Tucows may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available.</p>

		<p><strong>SUSPENSION AND CANCELLATION.</strong> Tucows may in its sole discretion, suspend or cancel Registrant's domain name registration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>if Registrant breaches this Agreement;</li>
				<li>if Registrant fails to provide payment or accurate contact or billing information;</li>
				<li>in the event there was an error in the registration process for such domain name;</li>
				<li>as required by ICANN or a Registry Operator;</li>
				<li>to protect the integrity and stability of Tucows and any applicable registry;</li>
				<li>to comply with any applicable laws, government rules, requests of law enforcement and court orders;</li>
				<li>in compliance with any dispute resolution process; or</li>
				<li>to avoid any liability, civil or criminal.</li>
			</ul>

		<p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</strong> Registrant is bound by all ICANN consensus policies and all policies of any relevant Registry Operator, including the Uniform Rapid Suspension Procedure, the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution policy (UDRP), along with the UDRP rules and all supplemental rules of any UDRP provider. ICANN may change the UDRP at any time. If a third party challenges the registration or reservation of the Registrant's domain name, Registrant will be subject to the provisions specified in the dispute policy adopted by the applicable registry. In the event a domain name dispute arises, Registrant will indemnify and hold Tucows harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable policy. If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding a domain name, Tucows may, at its sole discretion, suspend use of the domain name and the ability to make modifications to the registration records until:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tucows is directed to do so by the judicial or administrative body, or</li>
				<li>Tucows receives notification from both parties that the dispute has been settled.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>If Registrant or Registrant's domain name becomes the subject of litigation, Tucows may deposit control of Registrant's domain name record into the registry of the judicial body by supplying a party with a registrar certificate.</p>

		<p><strong>WHOIS PRIVACY SERVICE.</strong> If Registrant elects to use the Whois privacy registration service, the following terms and conditions will apply:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The publicly available Registrant contact information will list Contact Privacy Inc. Customer #### (where #### is a unique customer identification number) as the Registrant and contact name, and Tucows' postal address, assigned email address and telephone number as contact information.</li>
				<li>Tucows will keep the Registrant and Contact Information provided by Registrant on file. Both Tucows and the Registry may be required to archive this information with a third-party escrow service, as per ICANN policy.</li>
				<li>Registrant will retain complete control over the domain name and its registration records and may suspend and reinstate the Whois Privacy Service at its discretion.</li>
				<li>With respect to a domain name that has been transferred to Tucows, the Whois Privacy Service will only commence after the transfer has been completed. If Registrant elects to transfer a domain name to a different registrar, the Whois Privacy Service must be disabled in order to initiate the transfer.</li>
				<li>Tucows will send all obligatory renewal and transfer related messages to the contacts that Registrant has designated.</li>
				<li>Pricing for the Whois privacy registration service will be set by the Reseller, and Registrant will pay Reseller for this service.</li>

					<p>	Toronto (ON) M6K 3M1</p>
					<p>CANADA</p>
				<li>Tucows shall have the right, at its sole discretion and without liability to Registrant, to suspend or cancel the Whois Privacy Service and to reveal Registrant and Contact Whois Information in certain circumstances, including but not limited to the following:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>when required by law;</li>
						<li>in the good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to further determination of an alleged breach of a law;</li>
						<li>to comply with a legal process served upon Tucows;</li>
						<li>to resolve any and all third party claims including but not limited to ICANN's or a Registry's dispute resolution policy;</li>
						<li>to avoid financial loss or legal liability;</li>
						<li>if Tucows believes that Registrant or one of Registrant's contacts is using the Whois Privacy Service to conceal involvement with illegal, illicit, objectionable or harmful activities; or to transmit SPAM, viruses, worms or other harmful computer programs.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

		<p><strong>POLICY.</strong> Registrant agrees that its registration of the domain name shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to a Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, or pursuant to any registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with a Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy,</p>
			<ul>
				<li>to correct mistakes by Tucows or a registry in registering the name or</li>
				<li>for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.</li>
			</ul>

		<p><strong>TRADEMARK CLEARINGHOUSE (TMCH).</strong> Registrant agrees to abide by the terms and conditions set forth by Tucows and the Trademark Clearinghouse Agreement available at <a href="http://opensrs.com/site/resources/agreements#contracts">opensrs.com/site/resources/agreements#contracts</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>NO GUARANTEE.</strong> Registrant acknowledges that registration of a chosen domain name does not confer immunity from objection to the registration, reservation or use of the domain name.</p>

		<p><strong>AGENCY.</strong> If Registrant intends to license use of a domain name to a third party, Registrant is deemed the domain name holder of record and is responsible for providing Registrant's own full contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name. Registrant shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain name, unless it promptly discloses the licensee's identity and current contact information (as provided by the licensee) to a party providing the Registered Name Holder reasonable evidence of actionable harm. Registrant represents that it will secure the agreement of any third party to the terms and conditions in this Agreement.</p>

		<p><strong>MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT.</strong> Tucows may modify this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement, as is necessary to comply with its agreements with ICANN, a registry or any other entity or individual, as well as to adjust to changing circumstances. All amendments to this Agreement will be posted on our website at <a href="http://www.opensrs.com/docs/contracts/exhibita.htm">opensrs.com/docs/contracts/exhibita.htm</a>. Your continued use of the registered domain name will constitute your acceptance of this Agreement with any revisions. If you do not agree to any change, you may request that your domain name be cancelled or transferred to a different accredited registrar, and agree that such cancellation or transfer will be your exclusive remedy if you do not wish to abide by any change to this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement.</p>

		<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENTS.</strong> Tucows reserves the right to distribute information to Registrant that is required by ICANN or Registry policy.</p>

		<p><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong> Registrant agrees that Tucows' entire liability, and Registrant's exclusive remedy, with respect to the domain registration service provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is solely limited to the amount Registrant paid for the initial registration of the domain name. Tucows, ICANN and the applicable registries shall not be liable for any lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, liability is limited to the extent permitted by law.</p>

		<p><strong>INDEMNITY.</strong> Registrant will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Tucows, ICANN, the applicable registries, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and contractors, from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorney's fees, arising out of or relating to</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Registrant's registration and use of the domain name registered;</li>
				<li>use of the domain name in violation of this Agreement; or</li>
				<li>Registrant's violation of any third party right, including Intellectual Property Rights. This indemnification obligation will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</li>
			</ul>

		<p><strong>TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.</strong> The person named as Registrant on record with Tucows shall be the "Registered Name Holder." If designated, the person named as administrative contact at the time the controlling account was secured shall be deemed the designate of the Registrant with the authority to manage the domain name. Registrant agrees that prior to transferring ownership of the domain name to another person (the "Transferee") Registrant shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by Tucows in its sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such transfer will be null and void. Registrant explicitly authorizes Tucows to act as their Designated Agent, as stipulated by the ICANN Transfer Policy, to approve a Change of Registrant on their behalf.</p>

		<p><strong>BREACH.</strong> Registrant agrees that failure to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any ICANN, Registry, URDP or Dispute operating rule or policy, may be considered by Tucows to be a material breach, and that Tucows may provide written notice, describing the breach, to Registrant. If within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of such notice, Registrant fails to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to Tucows, that Registrant has not breached its obligations under the Agreement, then Tucows may delete the registration the domain name. Any such breach by Registrant shall not be deemed to be excused simply because Tucows did not act earlier in response to that, or any other, breach by Registrant.</p>

		<p><strong>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.</strong> Except for the express warranties in this Agreement, Tucows does not make any other warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Tucows is not responsible or liable for the deletion or of failure to store any content and other communications maintained or transmitted through the use of the domain name registration service. Tucows does not warrant that the domain name registrations service will be error free or uninterrupted. The domain name registration service is not intended for high risk activities.</p>

		<p><strong>INCONSISTENCIES WITH REGISTRY POLICIES.</strong> In the event that this Agreement may be inconsistent with any term, condition, policy or procedure of an applicable Registry, the term, condition, policy or procedure of the applicable Registry shall prevail.</p>

		<p><strong>NON-WAIVER.</strong> Tucows failure to require performance by Registrant of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by Tucows of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself.</p>

		<p><strong>NOTICES.</strong> Any notice, direction or other communication given under this Agreement shall be in writing and given by sending it via e-mail or via regular mail. In the case of e-mail, valid notice shall only have been deemed to be given when an electronic confirmation of delivery has been obtained by the sender. E-mail notification to Tucows must be sent to domains@tucows.com. Any notice to Registrant will be sent to the e-mail address provided by Registrant in the Whois record.

						<br />Registrants must meet the following requirements:
						<ol type="1">
							<li>Focused on acting in the public interest. Whether in support of education or health, the environment or human rights, members of the .ngo|.ong community work for the good of humankind and/or the preservation of the planet and do not promote discrimination or bigotry.</li>
							<li>Non-profit making/non-profit-focused entities. While many NGOs engage in commercial activities or generate revenue in support of their missions, members of the .ngo|.ong community do not recognize profits or retain earnings.</li>
							<li>Limited government influence. Recognizing that many NGOs have important interactions with government, not least for reasons of funding (which may include receipt of some government funding in support of their programs), members of the .ngo|.ong community decide their own policies, direct their own activities and are independent of direct government or political control.</li>
							<li>Independent actors. Members of the .ngo|.ong community should not be political parties nor should be a part of any government. Participation in the work of a NGO or ONG is voluntary.</li>
							<li>Active organisations. Members of the .ngo|.ong community are actively pursuing their missions on a regular basis.</li>
							<li>Structured. Members of the .ngo|.ong community, whether large or small, operate in a structured manner (e.g. under bylaws, codes of conduct, organizational standards, or other government structures.)</li>
							<li>Lawful. Members of the .ngo|.ong community act with integrity within the bounds of law.</li>
						</ol></li>
					<li>To activate new domains, NGO organisations will also need to complete a post-registration validation process:
						<ol type="1">
							<li>Registrant is required to submit information and documentation to PIR establishing that it meets the eligibility requirements of an NGO.</li>
							<li>Validation documentation may consist of one or more of the following:
								<ol type="1">
									<li>i.	government list;</li>
									<li>corporate documents (e.g. Articles of Incorporation); and</li>
									<li>tax records or other documents evidencing the entityâs charitable status and work in the community it serves.</li>
								</ol>
							<li>Registrant is required to certify that the information and documentation it submitted in the validation process remains true, complete, and accurate at least once every two years after initial validation.</li>
							<li>If the registrant does not successfully complete the validation process within one year from the date it registers the domain name bundle, the domain name bundle will be deleted and released back into the pool of available domains and any fees paid in connection with the registration of the domain name bundle will be forfeit.</li>
							<li>Registrant acknowledges and understands that, in the event it is selected for an audit, it will promptly comply with any inquiries and requests from the Registry to provide additional evidence of its NGO status.</li>
						</li></ol></li>
					<li>If, as a result of the audit process, the Registry determines (in its sole discretion) that the Registrant does not meet the NGO eligibility requirements, the Registrantâs domain name bundle will be deleted and released back into the pool of available domains and any fees paid in connection with the Registrantâs domain name bundle will be forfeit.</li>
