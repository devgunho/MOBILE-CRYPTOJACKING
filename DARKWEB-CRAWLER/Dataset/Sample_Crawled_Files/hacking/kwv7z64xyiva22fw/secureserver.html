<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Unless otherwise noted, the provisions below in this Section 2 are generally applicable to all TLDs that we offer.&nbsp; Special provisions specific to any TLD or ccTLD (those in addition to posted Registry Policies) are identified elsewhere below in this Agreement.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Registry Policies</span></em>.

As such the parties to this agreement acknowledge and agree that the third party beneficiary rights of the Registry Operator have vested and that the Registry Operator has relied on its third party beneficiary rights under this Agreement in agreeing to <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> being a registrar for the respective TLD.

</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Registration Requirements</span></em>.&nbsp; To the extent any TLD or ccTLD requires you meet eligibility (e.g., residency for .JP, .EU, etc.), validation (e.g., DNS validation) or other authentication requirements as a condition to registering a domain name in the TLD, you agree that by submitting an application or registering or renewing your domain name, you represent and warrant that: (a) all information provided to register or renew the domain name (including all supporting documents, if any) is true, complete and correct, and is not misleading in any way, and the application is made in good faith; (b) you meet, and will continue to meet, the eligibility criteria prescribed in the Registry Policies for the applicable TLD for the duration of the domain name registration; (c) you have not previously submitted an application for the domain name with another registrar using the same eligibility criteria, and the other registrar has rejected the application (if applicable); (d) you acknowledge and agree that even if the domain name is accepted for registration, your entitlement to register the domain name may be challenged by others who claim to have an entitlement to the domain name; and (e) you acknowledge and agree that the Registry or the registrar can cancel the registration of the domain name if any of the warranties required are found to be untrue, incomplete, incorrect or misleading.</div>
</li>
<li>

You shall not in any way transfer or purport to transfer a proprietary right in any domain name registration or grant or purport to grant as security or in any other manner encumber or purport to encumber a domain name registration.</div>
</li>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. FEES AND PAYMENTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this Site at the time you order the Services.&nbsp; <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.&nbsp; If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless otherwise specifically noted (for reasons such as those highlighted&nbsp;in Section 2(x) above), the renewal price for any domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale) price shown when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart prior to purchase.&nbsp; For example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different renewal price is not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also $9.99<strong></strong>.&nbsp; Likewise, if a domain name has a&nbsp;sale price of $8.99, with the list&nbsp;(non-sale) price&nbsp;shown (as a strike-through)&nbsp;at $9.99, the renewal price will be&nbsp;$9.99<strong>*</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em><strong>*Renewal price&nbsp;subject to change prior to actual date of renewal.&nbsp; </strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For all other terms and conditions relating to&nbsp;fees, payment, refund and billing, etc. applicable to the Services offered under the scope of this Agreement, please refer to the &ldquo;Fees and Payments&rdquo; section of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.secureserver.net/legal-agreement?plid=391143&id=utos" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">UTOS</span></span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>(B) DOMAIN NAME RENEWAL TERMS</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you register a domain name, you will have three renewal options: (i) "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automatic Renewal</span>"&nbsp;(ii) "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extended Automatic Renewal</span>", and (iii) "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manual Renewal</span>":&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automatic Renewal</span>.&nbsp; Automatic Renewal is the default setting. Therefore, unless you select&nbsp;Extended Automatic Renewal, <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> will enroll you in&nbsp;Automatic Renewal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Domain names will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, any domain name that is up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span>, at <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span>'s then current rates. Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> will automatically renew it for one (1) year. If you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extended Automatic Renewal</span>.&nbsp; If you enroll in the Extended Automatic Renewal plan, <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> will automatically renew any domain name that is up for renewal for an additional one-year period on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration, so the initial registration period will always remain intact.&nbsp; Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your two (2) year registration period will always remain intact. If you have chosen to register your domain name for five (5) years, <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your five (5) year registration period will always remain intact, and so on.&nbsp; <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span>, at <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span>'s then current one-year domain name registration rate.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manual Renewal</span>.&nbsp; If you have elected to turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel&nbsp;the domain name registration) effective at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its&nbsp;expiration date&nbsp;by&nbsp;logging into&nbsp;your <a href="https://www.secureserver.net/gdshop/shopper_lookup.asp?prog_id=391143" target="_blank">Account Manager</a>&nbsp;and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.&nbsp; Domain name renewals will be non-refundable. <span style="color: #5b9bd5; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-themecolor: accent1;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the event that we are unable to automatically renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.</span> </span>If for any reason <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration will expire.

For some ccTLDs (.es) renewal&nbsp;must be processed&nbsp;no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.&nbsp; When the domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by calling <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> and requesting that the domain name be renewed. You cannot renew the domain name through your <a href="https://www.secureserver.net/gdshop/shopper_lookup.asp?prog_id=391143" target="_blank">Account Manager</a>. If you fail to manually implement the renewal of any cancelled product before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You agree that <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail to renew in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement. In any case, if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply. If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you cancel in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> may, in its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf. If <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you may reimburse <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> for the renewal and keep your domain name. The Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12) days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk,&nbsp;and .vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period after the expiration date of the domain name. If you do not reimburse <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> a Redemption fee. The Redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30-day redemption period <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> may, in its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.&nbsp; During the redemption period your domain name may be parked.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> a redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renewal Grace Periods and Redemption Grace Periods vary for different ccTLDs. Please refer to the specific terms for the applicable TLD. In the event there is a conflict between the provisions of this paragraph and the ccTLD terms, the ccTLD terms shall control.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You further agree that you will not engage in "domain tasting" by using the five (5) day grace period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability or viability of a domain name.&nbsp; If <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> determines (which determination shall be made by <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging in "domain tasting", then <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> reserves the right to (a) charge you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b) refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether. <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> will not charge you a fee if <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control.

Failure by you, for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by <span class="legal-token-displayName">WordPress.com</span> to determine the validity of information provided by you, shall also be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.
