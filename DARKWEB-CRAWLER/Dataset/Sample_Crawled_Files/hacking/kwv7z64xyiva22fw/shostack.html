My short bio: Adam is a consultant, entrepreneur, technologist, author
and game designer. He's a member of the BlackHat Review Board, and
helped create the CVE and many other things.  He currently helps many
organizations improve their security via
<a href=https://associates.shostack.org>Shostack & Associates</a>, and
advises startups including as a Mach37 Star Mentor.  While at
Microsoft, he drove the Autorun fix into Windows Update, was the lead
designer of the SDL Threat Modeling Tool v3 and created the "Elevation
of Privilege" game.  Adam is the author
of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Threat-Modeling-Designing-Adam-Shostack/dp/1118809998/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1504107491&sr=8-1&keywords=threat+modeling&linkCode=ll1&tag=adamshostack-20&linkId=cc4d1967c923c9c8b254ee2d20dc564f">Threat

 <dt class="paper-title">Measuring the Impact of DMARC's Part in Preventing Business Email Compromise
  </dt>
<dd class="paper-data">This paper (done in partnership with Jay Jacobs
and Wade Baker) Since 2016, the Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) has been
working to accelerate adoption of DMARC, an email security standard,
by providing tools and resources to aid implementation. This paper
measures the economic benefit from that activity. In less than two
years, GCAâs DMARC initiative has resulted in more than 5,700
organizations across more than 180 countries adopting DMARC. This has
lead to significant financial benefits across a diverse array of
industries and governments.  The full report is at the <a href="https://www.globalcyberalliance.org/dmarc-economic-benefits-report/"

  </dt>
  <dd class="paper-data">My Blackhat 2018 talk is about how attacks
 always get better, and that means your threat modeling needs to
 evolve. This talk looks at what's new and important in threat
 modeling, organizes it into a simple conceptual framework, and makes
 it actionable. This includes new properties of systems being
 attacked, new attack techniques (like biometrics confused by LEDs)
 and a growing importance of threats to and/or through social media
 platforms and features. Take home ways to ensure your security
 engineering and threat modeling practices are up-to-date.  (The slides are available as a <a href="http://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Shostack-Threat-Modeling-in-2018.pdf">PDF</a> or <a href="https://1drv.ms/p/s!At_WCC0-WWpPi2nluEtR-poV8Kbc">online viewer</a>.)


      
<dt class="paper-title">That Was Close! Reward Reporting of Cybersecurity 'Near Misses'
 </dt>
 <dd class="paper-data">
   From the abstract: "While information regarding the causes of major
   breaches may become public after the fact, what is lacking is an
   aggregated data set, which could be analyzed for research
   purposes. This research could then provide clues as to trends in
   both attacks and avoidable mistakes made on the part of operators,
   among other valuable data... An alternative is a voluntary
   reporting scheme, modeled on the Aviation Safety Reporting System
   housed within NASA, and possibly combined with an incentive
   scheme. Under it, organizations that were the victims of hacks or
   ânear missesâ would report the incident, providing important
   details, to some neutral party. This database could then be used
   both by researchers and by industry as a whole. People could learn
   what does work, what does not work, and where the weak spots are.

							At a <a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/modsec/">Security Modeling workshop</a>, I presented " <a href="modsec08/Shostack-ModSec08-Experiences-Threat-Modeling-At-Microsoft.pdf">Experiences Threat Modeling at Microsoft</a>," a title which is pretty self explanatory. (Slightly updated from the workshop version.)

							As mentioned above, Elevation of Privilege: the Threat Modeling Game is the easy way to get started threat modeling. You can download a copy from <a href="https://github.com/adamshostack/eop">Github</a>, and there's a blog post with the <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2010/03/02/announcing-elevation-of-privilege-the-threat-modeling-game/">announcement</a>. My Black Hat 2010 talk " <a href="Elevation-of-Privilege-BlackHat2010ShostackFinal.pptx">The easy way to get started threat modeling</a> " covers some of why the game works, as does a longer paper, " <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/A/E/FAE1434F-6D22-4581-9804-8B60C04354E4/EoP_Whitepaper.pdf">Elevation of Privilege: Drawing Developers into Threat Modeling</a> " (PDF).

						A philosophical digression on the relationship of liberty and security 
					</h3>
					<p class="quote">
						"The freedom which we enjoy in our democratic government extends also to our ordinary life. We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien acts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our liberality. We live exactly as we please and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger. If with habits not of labor but of ease, and courage not of art but of nature, we are still willing to encounter anger, we have the double advantage of not suffering hardships before we need to, and of facing them in the hour of need as fearlessly as those who are never free from them. The price of courage will surely be awarded most justly to those who best know the difference between hardship and pleasure and yet are never tempted to shrink from danger. And it is only democratic people who, fearless of consequences, confer their benefits not from calculations of expediency but in the confidence of liberality.
