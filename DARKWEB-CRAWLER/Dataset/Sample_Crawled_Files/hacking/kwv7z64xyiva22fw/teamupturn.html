    <header class="heading" id="executive-summary">
      <h1 class="heading-title">Executive Summary</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="post" id="executive-summary-content"> <p class="post-content post-text">Facebook runs the worldâs largest social network. The company makes money by selling the opportunity to reach its users. Facebook delivers targeted, prioritized messages â from those who can pay â  to users who might not otherwise see them. These messages vary widely, and extend far beyond ads for consumer goods.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebook recently announced new measures to keep advertisers on its platform accountable â including a promise to make all ads on its platform visible to anyone who cares to examine them.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">On its face, this would seem to be an important change, in areas reaching far beyond politics. Civil rights groups could audit housing and credit ads for illegal discrimination. Consumer protection authorities could root out bad actors who target the vulnerable. And journalists could track how sponsored messages are shaping the public debate.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Unfortunately, we find that Facebookâs concrete plans fall short of its laudable commitments.</strong> This report details steps that Facebook must take to deliver fully on what it has promised.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">This report is the first rigorous, independent evaluation of Facebookâs new ad transparency plans. We evaluated the companyâs planned ad transparency interface (parts of which are currently being piloted in Canada); tested Facebookâs advertising tools and APIs; conducted a thorough review of the companyâs technical documentation and legal terms; and interviewed researchers, advocates, archivists, and journalists.</p>

<h2 class="post-content post-heading" id="findings">Findings</h2>

<ul class="post-list post-content">
  <li class="post-list-item">
    <p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Facebookâs ad transparency tools donât include an effective way for the public to make sense of the millions of ads running on its platform at any given time.</strong> If public actors cannot search, sort, and computationally analyze ad data, they have little hope of holding advertisers accountable.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="post-list-item">
    <p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Facebook has not yet committed to disclose critical pieces of the puzzle for most ads, such as how the ad is targeted and the size and nature of the audience it reaches.</strong> Without such data, the public cannot diagnose or track the most important, widespread problems, including discriminatory advertising.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="post-list-item">
    <p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Deciding which ads are âpoliticalâ is a flawed approach.</strong>  The companyâs currently announced goal is to use AI to help identify âpoliticalâ ads, and to offer some additional information about the ads in that special category. But AI canât make the distinction cleanly, and neither can humans.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="post-list-item">
    <p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Facebookâs existing legal and technical infrastructure allows for the changes proposed in this report.</strong> Facebook already designates ad content as being âavailable to anyoneâ in its data policies. And an examination of the companyâs Marketing APIs show that it already retains copies of all ads.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="post-content post-heading">Recommendations</h2>

<ul class="post-list post-content">
  <li class="post-list-item">
    <p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Facebook should make ad data publicly accessible through a robust programmatic interface, with search functionality.</strong> Ad transparency must allow members of the public to make sense of an individual advertiserâs behavior, and must allow them to locate ads of interest across the platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="post-list-item">
    <p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Facebook should provide a strong baseline of access to <em>all</em> ads.</strong> Bad actors are constantly seeking new ways to leverage Facebookâs powerful tools, and the search for problems must not be limited to special categories ads.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="post-list-item">
    <p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Facebook should disclose more data about adsâ reach, type, and audience.</strong> Ad transparency must include enough data for policy researchers and public advocates to conduct meaningful analyses and spot important trends. This includes information about how the ads were targeted and ultimately delivered.</p>
  </li>

  <li class="post-list-item">
    <p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Facebook has not yet committed to disclose critical pieces of the puzzle for most ads, such as how the ad is targeted and the size and nature of the audience it reaches.</strong> Without such data, the public cannot diagnose or track the most important, widespread problems, including discriminatory advertising.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="post-list-item">
    <p class="post-content post-text"><strong>Deciding which ads are âpoliticalâ is a flawed approach.</strong>  The companyâs currently announced goal is to use AI to help identify âpoliticalâ ads, and to offer some additional information about the ads in that special category. Unfortunately, thereâs no good way to decide which ads fall under such a rule, since the question of which messages are âpoliticalâ is <em>itself</em> political. AI canât make the distinction cleanly, and neither can humans.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebook can do better. The companyâs existing technical infrastructure, policies, and contracts pose no barriers to dramatically more useful ad transparency. For example: Facebook already designates ad content as being âavailable to anyoneâ in its data policies.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> It already retains copies of all ads and details about their delivery, even after ads finish running.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> And it already has powerful technical infrastructure that could provide state-of-the-art, programmatic access to all of the ads on its platform.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Amid growing concerns about user privacy, it is important to emphasize that usersâ personal data are entirely distinct from the paid, commercial messages that fuel Facebookâs profits. Recently, Facebook pledged to reduce the ways it allows usersâ data to be shared outside of the platform.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> However, these steps, while important, do relatively little to address how that same data is actually <em>used within the platform</em> â in partnership with advertisers â to propel targeted, paid messages.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebook must do better. First, the company should provide useful, robust access to all of the data it has <em>already committed to disclose</em>. Transparency of internet-scale activities must come with internet-scale tools. Second, Facebook should provide a strong baseline of access to all ads, not just those identified as âpoliticalâ in nature. Drawing and enforcing boundaries around political content will be difficult, and leave wide swaths of content unaddressed. Finally, Facebook should make more ad metadata available for public inspection. At minimum, the company should disclose, at least in broad terms, the size and nature of each adâs audience. More detail about adsâ targeting and engagement, if disclosed in appropriate and privacy-preserving ways, would further aid the public in diagnosing and addressing a wide range of illegality, discrimination, and abuse.</p>

<h2 class="post-content post-heading" id="this-report-addresses-facebook-s-specific-tools-and-commitments-but-facebook-is-far-from-the-only-company-with-room-for-improvement">This report addresses Facebookâs specific tools and commitments, but Facebook is far from the only company with room for improvement.</h2>
</div></aside>

<p class="post-content post-text">We urge Facebook to publicly commit to detailed, time-bound plans to address these recommendations; develop a concrete management strategy for achieving them; and define key performance indicators against which the public can judge the companyâs progress. Facebook should also discuss these issues with civil society stakeholders and advertisers. Getting ad transparency right would signal Facebookâs sincere interest in restoring trust that is quickly eroding between the company and the public.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Moreover, by taking these steps, Facebook can lead the way for other peer platforms â all of which are wrestling with similar issues<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> â toward a much-needed robust standard of digital advertising accountability beyond the confines of politics. While this report addresses Facebookâs specific tools and commitments, Facebook is far from the only company with room for improvement.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">This report proceeds as follows. First, we summarize the mechanics of advertising on Facebook and define some basic terminology. Second, we argue that digital ad transparency efforts must go beyond disclosures designed for individual users; they need to enable meaningful public scrutiny. Finally, we detail our technical and policy recommendations, which we consider a âminimum viable productâ for Facebookâs own ad transparency efforts â and a benchmark for the efforts of peer platforms.</p>

            <section class="post" id="the-mechanics-of-facebook-advertising-content"> <p class="post-content post-text">There is more to Facebook ads than meets the eye. Facebook ads are designed to blend in naturally alongside non-paid messages on the platform. Whenever possible, Facebook shares social information alongside these paid messages, like if a userâs friend has reacted or commented, in the same way it does for posts from friends.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> Ads can be shared widely, and live beyond their budgets â often without indication that their distribution was once subsidized. And they can be targeted with remarkable precision.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">This section describes basic concepts needed to understand the recommendations that follow. First, we describe how users and pages create and share posts, and some key differences between the two. Next, we define âad,â and explain how users encounter them on Facebook. Finally, we outline the powerful tools Facebook gives advertisers to target users, based on their personal data.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">The basic unit of communication on Facebook is a <em>post</em>.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> Posts come in different shapes and sizes and can contain different types of content including text, images, video, and links. Posts are attributed to a single profile.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> There are several different kinds of profiles on Facebook,<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> but this paper is concerned with user profiles (âusersâ) and page profiles (âpagesâ), which are together sufficient to discuss most advertising activity on the platform.</p>

</div></aside>

<p class="post-content post-text">A user typically represents a single person on Facebook.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> Pages, by contrast, represent a public entity like a business, brand, celebrity, or cause.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup> Users can set specific limits on who can see their posts (e.g., friends only, or a subset of friends),<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> while page posts are public, visible even to those who donât follow that page.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> Pages must be created by a user, who can appoint other users to help manage that page.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> In practice, a page for a large business is likely to be staffed by many team members (and an external advertising agency), whereas a small nonprofitâs page might be run by a single user. Facebook does not require pages to disclose the identity of their creator or managing users.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">35</a></sup> And, importantly, pages â and only pages â can pay Facebook to push their posts in front of users who might not otherwise see them.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">36</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebook does not formally define âadâ in its public policies, terms of service, or technical documentation.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote">39</a></sup> For the purposes of this paper, <em>ad</em> refers to a post that Facebook has, at any time, approved for paid distribution.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote">40</a></sup> Paid distribution is when Facebook shows a user an ad in exchange for payment or the potential of payment.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote">41</a></sup> More simply, an âadâ is a post that has, at any time, been backed by money. As we explain below, ads are built to seamlessly coexist with, and can at times be nearly indistinguishable from, other posts on Facebook.</p>

</div></aside>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebook offers many different ways to design ads. Ads can be designed to look like unpaid posts, and unpaid posts can be turned into ads with a few clicks. Moreover, advertisers can choose among a range of different post formats that are designed to help them achieve different goals.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">An ad designed to look like an standard, link-based post</p>
</div></figure>

<p class="post-content post-text">For example, a business that wants to encourage shopping might choose a carousel of product images.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote">42</a></sup> A charity soliciting donations might be sure to include a prominent âDonate Nowâ button.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote">43</a></sup> An organization hoping to raise awareness about its issues might mention a news article written by a third party, selecting the format that looks similar to other usersâ posts in hopes people will share it. <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote">44</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Users can see ads through <em>paid</em> or <em>organic</em> distribution.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote">45</a></sup> When a user sees an ad via paid distribution, it is subtly marked as âSponsored,â and the user can examine some of the reasons they are seeing it.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote">46</a></sup> Organic distribution, by contrast, refers to any other non-paid way a user might see the ad. For example, a userâs friend â who saw the ad via paid distribution â might have shared the ad, or a user might have visited the pageâs own feed on which the ad was visible. In these cases, the ad is not marked with the âSponsoredâ label, and depending on the adâs design might be nearly indistinguishable from another type of post.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">An ad can continue to circulate via organic distribution long after its budget for paid distribution expires.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote">47</a></sup> For many advertisers, this is an important feature: It allows them to sponsor a post that they hope will âgo viral,â and continue to reach users beyond its âad run.â</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebook analytics showing how a post can shift between paid and organic distribution over time (<a href="https://katielance.com/facebookanalytics/" class="post-link">Source</a>)</p>
</div></figure>

<p class="post-content post-text">For example, a page might pay enough to show a post to 1,000 users through paid distribution. If those users share the ad widely, it might end up being shown for free to millions more users â who would have no way of knowing that money had been spent on the post.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">In sum, the boundary between ads and other types of posts can be porous. Ads are designed to exist seamlessly among other kinds of posts that users see in their news feeds. These posts can move in and out of paid distribution. Paid posts can long outlive the money initially allocated to display them. And in many cases, it can be infeasible for users to determine when a post was initially propelled by money before going viral.</p>

<h3 class="post-content post-heading" id="targeting-dispatching-ads-with-surgical-precision">Targeting: Dispatching Ads with Surgical Precision</h3>

<p class="post-content post-text">Typically, advertisers only want certain kinds of users to see their ads. Facebook allows advertisers  to target ads with power and precision, choosing what kinds of users get to see, or are excluded from seeing, their messages.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">The most basic targeting tools provided by Facebook fall into a category the company calls <em>core audiences</em>.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote">48</a></sup> These include rudimentary demographic factors like location, age, gender, language, and field of study, based on information people provide to Facebook when filling in their profiles, as well as pages a user has liked.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote">49</a></sup> They also include hundreds of additional inferred categories based on details like what sorts of pages and content users interact with on and off Facebook.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote">50</a></sup> For example, advertisers can target based on usersâ inferred political leanings (âLikely to engage with political content (conservative)â), multicultural affinity (âHispanic (US - Bilingual)â), and household composition (âFamily-based householdsâ).</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

      </div>

<p class="post-content post-text">Advertisers can also specify their own <em>custom audiences</em> â lists of specific people provided by the advertiser. For example, a custom audience might consist of a retail storeâs customers, likely voters from a political database, visitors to the page ownerâs website, or others the advertiser has a special interest in reaching. Facebook anonymously matches information on these lists â commonly e-mail addresses and phone numbers â to users of Facebook, and serves those users ads.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote">51</a></sup></p>

      </div>

<p class="post-content post-text">Finally, one of the most powerful targeting tools at advertisersâ disposal is <em>lookalike audiences</em>. Lookalike audiences allow an advertiser to target people who share similarities with a predefined custom audience. Once the advertiser selects one of its custom audiences as a source, Facebook uses machine learning to find and target people whose characteristics and behavior resemble those of people on the original list.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote">52</a></sup> In effect, lookalike audiences allow advertisers to say âshow my messages to people who are like these people I already know.â</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebook does not say what factors its algorithm considers when determining whether someone is similar to the source audience for a lookalike audience. In fact, Facebook does not even know what characteristics of the source audience an advertiser wants to replicate.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote">53</a></sup> In turn, the advertiser is not given the identities of the lookalike users that Facebook finds. However, independent experiments have shown that distinct racial affinity or political affiliation of a source audience can be replicated in the resulting lookalike audience.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote">54</a></sup></p>

            <section class="post" id="ad-transparency-must-enable-meaningful-public-scrutiny-content"> <p class="post-content post-text">Any transparency effort must be judged in light of its goals. Like many companies, Facebook uses the word âtransparencyâ to describe different disclosures for different audiences. Sometimes, transparency is for individual users. For example, at the encouragement of European regulators, Facebook has made its data policies more âtransparentâ â that is, easier to read.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote">57</a></sup> Other times, transparency is for advertisers. For example, after miscalculating how much time users spent watching videos on its platform, Facebook promised to âincrease transparencyâ of its metrics by partnering with third parties to help verify its analytics.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote">58</a></sup> In other cases, transparency is for the public at large. For example, in response to concerns about government surveillance, Facebook maintains a âTransparency Reportâ tracking government requests for user data.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote">59</a></sup></p>

  <h1 class="post-content post-heading" id="part-of-the-point-of-transparency-is-both-to-inform-the-public-debate-and-to-build-trust">âPart of the point of transparency is both to inform the public debate and to build trust.â</h1>

</blockquote>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebookâs ad transparency effort must be designed for the public, in the broadest possible sense. It must go beyond labeling ads and providing notices to individual users, necessary as these features are. The company seems to agree: It has said its ad transparency plans are designed in part for those who act on its usersâ behalf, including reporters and political watchdog groups.<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote">61</a></sup> It purportedly wants this transparency to help it catch âmalicious actors fasterâ and to prevent âmore improper ads from running.â<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote">62</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Ad transparency should allow the public to both investigate known issues â ranging from consumer predation to illegal discrimination to misinformation â <em>and</em> to identify new ones. Facebook should welcome the help on both fronts. The company cannot provide the safest possible community for its users on its own. It already relies heavily on input from domain experts to inform and enforce its advertising policies.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote">63</a></sup> It will always struggle to address issues that are subjective and politically charged.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote">64</a></sup> And it does not yet have robust cultural and linguistic competence to identify novel cases of subtle discrimination across the globe.<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote">65</a></sup></p>

            </header>
            <section class="post" id="recommendations-content"> <p class="post-content post-text">To empower the public to hold both advertisers and the platform accountable, Facebook must augment its existing ad transparency steps. Below, we offer three recommendations, and explain why each is necessary. First, we recommend that ad data be provisioned in a useful way. Second, we recommend that a strong baseline of transparency be provided for all ads, not just for âpoliticalâ ads. Finally, we recommend that more ad data be disclosed.</p>

<h3 class="post-content post-heading" id="provide-ad-data-in-a-programmatic-and-searchable-form">Provide Ad Data in a Programmatic and Searchable Form</h3>

<div class="post-content post-text">
	<div class="recommendation">
		<p>
			<strong>Recommendation:</strong> Make ad data publicly accessible through a robust, programmatic interface with search functionality. Access to the interface can be governed by reasonable contractual and technical measures (e.g., non-commerciality requirements and rate limitations), but should be made available for wide public use. <em>This recommendation does not extend to any disclosures of user data, or data that might identify a user.</em>
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p class="post-content post-text">Ad transparency must, at minimum, allow members of the public to make sense of an individual advertiserâs behavior, and to locate ads of interest across the platform. Each day, there are millions of ads circulating on Facebook, sponsored by millions of different advertisers.<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote">72</a></sup> It is extraordinarily difficult to make sense of such large-scale activity, even for Facebook itself. If outsiders cannot search, sort, and computationally analyze this data, they have little hope of holding advertisers accountable. This is especially true given that many issues of concern may play out on a national â or even international â scale.</p>

<aside class="post-aside"><div class="aside-container right ">
<h2 class="post-content post-heading" id="if-public-actors-cannot-search-sort-and-computationally-analyze-ad-data-they-have-little-hope-of-holding-advertisers-accountable">If public actors cannot search, sort, and computationally analyze ad data, they have little hope of holding advertisers accountable.</h2>
</div></aside>

<p class="post-content post-text">Today, Facebookâs transparency effort falls far short. The ad transparency interface that Facebook is piloting in Canada requires users to manually load a single pageâs ads in a paginated view â and only displays ads that are currently running.<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote">73</a></sup> This design decision dramatically constrains accountability research efforts. For example, someone interested in investigating âopioid counselingâ ads would first have to manually determine which pages might be sponsoring related posts (e.g., by cross-referencing business names identified in other research or interviewing individual Facebook users) and then review those pages â slowly â by hand. In principle, every relevant ad might be âvisible,â but this is little consolation if they cannot be examined at any reasonable scale. As discussed below, Facebook is offering somewhat more powerful access to ads identified as being âpoliticalâ in nature â but this approach has its own limitations.</p>

<figure class="post-figure full"><div class="figure-container full"><img src="/static/reports/2018/facebook-ads/images/fbads.gif" class="figure-image" />
<p class="post-content post-text">Loading ads by hand in the current page transparency view.</p>
</div></figure>

<p class="post-content post-text">This limited user interface might tempt a public investigator to resort to browser plug-ins or custom software to analyze ad data at scale. But this would be risky: Facebook prohibits any kind of âautomated data collection,â even of public data.<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote">74</a></sup> Technological self-help, even to access data Facebook and page owners have purposefully made public, could result in loss of access to the platform.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebook should provide a better way for the public to review ads. Fortunately, the company already has the infrastructure to provide the public with more useful access. Many platforms offer two kinds of ways to access their data: user-facing interfaces, like websites and apps, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), designed for use by computer programs. Facebook is no different. For years, it has provided data in powerful and flexible ways to developers (through its Graph API) and marketers (through its Marketing API). This is exactly the kind of technical infrastructure needed for public accountability work today.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Student debt relief scams are pervasive on the internet.<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote">75</a></sup> In particular, fraudsters often target alumni of for-profit colleges, who disproportionately file loan claims alleging theyâve been misled or defrauded by federally approved colleges and universities.<sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote">76</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text"><strong>A robust ad transparency interface would allow a regulator or nonprofit researcher to study ads using terms like âstudent loanâ and âdebt forgivenessâ to learn about the size and scope of these predatory practices.</strong> Where applicable, they could also report offending ads to Facebook for violating its policies.<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote">78</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Facebook has committed to special treatment of âpoliticalâ ads, a designation which includes both electoral and issue ads.<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote">81</a></sup> Facebook will make ads identified as belonging in this category available in some kind of searchable database (but has not committed to making these ads programmatically available).<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote">82</a></sup> The company will also append labels and disclaimers to these ads and require related advertisers to undergo special authentication steps.<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote">83</a></sup> These are welcome reforms that are responsive to pressure from lawmakers and regulators.<sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote">84</a></sup></p>

</div></aside>

<p class="post-content post-text">Moreover, Facebook plans to use artificial intelligence to detect political ads,<sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote">87</a></sup> but the company has struggled to follow through on similar, albeit much simpler, commitments in the past.<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote">88</a></sup> Automated tools are a long way from being able to parse nuanced language, especially where contextual elements are critical.<sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote">89</a></sup> Inevitably, many important political ads will slip through the cracks.<sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote">90</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Given these difficulties, Facebook should welcome public scrutiny of <em>all</em> ads, regardless of whether they have been labeled as political. With broader access, public actors will be better positioned to help refine the scope of âpoliticalâ ads over time, and spot errors in Facebookâs automated tools.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Even if defining and detecting all political ads was possible, such an approach would still capture only a subset of important paid messages. Abuses of Facebookâs ad system reach far beyond the realms of politics, ranging from promotions for potentially fraudulent opioid rehab centers,<sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote">91</a></sup> to aggressive for-profit college âlead generation,â<sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote">92</a></sup> to anti-vaccination misinformation.<sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote">93</a></sup> Making all ads just as accessible and searchable as political ads would give public interest researchers a critical window to spot and track potentially harmful messages, as well as provide an important baseline for continued debate about how and when to label political ads.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">In short, robust ad transparency should cover the full gamut of sponsored activity on Facebook. It is important that Facebook provide a baseline of strong transparency â as described in the other recommendations â for <em>all</em> ads, not just those deemed political.</p>

<h3 class="post-content post-heading" id="disclose-more-ad-metadata">Disclose More Ad Metadata</h3>

<div class="post-content post-text">
	<div class="recommendation">
		<p>
			<strong>Recommendation:</strong> Disclose data about ads' reach, type, and audience â especially for ads that implicate important rights and public policies.

	</div>
</div>

<p class="post-content post-text">Ad transparency must include enough data for policy researchers and public advocates to conduct meaningful analyses and spot important trends. Sometimes, the content of ads alone can be helpful. But more data is usually needed to detect impact and intent. Without it, researchers will all too often be left in the dark.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Unfortunately, for most ads, Facebook has thus far chosen to disclose only the adâs content. With the exception of political ads, Facebook currently hides important metadata such as the number of user interactions (e.g., âLikesâ), shares, and video views from its ad transparency interfaces. It also does not disclose category labels for ads that the company has identified as offering housing, employment, or credit â the types of ads many would be most concerned about. And it does not reveal <em>any</em> information about how or to whom the ad was targeted. Each of these omissions has consequences.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">First, Facebook has not yet provided a way for researchers to gauge most adsâ reach. This makes it impossible for an outsider to make sense of a high-volume advertiserâs activity. Some advertisers run many thousands of ads at the same time; Facebook offers tools for them to do so with ease.<sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote">94</a></sup> Advertisers often run many versions of an ad to test which message is most effective.<sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote">95</a></sup> They can then choose to invest the bulk of their budget in the highest-performing versions â or seed the best-performing ads with a small budget and let them propagate organically to a wider audience. Donald Trumpâs presidential campaign, for example, boasted it ran 50,000 different ads per day.<sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote">96</a></sup> Without access to data indicating which ads are actually distributed and seen at scale, there is no way to hone in on the ads with the largest runs.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Second, Facebook does not make it possible to identify the ads it has <em>already</em> flagged as deserving extra scrutiny.<sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote">97</a></sup> In late 2016, responding to concerns by policymakers and civil rights leaders, Facebook began automatically identifying ads offering housing, employment, or credit.<sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote">98</a></sup> These labels allow the company to prompt advertisers to agree to Facebookâs antidiscrimination policies, and to restrict the use of certain ad targeting segments. However, the labels could also help outside researchers focus their attention on these important kinds of ads (without having to create their own classifiers). Moreover, by making these labels and others like them public, outside groups could help Facebook spot labelling mistakes â an issue with which the company has already struggled.<sup id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote">99</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text">Third, for most ads, Facebook has not yet promised any public disclosures about how ads are targeted.

Targeting data is essential to assess discrimination of all kinds.<sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote">102</a></sup> It is also crucial to spot ad campaigns that might seek to offend, misinform, or endanger particular communities based on race, religion, or sexual orientation.<sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote">103</a></sup> And it can help outside observers spot and keep track of important issue advocacy campaigns.<sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote">104</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text">In December 2017, ProPublica and The New York Times revealed that a number of large corporations used Facebookâs ad platform to place recruitment ads that were tailored for, and targeted toward, particular age groups.<sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote">105</a></sup> Facebookâs Vice President of Ads argued that these marketing strategies are permissible when âbroadly based and inclusive, not simply focused on a particular age group.â<sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote">106</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text">A watchdog group could further investigate the legality of these ad campaigns, but only with access to both their content <em>and</em> some sense of their targeting strategies.

<p class="post-content post-text">We see two complementary approaches to making ad targeting more transparent. First, Facebook could disclose information about the targeted <em>audience</em>, as specified by the advertiser. This would include, for example, a list of core targeting segments or a simple indication that a custom list or lookalike audience was used.<sup id="fnref:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote">108</a></sup> The company already makes a small subset of this data available to individual users.<sup id="fnref:109"><a href="#fn:109" class="footnote">109</a></sup> It would be of even greater value if opened to public scrutiny.</p>

<aside class="post-aside"><div class="aside-container right ">
<h2 class="post-content post-heading" id="an-outcome-based-approach-may-be-the-only-way-for-the-public-to-evaluate-custom-and-lookalike-audiences">An outcome-based approach may be the only way for the public to evaluate custom and lookalike audiences.</h2>
</div></aside>

<p class="post-content post-text">However, this approach has a critical limitation: Facebook cannot disclose the contents of a custom list or all of the correlations that led to the creation of a lookalike audience without offending both user privacy and advertiser confidentiality.<sup id="fnref:110"><a href="#fn:110" class="footnote">110</a></sup> Accordingly, Facebook could also disclose certain information about the <em>demographics</em> of the users who actually saw the ad. This kind of outcome-based approach may be the <em>only</em> way to evaluate custom and lookalike audiences.<sup id="fnref:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote">111</a></sup> The company has already taken a step down this road: For political ads, it will soon â[p]rovide demographics information (<em>e.g.</em> age, location, gender) about the audience that the ads reached.â<sup id="fnref:112"><a href="#fn:112" class="footnote">112</a></sup> This is an approach Facebook should continue to refine, and deploy more broadly.<sup id="fnref:113"><a href="#fn:113" class="footnote">113</a></sup></p>

<p class="post-content post-text">We urge Facebook to engage with civil society stakeholders, advertisers, and privacy experts to further discuss how, when, and under what circumstances to disclose additional targeting information. Among all the kinds of ad data, targeting data is likely to be the most contentious. Advocates should describe the kinds of disclosures they need to hold advertisers accountable. Advertisers should identify legitimate concerns about competition and business confidentiality issues. And privacy experts should be on the lookout for circumstances when disclosures of information might implicate usersâ privacy, especially when target audiences are small.</p>

<p class="post-content post-text">There will be room for compromise. It may be appropriate to disclose targeting for the most important types of ads, or to impose enhanced contractual requirements for those accessing more detailed targeting information through a transparency interface. In any case, Facebook has plenty of tools â both technical and legal â with which to properly balance business interests and important public accountability goals.</p>

            <section class="post" id="conclusion-content"> <p class="post-content post-text">Facebook has made an important commitment to ad transparency. Public actors have been, and will continue to be, vital to diagnosing, and thinking critically about how to address, a wide range of abuses on internet platforms. Journalists, public interest groups, and researchers stand ready to help make sense of how money helps propel misinformation, predation, and discrimination across the platform â and to hold both platforms and their customers accountable. By taking the additional steps outlined in this report, Facebook would give the public powerful tools to further such critical work, and demonstrate its commitment to taking a broader view of its responsibility.</p>
