***Located at the back of The Belfrey Theatre and Arts Centre, Prince's Street, Wellington, TF1 1JG***

Telford Makerspace is a community run group with a small membership fee, aimed at makers, tinkerers, fixers and artists. The aim is to help each other on a variety of technology projects. There are various tools and equipment available for everybody to use, and this will build up as the group becomes more established. You don't have to have any particular skills or experience to join us - just enthusiasm and a willingness to join in and give it a go. 

*We have regular meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 7 to 10pm, and also most Saturdays from 10am to 4pm. Feel free to drop by!*

**Please see our "Join" page in the menu above to register for membership.**

Some of the things we are interested in:

 * 3D Printing 
 * Electronics 
 * Arduino and microcontrollers
 * Motors, Lights, Speakers and Sensors
 * Programming and computers
 * Raspberry Pi - robots and autonomous vehicles
 * Arts, Crafts and Animatronics
 * Making, Fixing and Customising gadgets for fun
