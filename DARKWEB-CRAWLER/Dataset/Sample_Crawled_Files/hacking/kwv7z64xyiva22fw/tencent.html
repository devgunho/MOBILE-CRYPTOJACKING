          <p >Magellan is a number of vulnerabilities that exist in SQLite. These vulnerabilities were discovered by Tencent Blade Team and verified to be able to successfully implement remote code execution in Chromium browsers. As a well-known database, SQLite is widely used in all modern mainstream operating systems and software, so this vulnerability has a wide range of influence. SQLite and Google had confirmed and fixed this vulnerability. We will not disclose any details of the vulnerability at this time, and we are pushing other vendors to fix this vulnerability as soon as possible.</p>
