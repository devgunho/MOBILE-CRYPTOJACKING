Can you check?â</p>
<p>We dread this sort of query because modern computer exploits are as complex, clever, and hard to reason about as modern computers â particularly if someone has the ability to physically access your device, as is routinely the case with laptops, especially when traveling. So while itâs definitely possible to detect certain types of tampering, it isnât always trivial. And even in controlled environments, itâs impossible to give a laptop a clean bill of health with full confidence â itâs always possible that it was tampered with in a way you did not think to check.</p>
<p>The issue of tampering is particularly relevant for human rights workers, activists, journalists, and software developers, all of whom hold sensitive data sought by powerful potential attackers. People in these vocations are often keenly aware of the security of their laptops while traveling â after all, laptops store critical secrets like communication with sources, lists of contacts, password databases, and encryption keys used to vouch for source code you write, or to give you access to remote servers.</p>

<p>How safe is it to leave your laptop in your hotel room while youâre attending sessions at a conference? If you come back to find your laptop in a different position than where you thought you left it, can you still trust it? Did someone tamper with it, did a hotel housekeeper simply straighten up the items you left on your desk, or did you misremember where you left it?</p>
<p>These questions typically canât be answered with total confidence because clever tampering can be so hard to detect. But I hoped I could get a sense of the risks with a carefully controlled experiment. For the last two years, I have carried a âhoneypotâ laptop with me every time I&#8217;ve traveled; this computer was intended to attract (and then detect) tampering. If any hackers, state-sponsored or otherwise, wanted to hack me by physically messing with my computer, I wanted to not only catch them in the act, but also gather technical evidence that I could use to learn how their attack worked and, hopefully, who the attacker was.</p>
<p>While traveling by air, I checked this laptop in my luggage to make it easily accessible to border agents, both domestic and foreign, to tamper with if they chose to. When staying in hotels, I left the laptop sitting on the desk in my room while I was away during the day, to make sure that any malicious housekeepers with permission to enter my room, or anyone else who broke into my room, was free to tamper with it if they chose to. I also put a bunch of hacker stickers all over it, hoping that this would make it a more enticing target.</p>

<p class="caption">A ânotice of baggage inspectionâ from TSA.</p>
<p class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Micah Lee</p></div>Over the duration of this experiment, I traveled to Europe three times and domestically in the United States five times (including once to Puerto Rico). I found eight different notices from the Transportation Security Administration informing me that my baggageÂ had been searched. I have no way of knowing how many times itÂ had been searched by other authorities who werenât kind enough to leave me a note.</p>
<p>I never caught anyone tampering with this laptop. But the absence of any evidence of tampering â and my obsessive thoughts about the various ways an attacker could have evaded by detection â serve to underline how fraught the process of computer forensics can be. If someone who makes their living securing computers thinks they could have missed a computer infection, what hope is there for the average computer user?</p>
<p>At the end of my experiment, I thought through all of the things that could have gone wrong. Perhaps someone did tamper with my honeypot laptop, and my methodology for detecting this wasnât thorough enough to notice. Or maybe potential attackers noticed that the laptop I carried with me and used at the conferences I was attending was different than the one I left in my room, and decided against tampering with it in case it was a trap.</p>
<p>But the most likely reason I didnât catch any attackers is that no one tried to tamper with my laptop. Hacking a targetâs laptop by physically tampering with it while theyâre traveling probably happens only rarely because itâs so expensive â it may require travel, physical surveillance, breaking and entering, and the risk of getting caught or breaking the laptop is high. Compare this to cheap forms of hacking like email phishing: You can target thousands of people at once from the comfort of your office, and the risk of getting caught is much lower.</p>
<p>Still, I believe actively checking devices for tampering is worthwhile. Youâll never catch an attacker in the act if you never look for evidence of their attacks. And just looking for evidence, even if you donât find any, increases costs for attackers: If they want to be sure you wonât notice, theyâre going to have to get more creative. I believe itâs useful to explain the technology and the methodology I came up with to detect tampering and share what I learned from the experience. Doing so gives a taste of just how many ways there are to tamper with a laptop.</p>

<h3>Evil Maid Attacks</h3>
<p>If you donât <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/04/27/encrypting-laptop-like-mean/">use full disk encryption</a> on your laptop, anyone who gains physical access to it, even for just a few minutes, can access all of your data and even implant malware on your computer to spy on you in the future. It doesnât matter how good your password is because without encryption, the attacker can simply unscrew the case on your laptop, remove your hard disk, and access it from another computer.</p>
<p>Disk encryption does a great job of protecting your data in case you lose your laptop or someone steals it from you. When this person tries accessing your data, they should be completely locked out, so long as the passphrase you use to unlock your laptop is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/">strong enough</a> that they canât guess it.</p>
<p>But there is a sneaky class of attack, called âevil maidâ attacks, that disk encryption alone cannot protect against. Evil maid attacks work like this: An attacker (such as a malicious hotel housekeeper, for example) gains temporary access to your encrypted laptop. Although they canât decrypt your data, they can spend a few minutes tampering with your laptop and then leave it exactly where they found it. When you come back and type in your credentials, <i>now</i> you have been hacked.</p>
<p>Exactly how an evil maid attack would work against your laptop depends on many factors: the type of computer you use, what operating system you use, which disk encryption software you use, and the configuration of firmware used to boot your computer, firmware which Iâll call âBIOS,â although it can also go by acronyms like EFI and UEFI. Some computers have considerably better technology to prevent evil maid attacks than others â for example, attackers have to do more advanced tampering to hack a Windows laptop encrypted with BitLocker than they do to hack a Mac laptop encrypted with FileVault (<a href="https://twocanoes.com/secureboot-imac-pro/">as of now</a>, anyway) or a Linux laptop encrypted with LUKS.</p>

<p class="caption">The honeypot laptop I used, with red boxes around the hard disk and the SPI flash chip that stores the BIOS firmware.</p>
<p class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Micah Lee</p></div><br />
Here are the main ways that an attacker could physically tamper with your laptop:</p>
<p><b>An attacker could modify data on your hard disk.</b> âFull disk encryption,â the term used to refer generically to systems like FileVault, really ought to be called ânearly full disk encryptionâ because, except in a few specific circumstances, thereâs always a small part of a computerâs disk that isnât encrypted.</p>
<p>When you power on your laptop, before your disk has been unlocked, your computer loads a program from this unencrypted part of your disk; it then runs the program, and the program asks you to enter your passphrase. The program converts your passphrase into an encryption key and tries to use it to unlock the disk. If you typed the correct passphrase, the disk unlocks, and the rest of the operating system (which is stored in the encrypted part of the disk) boots up. If you donât know the right passphrase, there is no way to unlock the disk.</p>
<p>But since the program that asks for your passphrase isnât encrypted, itâs possible for an attacker that physically has your laptop to replace it with a malicious version that looks exactly the same to the user, but that takes extra steps. For example, after you successfully unlock your disk, it might copy malware onto it that, after the computer finishes booting up, automatically runs in the background, spying on what youâre doing.</p>
<p>Computers that support âsecure bootâ or âverified boot,â such as Chromebooks and Windows laptops with BitLocker, arenât vulnerable to this. The BIOS can detect if the unencrypted part of your disk has been tampered with, and if it has, it will refuse to boot. MacBooks and laptops that run Linux could potentially be attacked in this way.</p>
<p><b>An attacker could replace your BIOS firmware with malicious firmware.</b> When you power on your computer, the very first program that your computer runs is your BIOS firmware. The job of this program is to initialize all of your hardware â your memory, disks, Wi-Fi adapter, video card, USB ports, and everything else â and then ultimately boot an operating system, typically the one stored on your hard disk.</p>
<p>When you format your disk and install a new operating system on your computer, your BIOS firmware doesnât change. This is because this program isnât stored on your hard disk at all. Instead, itâs stored in a small chip on your computerâs motherboard called an SPI flash chip.</p>
<p>This is why BIOS malware is so stealthy â you canât get rid of it by formatting your hard disk, and it can spy on you across operating systems, such as if you boot to a <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> USB stick.</p>
<p>SPI flash chips have eight pins, including one for providing the chip with power, one for reading data, and one for writing data to the chip. This means that itâs possible for an attacker to power off your laptop, open up the case, and attach their own wires to the SPI flash chip pins in order to power it on, and then read and write data to it (the chip itself has no way of telling the difference between this, or just being part of the normal computer). Using this technique, an attacker with physical access to your laptop can replace your BIOS firmware with whatever malware they want.</p>
<p>The Italian spyware firm Hacking Team was caught <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-uses-uefi-bios-rootkit-to-keep-rcs-9-agent-in-target-systems/">selling such BIOS malware</a> to its customers (the companyâs clients include <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/07/07/leaked-documents-confirm-hacking-team-sells-spyware-repressive-countries/">foreign governments with troubling human rights records</a>). This specific firmware made sure that Windows was always infected with malware. If youâre a target of a Hacking Team customer, even formatting your disk and re-installing Windows would not remove the malware. As soon as you reboot, the malicious BIOS firmware would re-infect the freshly installed Windows with the same malware again.</p>

<p class="caption">Trying to dump BIOS firmware directly from the SPI flash chip by wiring it to a BeagleBone Black, a small and cheap external computer.</p>
<p class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Micah Lee</p></div>
<p><b>An attacker could do other things to your hardware.</b> Tampering with unencrypted data on your hard disk, or replacing your BIOS firmware with malware, are the most straightforward types of evil maid attacks, but the list of other potential attacks is only limited by the attackerâs creativity and budget.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>An attacker could potentially figure out a way of spying on your computer use by replacing firmware on other components of your computer besides your BIOS, like your processor, video card, network card, or hard disk.</li>
<li>An attacker could install a hardware keylogger (they would plug your internal keyboard into the keylogger, then plug the keylogger into the motherboard) with the intention of stealing your laptop later, but with a record of your disk passphrase and your other keystrokes.</li>
<li>An attacker could completely replace your laptop with a different laptop of the same model â they could even put your real laptop case with all your stickers and scratches on the fake laptop, so that it looks exactly the same. When you type your passphrase into this one though, it could send that passphrase over the internet to the attacker, who could then use it to unlock your real disk.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I decided to start this honeypot laptop project, I realized early on that I couldnât possibly detect every form of tampering. Because tampering with the data on the hard disk or the BIOS firmware are the simplest and cheapest types of evil maid attacks to conduct, and because attackers have limited resources and prefer low-hanging fruit when itâs available, I decided to limit my detection to these two components. But who knows? Itâs possible that my honeypot laptop has a malicious component in it that I never checked for.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>In February 2016, shortly before I was planning to fly to Spain for the <a href="https://internetfreedomfestival.org/">Internet Freedom Festival</a>, I bought a Lenovo IdeaPad S210 Touch for about $700 to use as my honeypot laptop.</p>
<p>Here was the plan. Before each trip, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update all of the software on my honeypot laptop. (I wanted potential attackers to see that Iâm using up-to-date bootloader software stored on the small unencrypted part of my disk, to believe that I actively use this computer.)</li>
<li>Power off the laptop, and donât power it on again until the trip was over. (Just by powering on the computer, I risk slightly modifying data in my BIOS and hard disk.)</li>
<li>Remove the hard disk from the laptop, attach it to an external USB enclosure, and plug it into another computer, taking care not to modify any data on it. From there, I could make a record of the state of the disk.</li>
<li>Attach a <a href="https://beagleboard.org/black">BeagleBone Black</a>,Â or BBB, a tiny $50 computer thatâs great for hardware hacking, to the SPI flash chip on the motherboard and use it to dump the BIOS firmware, saving an exact copy of the data stored on the chip.</li>
<li>Re-assemble the computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, during the trip, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the honeypot laptop in my checked luggage.</li>
<li>Leave the honeypot laptop unattended in my hotel room.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I returned home from a trip, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the hard disk from the laptop, plug it into another computer, and record the state of the disk again. If even a single bit of data on the disk has changed, I could detect it.</li>
<li>Attach the BBB to the SPI flash chip and dump the BIOS firmware again. I could then compare the firmware image I took from before my trip with the image I took after it, to detect if it was tampered with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way, I planned to document everything: Iâd take photos of my laptop in my luggage, in hotels, and of the cards that TSA leaves informing me that they searched my luggage; Iâd keep a log of the state of my hard disk and BIOS before and after each trip; and Iâd keep a journal that includes all technical hurdles I ran into.</p>
<p>This is <i>mostly</i> how it went down, but I did run into a few snags. Bear with me, in the following sections I venture much deeper into the technical weeds than I already have.</p>
<h3>Checking the Hard Disk for Tampering</h3>
<p>Before I proceed, there a few concepts I need to explain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer drives, whether disk- or flash- based, are organized into separate âpartitions.â For example, if you install Linux with disk encryption, your drive will likely have two partitions: a small (often less thanÂ 1 gigabyte) unencrypted partition called â/bootâ â this is where the program that asks for your encryption passphrase is stored, and where evil maids might put their malware â and the rest of the disk will contain a large encrypted partition. After you unlock the encrypted partition with the right passphrase, it will likely contain two other partitions inside, a â/â or ârootâ partition that holds the rest of the files on the computer, and a âswapâ partition thatâs only used when the computer is running low on memory. (I refer to both flash- and disk- based storage drives as âdisksâ and âhard disks.â)</li>
<li>There is a small amount of disk space at the beginning of every hard disk (which I call the disk header) thatâs reserved for a bootloader program. When you power on a computer and boot from your hard disk, you run this program. In Linux, this program simply starts running another program called âgrubâ thatâs stored in your unencrypted â/bootâ partition. Grub is responsible for actually booting your operating system. In order to detect evil maid attacks, itâs important to make sure the disk header was not tampered with.</li>
<li>In cryptography, a âhash functionâ is a one-way functionÂ that takes an input of any size and outputs a fixed-size result called a âhashâ or âchecksum.â For example, with SHA256, the hash function I use in this project, whether your input is 5 bytes long (the size of the word âhelloâ) or 512 gigabytes long (the size of a hard disk), the output will always be 32 bytes long. The same input will always lead to the same output, but if you change the input in <i>any way</i>, even if only a single byte is different, the content of the output will be entirely different (although the length will be the same). You can use checksums to detect tampering.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I started this project, I decided to dual-boot Windows 10 and <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, a popular Linux distribution, on my honeypot laptop â that is, I installed both operating systems in different partitions on the same disk, and when I powered on the computer, I got to choose which to boot to. But due to various time-consuming and annoying issues related to Windows updates, I eventually chose to abandon Windows altogether and just run Debian on my honeypot laptop, which made my job of detecting hard disk tampering simpler.</p>
<p>Before each trip, I removed the disk from the honeypot laptop, plugged it into a USB enclosure, and then plugged the USB disk enclosure into a different computer. The first snag I ran into was that when I plugged in the USB disk, my computer automatically tried to mount the partitions. This isnât good â just by mounting the partitions, I risked modifying the data. So I changed the settings on my computer (which was running Linux) to disable automatically mounting external drives by following <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/20107">these instructions</a>.</p>
<p><div class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> <a href="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/IMG_0545-1524598450.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-184832" src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/IMG_0545-1524598450.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=1024&h=768" alt="" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Hard disk from the honeypot laptop, removed and plugged into a cheap external USB enclosureÂ that can be plugged into a separate computer.</p>
<p class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Micah Lee</p></div>Once the USB disk enclosure was attached to a computer other than the honeypot, I could generate checksums of all of the diskâs partitions, as well as the disk header, using a tool called <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSHA256SUM">sha256sum</a>. In order to take a checksum of just the disk header, I used a tool called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)">dd</a> to copy the disk header into a file, and then used sha256sum to take a checksum of that file.</p>
<p>When I returned home from my trip, I repeated the same process to generate a new set of checksums. Finally, I compared the checksums from before my trip with the checksums from after my trip. If the checksums were not the same, then the data on the disk must have changed â this would be evidence of tampering. If I discovered this, I could then start looking into exactly what data had changed to discover how the tampering worked.</p>
<p>For example, in March 2017, before flying to Amsterdam to attend a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a> meeting with developers, volunteers, and advocates for the open-source anonymity network, these were the checksums I generated:</p>
<pre>4040239f4f0a2090c3ca15216b6e42522c4c3cd291f2c78f3c9e815f25be8295 disk_header
ed6e8a3438e55d2aeae4ae691823c4005f7b5df0b62d856bd72d54fa00d886bb /dev/xvdi1
db3d92ed1cfa8621e5673da32100d9117a3835c06a613cf9ac0f2f90de404d17 extended_header
cbeb585b6fa39a8425f57fa095ac17353a583bccd93532d65d9274da628a4c72 luks_header</pre>
<p>Ten days later, after I had returned from my trip, I generated another set of checksums. They all turned out to be exactly the same, which allowed me to confirm that the data on my hard disk had not changed at all.</p>
<h3>Checking the BIOS for Tampering</h3>
<p>When I started this project, I intended to dump BIOS firmware images externally using a BeagleBone Black (explained previously) and a software tool called <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/Flashrom">flashrom</a>, which is used for reading and writing data thatâs stored on physical chips on circuit boards, roughly following the <a href="https://libreboot.org/docs/install/bbb_setup.html">instructions outlined here</a>. But I quickly hit a snag, one that I didnât have the tools or knowledge of electronics to easily resolve.</p>
<p>The SPI flash chip that holds my honeypot laptopâs BIOS firmware has a pin for power and another pin for ground. With the laptop powered off, I connected the power and ground pins to my BBB, and then powered on the BBB.</p>
<p>I had hoped that the BBB would provide power to the SPI flash chip, allowing me to read and write directly to that chip. But instead the BBB immediately powered off. It turns out that, the way this specific laptop was wired, the power for the SPI chip was not isolated from the rest of the system. In order to provide power to that chip, I also needed to provide power to rest of the components of the motherboard, and that takes more watts than my BBB was able to handle. This was annoying because one of the reasons I chose a Lenovo computer as my honeypot laptop is because I have had success doing this exact process on other Lenovo computers in the past, dumping the BIOS firmware by connecting a BBB to the SPI flash chip.</p>
<p>So I decided to change strategies. Instead of dumping the BIOS firmware by connecting wires directly from the SPI flash chip, I would instead use a piece of software called <a href="https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec">chipsec</a>, running on the honeypot laptop itself, to dump the firmware. However, this strategy has a few downsides compared to directly connecting to the chip:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to run chipsec, I needed to first power on the honeypot laptop and boot to an operating system. It turns out that this process, booting up the computer, slightly modifies the data stored in the BIOS firmware, which makes it more difficult to check for tampering.</li>
<li>Itâs impossible to get a complete BIOS dump from within an operating system, but you can get most of it.</li>
<li>When I dump BIOS firmware using chipsec, it may be possible for sophisticated BIOS malware to lie to chipsec, which could be used to prevent detection. (I have never heard of BIOS malware that actually does this, though.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to use chipsec, I set up a USB stick with the operating system <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu</a> (another popular Linux distribution). With the hard disk removed from the honeypot laptop, I plugged in my Ubuntu USB stick, powered on the laptop, and booted to Ubuntu. I put a copy of chipsec on an SD memory card, which I also plugged into the laptop. From there, I was able to run a specific chipsec command to dump the BIOS firmware and save it to the SD card, which I could then inspect on my other computer.</p>
<p><div class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> <a href="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_chipsec-1524598486.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-184833" src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_chipsec-1524598486.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=1024&h=576" alt="honeypot_chipsec-1524598486" /></a></p>
<p class="caption overlayed">Dumping the BIOS firmware using chipsec.</p>
</div>Here is the <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/2e3263fa904729c3c4d416b7ee8d7cec21500a4c50f33a348140003aeef988e7/analysis/1456336870/">VirusTotal report</a> from the first BIOS firmware image that I dumped using chipsec from my honeypot laptop.</p>
<p>Once I successfully managed to dump the BIOS firmware, I came up with this plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before each trip, I would remove the hard disk from the laptop, boot to the Ubuntu USB stick, and dump the BIOS firmware, making sure to save a copy of it on my other computer.</li>
<li>After I return from the trip, I would repeat the process, dumping a fresh BIOS firmware image.</li>
<li>Then I would generate checksums of the BIOS firmware images from before and after my trip. If the checksums were exactly the same, I could confirm that my BIOS was not tampered with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it wasnât this simple. It turns out, <i>every time</i> I booted my honeypot laptop to an Ubuntu live USB stick and dumped the BIOS firmware, that firmware image had a different checksum than the previous one. In order to investigate what was going on, I used a program called <a href="https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool">UEFITool</a>. This is a graphical program that lets you load BIOS images, view and edit what data is stored inside, and extract data into separate files.</p>
<p><div class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1000px;'> <a href="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_uefitool-1524598511.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90"><img class="aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-184834" src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_uefitool-1524598511.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=1000&h=796" alt="honeypot_uefitool-1524598511" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Inspecting BIOS firmware using UEFITool.</p>
</div>For this specific laptop, each BIOS firmware image is exactly 4 megabytes. Some of that space is used to store the actual programs that make up the BIOS (an evil maid attacker would replace these programs with malicious versions), and some of it is used to store other data, such as saved BIOS settings.</p>
<p>Looking at two BIOS firmware images that had different checksums, I was able to use UEFITool to extract the same components from both, and then generate new checksums for those individual components to see if they matched. I discovered that there was only one small part of the firmware images that differed, and that part did not include any programs. It turns out, each time I powered on the honeypot laptop and opened the boot menu to tell it to boot from my Ubuntu USB stick, it saved information related to booting to a USB stick in that section of the firmware, and this information was slightly different each time, which caused the firmware images to always have different checksums.</p>
<p>So I amended my plan for detecting tampering in the BIOS firmware. To compare firmware images from before and after my trip, I would have to open each image in UEFITool, extract all of the components except for the one that I knew changed, generate checksums for those components, and then compare <i>those</i> checksums to make sure they matched.</p>
<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>Traveling with a honeypot laptop was a lot of work. It required spending a few hours both before and after each trip if I hoped to actually catch an evil maid attacker in the act. So after two years without catching anyone, I have decided to retire the project.</p>
<p>A tool exists today, that didnât exist when I started the project, that makes it possible to catch evil maid attackers in the act in a different way. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/snowdens-new-app-uses-your-smartphone-to-physically-guard-your-laptop/">Haven</a> is an Android app, designed to run on a spare phone that you leave in your hotel room while youâre away, perhaps sitting on top of your laptop. It uses all of its sensors â microphone, motion detector, light detector, and cameras â to monitor the room for changes, logs everything it notices, and can send Signal notifications to the phone you carry with you when it detects a change. Haven isnât perfect â there are plenty of false positives â but it gets better all the time and is still likely to catch anyone attempting to tamper with the laptop thatâs sitting under the phone Haven is running on.</p>
<p>I was able to do this entire project with 100% free and open source software, thanks to projects like Debian and Ubuntu and tools like dd, sha256sum, flashrom, chipsec, and UEFITool. Other than the honeypot laptop itself, you can buy all of the hardware tools I used, like screwdrivers, a USB enclosure, and a BeagleBone Black, for less than $100.</p>

So while itâs definitely possible to detect certain types of tampering, it isnât always trivial. And even in controlled environments, itâs impossible to give a laptop a clean bill of health with full confidence â itâs always possible that it was tampered with in a way you did not think to check.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The issue of tampering is particularly relevant for human rights workers, activists, journalists, and software developers, all of whom hold sensitive data sought by powerful potential attackers. People in these vocations are often keenly aware of the security of their laptops while traveling â after all, laptops store critical secrets like communication with sources, lists of contacts, password databases, and encryption keys used to vouch for source code you write, or to give you access to remote servers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\">\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>How safe is it to leave your laptop in your hotel room while youâre attending sessions at a conference? If you come back to find your laptop in a different position than where you thought you left it, can you still trust it? Did someone tamper with it, did a hotel housekeeper simply straighten up the items you left on your desk, or did you misremember where you left it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These questions typically canât be answered with total confidence because clever tampering can be so hard to detect. But I hoped I could get a sense of the risks with a carefully controlled experiment. For the last two years, I have carried a âhoneypotâ laptop with me every time I&#8217;ve traveled; this computer was intended to attract (and then detect) tampering. If any hackers, state-sponsored or otherwise, wanted to hack me by physically messing with my computer, I wanted to not only catch them in the act, but also gather technical evidence that I could use to learn how their attack worked and, hopefully, who the attacker was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While traveling by air, I checked this laptop in my luggage to make it easily accessible to border agents, both domestic and foreign, to tamper with if they chose to. When staying in hotels, I left the laptop sitting on the desk in my room while I was away during the day, to make sure that any malicious housekeepers with permission to enter my room, or anyone else who broke into my room, was free to tamper with it if they chose to. I also put a bunch of hacker stickers all over it, hoping that this would make it a more enticing target.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-right  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/IMG_1651-1524597624.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-article-medium wp-image-184827\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/IMG_1651-1524597624-540x1023.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1651-1524597624\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">A ânotice of baggage inspectionâ from TSA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Micah Lee\u003c/p>\u003c/div>Over the duration of this experiment, I traveled to Europe three times and domestically in the United States five times (including once to Puerto Rico). I found eight different notices from the Transportation Security Administration informing me that my baggageÂ had been searched. I have no way of knowing how many times itÂ had been searched by other authorities who werenât kind enough to leave me a note.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I never caught anyone tampering with this laptop. But the absence of any evidence of tampering â and my obsessive thoughts about the various ways an attacker could have evaded by detection â serve to underline how fraught the process of computer forensics can be. If someone who makes their living securing computers thinks they could have missed a computer infection, what hope is there for the average computer user?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the end of my experiment, I thought through all of the things that could have gone wrong. Perhaps someone did tamper with my honeypot laptop, and my methodology for detecting this wasnât thorough enough to notice. Or maybe potential attackers noticed that the laptop I carried with me and used at the conferences I was attending was different than the one I left in my room, and decided against tampering with it in case it was a trap.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the most likely reason I didnât catch any attackers is that no one tried to tamper with my laptop. Hacking a targetâs laptop by physically tampering with it while theyâre traveling probably happens only rarely because itâs so expensive â it may require travel, physical surveillance, breaking and entering, and the risk of getting caught or breaking the laptop is high. Compare this to cheap forms of hacking like email phishing: You can target thousands of people at once from the comfort of your office, and the risk of getting caught is much lower.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, I believe actively checking devices for tampering is worthwhile. Youâll never catch an attacker in the act if you never look for evidence of their attacks. And just looking for evidence, even if you donât find any, increases costs for attackers: If they want to be sure you wonât notice, theyâre going to have to get more creative. I believe itâs useful to explain the technology and the methodology I came up with to detect tampering and share what I learned from the experience. Doing so gives a taste of just how many ways there are to tamper with a laptop.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class=\"photo-grid\" data-caption=\"Photos of the honeypot laptop on the desk in several different hotel rooms.\" data-columns=\"2\" data-credit=\"Photos: Micah Lee\" data-photos=\"%5B%7B%22alt%22%3A%22%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2018%5C%2F04%5C%2Fgrid-1-1524594527-1024x768.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22alt%22%3A%22Maker%3AS%2CDate%3A2017-8-11%2CVer%3A6%2CLens%3AKan03%2CAct%3ALar02%2CE-Y%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2018%5C%2F04%5C%2Fgrid-3-1524594530-1024x768.jpg%22%7D%5D\" data-size=\"xtra-large\">\u003c/div>\n\u003ch3>Evil Maid Attacks\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>If you donât \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/04/27/encrypting-laptop-like-mean/\">use full disk encryption\u003c/a> on your laptop, anyone who gains physical access to it, even for just a few minutes, can access all of your data and even implant malware on your computer to spy on you in the future. It doesnât matter how good your password is because without encryption, the attacker can simply unscrew the case on your laptop, remove your hard disk, and access it from another computer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Disk encryption does a great job of protecting your data in case you lose your laptop or someone steals it from you. When this person tries accessing your data, they should be completely locked out, so long as the passphrase you use to unlock your laptop is \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/\">strong enough\u003c/a> that they canât guess it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But there is a sneaky class of attack, called âevil maidâ attacks, that disk encryption alone cannot protect against. Evil maid attacks work like this: An attacker (such as a malicious hotel housekeeper, for example) gains temporary access to your encrypted laptop. Although they canât decrypt your data, they can spend a few minutes tampering with your laptop and then leave it exactly where they found it. When you come back and type in your credentials, \u003ci>now\u003c/i> you have been hacked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Exactly how an evil maid attack would work against your laptop depends on many factors: the type of computer you use, what operating system you use, which disk encryption software you use, and the configuration of firmware used to boot your computer, firmware which Iâll call âBIOS,â although it can also go by acronyms like EFI and UEFI. Some computers have considerably better technology to prevent evil maid attacks than others â for example, attackers have to do more advanced tampering to hack a Windows laptop encrypted with BitLocker than they do to hack a Mac laptop encrypted with FileVault (\u003ca href=\"https://twocanoes.com/secureboot-imac-pro/\">as of now\u003c/a>, anyway) or a Linux laptop encrypted with LUKS.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'>\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/IMG_0538-1524597859.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184829\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/IMG_0538-1524597859-1024x698.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">The honeypot laptop I used, with red boxes around the hard disk and the SPI flash chip that stores the BIOS firmware.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Micah Lee\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cbr />\nHere are the main ways that an attacker could physically tamper with your laptop:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>An attacker could modify data on your hard disk.\u003c/b> âFull disk encryption,â the term used to refer generically to systems like FileVault, really ought to be called ânearly full disk encryptionâ because, except in a few specific circumstances, thereâs always a small part of a computerâs disk that isnât encrypted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When you power on your laptop, before your disk has been unlocked, your computer loads a program from this unencrypted part of your disk; it then runs the program, and the program asks you to enter your passphrase. The program converts your passphrase into an encryption key and tries to use it to unlock the disk. If you typed the correct passphrase, the disk unlocks, and the rest of the operating system (which is stored in the encrypted part of the disk) boots up. If you donât know the right passphrase, there is no way to unlock the disk.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But since the program that asks for your passphrase isnât encrypted, itâs possible for an attacker that physically has your laptop to replace it with a malicious version that looks exactly the same to the user, but that takes extra steps. For example, after you successfully unlock your disk, it might copy malware onto it that, after the computer finishes booting up, automatically runs in the background, spying on what youâre doing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Computers that support âsecure bootâ or âverified boot,â such as Chromebooks and Windows laptops with BitLocker, arenât vulnerable to this. The BIOS can detect if the unencrypted part of your disk has been tampered with, and if it has, it will refuse to boot. MacBooks and laptops that run Linux could potentially be attacked in this way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>An attacker could replace your BIOS firmware with malicious firmware.\u003c/b> When you power on your computer, the very first program that your computer runs is your BIOS firmware. The job of this program is to initialize all of your hardware â your memory, disks, Wi-Fi adapter, video card, USB ports, and everything else â and then ultimately boot an operating system, typically the one stored on your hard disk.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When you format your disk and install a new operating system on your computer, your BIOS firmware doesnât change. This is because this program isnât stored on your hard disk at all. Instead, itâs stored in a small chip on your computerâs motherboard called an SPI flash chip.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is why BIOS malware is so stealthy â you canât get rid of it by formatting your hard disk, and it can spy on you across operating systems, such as if you boot to a \u003ca href=\"https://tails.boum.org/\">Tails\u003c/a> USB stick.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>SPI flash chips have eight pins, including one for providing the chip with power, one for reading data, and one for writing data to the chip. This means that itâs possible for an attacker to power off your laptop, open up the case, and attach their own wires to the SPI flash chip pins in order to power it on, and then read and write data to it (the chip itself has no way of telling the difference between this, or just being part of the normal computer). Using this technique, an attacker with physical access to your laptop can replace your BIOS firmware with whatever malware they want.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Italian spyware firm Hacking Team was caught \u003ca href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-uses-uefi-bios-rootkit-to-keep-rcs-9-agent-in-target-systems/\">selling such BIOS malware\u003c/a> to its customers (the companyâs clients include \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/07/07/leaked-documents-confirm-hacking-team-sells-spyware-repressive-countries/\">foreign governments with troubling human rights records\u003c/a>). This specific firmware made sure that Windows was always infected with malware. If youâre a target of a Hacking Team customer, even formatting your disk and re-installing Windows would not remove the malware. As soon as you reboot, the malicious BIOS firmware would re-infect the freshly installed Windows with the same malware again.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_bios_flash-1524598249.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184830\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_bios_flash-1524598249-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Trying to dump BIOS firmware directly from the SPI flash chip by wiring it to a BeagleBone Black, a small and cheap external computer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Micah Lee\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>An attacker could do other things to your hardware.\u003c/b> Tampering with unencrypted data on your hard disk, or replacing your BIOS firmware with malware, are the most straightforward types of evil maid attacks, but the list of other potential attacks is only limited by the attackerâs creativity and budget.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Here are a few examples:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>An attacker could potentially figure out a way of spying on your computer use by replacing firmware on other components of your computer besides your BIOS, like your processor, video card, network card, or hard disk.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>An attacker could install a hardware keylogger (they would plug your internal keyboard into the keylogger, then plug the keylogger into the motherboard) with the intention of stealing your laptop later, but with a record of your disk passphrase and your other keystrokes.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>An attacker could completely replace your laptop with a different laptop of the same model â they could even put your real laptop case with all your stickers and scratches on the fake laptop, so that it looks exactly the same.

Bear with me, in the following sections I venture much deeper into the technical weeds than I already have.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Checking the Hard Disk for Tampering\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Before I proceed, there a few concepts I need to explain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>Computer drives, whether disk- or flash- based, are organized into separate âpartitions.â For example, if you install Linux with disk encryption, your drive will likely have two partitions: a small (often less thanÂ 1 gigabyte) unencrypted partition called â/bootâ â this is where the program that asks for your encryption passphrase is stored, and where evil maids might put their malware â and the rest of the disk will contain a large encrypted partition. After you unlock the encrypted partition with the right passphrase, it will likely contain two other partitions inside, a â/â or ârootâ partition that holds the rest of the files on the computer, and a âswapâ partition thatâs only used when the computer is running low on memory. (I refer to both flash- and disk- based storage drives as âdisksâ and âhard disks.â)\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>There is a small amount of disk space at the beginning of every hard disk (which I call the disk header) thatâs reserved for a bootloader program. When you power on a computer and boot from your hard disk, you run this program. In Linux, this program simply starts running another program called âgrubâ thatâs stored in your unencrypted â/bootâ partition. Grub is responsible for actually booting your operating system. In order to detect evil maid attacks, itâs important to make sure the disk header was not tampered with.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>In cryptography, a âhash functionâ is a one-way functionÂ that takes an input of any size and outputs a fixed-size result called a âhashâ or âchecksum.â For example, with SHA256, the hash function I use in this project, whether your input is 5 bytes long (the size of the word âhelloâ) or 512 gigabytes long (the size of a hard disk), the output will always be 32 bytes long. The same input will always lead to the same output, but if you change the input in \u003ci>any way\u003c/i>, even if only a single byte is different, the content of the output will be entirely different (although the length will be the same). You can use checksums to detect tampering.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>When I started this project, I decided to dual-boot Windows 10 and \u003ca href=\"https://www.debian.org/\">Debian\u003c/a>, a popular Linux distribution, on my honeypot laptop â that is, I installed both operating systems in different partitions on the same disk, and when I powered on the computer, I got to choose which to boot to. But due to various time-consuming and annoying issues related to Windows updates, I eventually chose to abandon Windows altogether and just run Debian on my honeypot laptop, which made my job of detecting hard disk tampering simpler.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Before each trip, I removed the disk from the honeypot laptop, plugged it into a USB enclosure, and then plugged the USB disk enclosure into a different computer. The first snag I ran into was that when I plugged in the USB disk, my computer automatically tried to mount the partitions. This isnât good â just by mounting the partitions, I risked modifying the data. So I changed the settings on my computer (which was running Linux) to disable automatically mounting external drives by following \u003ca href=\"https://access.redhat.com/solutions/20107\">these instructions\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/IMG_0545-1524598450.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184832\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/IMG_0545-1524598450-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Hard disk from the honeypot laptop, removed and plugged into a cheap external USB enclosureÂ that can be plugged into a separate computer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Micah Lee\u003c/p>\u003c/div>Once the USB disk enclosure was attached to a computer other than the honeypot, I could generate checksums of all of the diskâs partitions, as well as the disk header, using a tool called \u003ca href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSHA256SUM\">sha256sum\u003c/a>. In order to take a checksum of just the disk header, I used a tool called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)\">dd\u003c/a> to copy the disk header into a file, and then used sha256sum to take a checksum of that file.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When I returned home from my trip, I repeated the same process to generate a new set of checksums. Finally, I compared the checksums from before my trip with the checksums from after my trip. If the checksums were not the same, then the data on the disk must have changed â this would be evidence of tampering. If I discovered this, I could then start looking into exactly what data had changed to discover how the tampering worked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For example, in March 2017, before flying to Amsterdam to attend a \u003ca href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor Project\u003c/a> meeting with developers, volunteers, and advocates for the open-source anonymity network, these were the checksums I generated:\u003c/p>\n\u003cpre>4040239f4f0a2090c3ca15216b6e42522c4c3cd291f2c78f3c9e815f25be8295 disk_header\r\ned6e8a3438e55d2aeae4ae691823c4005f7b5df0b62d856bd72d54fa00d886bb /dev/xvdi1\r\ndb3d92ed1cfa8621e5673da32100d9117a3835c06a613cf9ac0f2f90de404d17 extended_header\r\ncbeb585b6fa39a8425f57fa095ac17353a583bccd93532d65d9274da628a4c72 luks_header\u003c/pre>\n\u003cp>Ten days later, after I had returned from my trip, I generated another set of checksums. They all turned out to be exactly the same, which allowed me to confirm that the data on my hard disk had not changed at all.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Checking the BIOS for Tampering\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>When I started this project, I intended to dump BIOS firmware images externally using a BeagleBone Black (explained previously) and a software tool called \u003ca href=\"https://www.flashrom.org/Flashrom\">flashrom\u003c/a>, which is used for reading and writing data thatâs stored on physical chips on circuit boards, roughly following the \u003ca href=\"https://libreboot.org/docs/install/bbb_setup.html\">instructions outlined here\u003c/a>. But I quickly hit a snag, one that I didnât have the tools or knowledge of electronics to easily resolve.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The SPI flash chip that holds my honeypot laptopâs BIOS firmware has a pin for power and another pin for ground. With the laptop powered off, I connected the power and ground pins to my BBB, and then powered on the BBB.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I had hoped that the BBB would provide power to the SPI flash chip, allowing me to read and write directly to that chip. But instead the BBB immediately powered off. It turns out that, the way this specific laptop was wired, the power for the SPI chip was not isolated from the rest of the system. In order to provide power to that chip, I also needed to provide power to rest of the components of the motherboard, and that takes more watts than my BBB was able to handle. This was annoying because one of the reasons I chose a Lenovo computer as my honeypot laptop is because I have had success doing this exact process on other Lenovo computers in the past, dumping the BIOS firmware by connecting a BBB to the SPI flash chip.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So I decided to change strategies. Instead of dumping the BIOS firmware by connecting wires directly from the SPI flash chip, I would instead use a piece of software called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec\">chipsec\u003c/a>, running on the honeypot laptop itself, to dump the firmware. However, this strategy has a few downsides compared to directly connecting to the chip:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>In order to run chipsec, I needed to first power on the honeypot laptop and boot to an operating system. It turns out that this process, booting up the computer, slightly modifies the data stored in the BIOS firmware, which makes it more difficult to check for tampering.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Itâs impossible to get a complete BIOS dump from within an operating system, but you can get most of it.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>When I dump BIOS firmware using chipsec, it may be possible for sophisticated BIOS malware to lie to chipsec, which could be used to prevent detection. (I have never heard of BIOS malware that actually does this, though.)\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>In order to use chipsec, I set up a USB stick with the operating system \u003ca href=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop\">Ubuntu\u003c/a> (another popular Linux distribution). With the hard disk removed from the honeypot laptop, I plugged in my Ubuntu USB stick, powered on the laptop, and booted to Ubuntu. I put a copy of chipsec on an SD memory card, which I also plugged into the laptop. From there, I was able to run a specific chipsec command to dump the BIOS firmware and save it to the SD card, which I could then inspect on my other computer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_chipsec-1524598486.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184833\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_chipsec-1524598486-1024x576.png\" alt=\"honeypot_chipsec-1524598486\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\">Dumping the BIOS firmware using chipsec.\u003c/p>\n\u003c/div>Here is the \u003ca href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/2e3263fa904729c3c4d416b7ee8d7cec21500a4c50f33a348140003aeef988e7/analysis/1456336870/\">VirusTotal report\u003c/a> from the first BIOS firmware image that I dumped using chipsec from my honeypot laptop.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once I successfully managed to dump the BIOS firmware, I came up with this plan:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>Before each trip, I would remove the hard disk from the laptop, boot to the Ubuntu USB stick, and dump the BIOS firmware, making sure to save a copy of it on my other computer.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>After I return from the trip, I would repeat the process, dumping a fresh BIOS firmware image.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Then I would generate checksums of the BIOS firmware images from before and after my trip. If the checksums were exactly the same, I could confirm that my BIOS was not tampered with.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>Of course, it wasnât this simple. It turns out, \u003ci>every time\u003c/i> I booted my honeypot laptop to an Ubuntu live USB stick and dumped the BIOS firmware, that firmware image had a different checksum than the previous one. In order to investigate what was going on, I used a program called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool\">UEFITool\u003c/a>. This is a graphical program that lets you load BIOS images, view and edit what data is stored inside, and extract data into separate files.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1000px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_uefitool-1524598511.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-184834\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/honeypot_uefitool-1524598511-1000x796.jpg\" alt=\"honeypot_uefitool-1524598511\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Inspecting BIOS firmware using UEFITool.\u003c/p>\n\u003c/div>For this specific laptop, each BIOS firmware image is exactly 4 megabytes. Some of that space is used to store the actual programs that make up the BIOS (an evil maid attacker would replace these programs with malicious versions), and some of it is used to store other data, such as saved BIOS settings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Looking at two BIOS firmware images that had different checksums, I was able to use UEFITool to extract the same components from both, and then generate new checksums for those individual components to see if they matched. I discovered that there was only one small part of the firmware images that differed, and that part did not include any programs. It turns out, each time I powered on the honeypot laptop and opened the boot menu to tell it to boot from my Ubuntu USB stick, it saved information related to booting to a USB stick in that section of the firmware, and this information was slightly different each time, which caused the firmware images to always have different checksums.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So I amended my plan for detecting tampering in the BIOS firmware. To compare firmware images from before and after my trip, I would have to open each image in UEFITool, extract all of the components except for the one that I knew changed, generate checksums for those components, and then compare \u003ci>those\u003c/i> checksums to make sure they matched.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>What I Learned\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Traveling with a honeypot laptop was a lot of work. It required spending a few hours both before and after each trip if I hoped to actually catch an evil maid attacker in the act. So after two years without catching anyone, I have decided to retire the project.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A tool exists today, that didnât exist when I started the project, that makes it possible to catch evil maid attackers in the act in a different way. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/22/snowdens-new-app-uses-your-smartphone-to-physically-guard-your-laptop/\">Haven\u003c/a> is an Android app, designed to run on a spare phone that you leave in your hotel room while youâre away, perhaps sitting on top of your laptop. It uses all of its sensors â microphone, motion detector, light detector, and cameras â to monitor the room for changes, logs everything it notices, and can send Signal notifications to the phone you carry with you when it detects a change. Haven isnât perfect â there are plenty of false positives â but it gets better all the time and is still likely to catch anyone attempting to tamper with the laptop thatâs sitting under the phone Haven is running on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I was able to do this entire project with 100% free and open source software, thanks to projects like Debian and Ubuntu and tools like dd, sha256sum, flashrom, chipsec, and UEFITool. Other than the honeypot laptop itself, you can buy all of the hardware tools I used, like screwdrivers, a USB enclosure, and a BeagleBone Black, for less than $100.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: Honeypot laptop in the luggage.\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2018-04-28T14:00:26+00:00","date_local":"2018-04-28T10:00:26+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"I spent two years trying to get someone to tamper with my laptop, so I could then detect it.

class='dropcap'>F</span><u>azliddin Kurbanov is</u> a barrel-chested man from Uzbekistan who came to the United States in 2009, when he was in his late 20s. A Christian who had converted from Islam, Kurbanov arrived as a refugee and spoke little English. Resettled in Boise, Idaho, he rented an apartment, worked odd jobs, and was studying to be a truck driver.</p>
<p>But about three years after entering the U.S., around the time he converted back to Islam, Kurbanov was placed under FBI surveillance. According to emails and internet chat logs obtained by the government, Kurbanov was disgusted by having seen Americans burn the Quran and by reports that an American soldier had tried to rape a Muslim girl. âMy entire life, everything, changed,â Kurbanov wrote in a July 31, 2012 email.</p>
<p>After the FBI assigned one informant to live with him and another informant to attend his truck-driving school, Kurbanov was arrested in May 2013. Prosecutors accused him of providing material support to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and possessing bomb-making materials.</p>
<p>During Kurbanov&#8217;s trial, the government notified him that his conversations with an alleged Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan associate based in Pakistan had been intercepted. The spying, federal prosecutors said, had been authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which regulates the monitoring of agents of foreign governments and terrorist organizations. Kurbanov was convicted at trial and sentenced to 25 years in prison, after which heâll be deported to Uzbekistan. He is an apparent success story for U.S. counterterrorism officials. If there was any doubt about Kurbanov&#8217;s propensity for violence, he eliminated it by stabbing a prison warden in California, an act for which he is now facing additional charges.</p>
<p>But Justice Department lawyers gained their conviction against Kurbanov after failing to disclose a legally significant fact: Kurbanovâs conversations with his alleged terrorist associate had been captured through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">PRISM</a>, a National Security Agency mass surveillance program whose existence was revealed in documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Under PRISM, the government obtains communications directly from at least eight large technology companies without the need for warrants, a type of practice authorized in 2008, when Congress provided new surveillance powers under FISA.</p>
<blockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>The government must disclose when information against defendants originates from warrantless surveillance â but prosecutors did not do so to Kurbanov.</blockquote>
<p>While traditional FISA authority permits spying on a particular person or group through warrants issued by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, under the new powers, codified in FISA Section 702, monitoring is approved inÂ bulk by the court through what is essentially a recipe for mass surveillance. Once approved, such a recipe can be used against thousands of targets. Under Section 702 authority, the NSA is currently monitoring digital communications of more than 100,000 people; it swept up an estimated 250 million internet communications each year as of a <a href="https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/NS-DC-0057-0002.pdf">2011 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinion</a>. The FBI frequently searches Section 702 databases when it opens national security and domestic criminal &#8220;assessments,&#8221; precursors to full investigations.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/sso-weekly-brief-25-april-2013-excerpt">a slide in an NSA presentation</a>, provided by Snowden and published for the first time today by The Intercept, the interception of Kurbanovâs conversations was a âReporting Highlightâ for PRISM. The document indicates that the NSA captured Kurbanovâs Skype conversations from October 2012 through April 2013, roughly the same period the FBI was investigating him with undercover informants. It further details how an NSA unit in April 2013 issued a report describing âhow Kurbanov believed he was under surveillance (which he is by the FBI) but was cautiously continuing his work, which was not specified â could be raising money for the IMU or explosive testing.â The alleged terrorist associate with whom Kurbanov was communicating âwanted Kurbanov to set this work in motion, probably related to sending money back to the IMU,â the document added.</p>

<p>The government is obligated to disclose to criminal defendants when information against them originates from Section 702 reporting, but federal prosecutors did not do so in Kurbanovâs case. In fact, when Kurbanovâs lawyers demanded disclosure of FISA-related evidence and the suppression of that evidence, Attorney General Eric Holder asserted national security privilege, claiming in a declaration that disclosure of FISA information would âharm the national security of the United States.â Kurbanovâs lawyer, Chuck Peterson, declined to comment about the governmentâs use of Section 702 surveillance against his client.</p>
<p>Kurbanov does not appear to be the only defendant kept in the dark about how warrantless surveillance was used against him. A nationwide review of federal court records by The Intercept found that of 75 terrorism defendants notified of some type of FISA spying since Section 702 became law, just 10 received notice of Section 702 surveillance. And yet Section 702 was credited with âwell over 100 arrests on terrorism-related offensesâ in a July 2014 <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf">report</a> from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the federal entity created to oversee intelligence authorities granted in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Additional documents from Snowden, previously unpublished and dated before the Kurbanov case, provide further examples of how NSA intelligence repeatedly played an undisclosed role in bringing accused terrorists to trial in U.S. courts over the past decade and a half. They also reveal an instance in which the NSA incorrectly identified a U.S. citizen as a foreign target of a FISA warrant.</p>
<p>Civil liberties advocates have long suspected that the Justice Department is underreporting Section 702 cases in order to limit court challenges to the controversial law. Some theorize that the government conceals Section 702 use through a process known as âparallel construction,â in which evidence obtained from the warrantless surveillance authority is reobtained through traditional FISA authorization, and the government only discloses the latter authority in U.S. District Court. One defense lawyer referred to this practice in a court filing as âlaunderingâ Section 702 evidence. Beyond the Kurbanov case, circumstantial evidence in otherÂ  prosecutions suggests that this type of parallel construction could be widespread.</p>
<blockquote class='stylized pull-left' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'>âThe government intercepts Americansâ emails and phone calls in vast quantities. &#8230; Yet only a handful of individuals have ever received notice.â</blockquote>
<p>âThe government intercepts Americansâ emails and phone calls in vast quantities using this spying law and stores them in databases for years,â said Patrick Toomey, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Unionâs National Security Project. âFBI agents around the country then go searching through that trove of data as a matter of course, including in domestic criminal investigations. Yet, over almost a decade, only a handful of individuals have ever received notice.â</p>
<p>The Justice Department, FBI, and NSA declined to comment for this article. The New York Times in 2013 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/politics/us-legal-shift-may-open-door-for-challenge-to-secret-wiretaps.html">reported</a> that lawyers in the Justice Departmentâs National Security Division had believed they did not need to disclose in court whether evidence obtained through FISA specifically originated with Section 702 unless they were presenting material received directly from a Section 702 sweep. The U.S. solicitor general then successfully pushed for a change in policy, bolstered by fallout from the Snowden disclosures; this was followed by a review of past cases by the National Security Division, after which prosecutors filed supplemental Section 702 notices in a handful of cases around the country. In four such cases, the defendants had already been convicted by the time of the disclosure. And whatever changes occurred in 2013 were clearly limited, given that fewer than a dozen such notices have ever been given in court cases, and none at all has been filed in the last year and a half. Kurbanov, meanwhile, was convicted in 2015, well after the purported change in policy.</p>
<p>The governmentâs handling of its Section 702 authority is particularly important at the moment because the powers are scheduled to expire at the end of the year unless Congress reauthorizes them. Three reauthorization bills are winding through Congress. The Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Judiciary Committee have each produced one, while a third has been sponsored by U.S. senators and longtime intelligence community critics Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky. As currently written, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4114759-Wyden-Paul-USA-Rights-Act.html">the Wyden-Paul bill</a> would strengthen notification requirements and curb the Justice Departmentâs ability to launder Section 702 evidence through traditional FISA. The bill would require notification of Section 702 surveillance even when evidence derived from that surveillance âwas subsequently reobtained through other means.â Meanwhile, the bill that emerged from the Senate Intelligence Committee appears to <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/10/23/the-senate-intelligence-committee-702-bill-is-a-domestic-spying-bill/">expand</a> Section 702 without providing additional safeguards.</p>
<p>The undisclosed use of warrantless surveillance to win prosecutions is also troubling from a constitutional standpoint, foreclosing a rare opportunity to discover Section 702 abuses and challenge the law, which civil liberties advocates have argued <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/What_Went_%20Wrong_With_The_FISA_Court.pdf">is unconstitutional</a>. Although FISA stipulates that targets of surveillance may challenge the order that led to spying against them, and although Section 702 is clearly used on a massive scale, courts have been strict in deciding who is a âtargetâ of the surveillance authority, and of similar mass spying programs, and thus has standing to challenge the monitoring. For example, the Supreme Court in 2013 ruled, in a 5-4 decision, that Amnesty International and other plaintiffs could not bring a Section 702-related lawsuit because their claim that they would be targeted or harmed by such eavesdropping was too speculative. During arguments prior to the ruling, the U.S. solicitor general specifically told the justices that more suitable plaintiffs would likely emerge because people charged due to Section 702 surveillance would be notified by prosecutors and could then challenge the use of the surveillance in court.</p>
<p>âThe failure to provide notice not only prevents defendants from challenging surveillance programs in court, but also stymies the publicâs interest in understanding how and when its vast authorities are used,â said Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Centerâs Liberty and National Security Program. âWe know that the FBI has a practice of trawling through the vast databases of information captured under Section 702 for information about Americans, but it has only acknowledged relying on such surveillance in a handful of cases and then only when its failure to provide the legally required notice generated public pressure to do so.â</p>

<span data-shortcode-type='dropcap' class='dropcap'>C</span><u>lassified documents provided</u> by Snowden expose the questionable use of NSA surveillance to spy on a U.S. citizen and the covert role NSA played in several investigations that resulted in criminal convictions. More broadly, the documents offer a view into how the relationship between the NSA and the FBI has evolved over more than a decade into a de facto partnership for investigating alleged terrorists who ultimately wind up in U.S. courts.</p>
<p>In the immediate years after the 9/11 attacks, as the FBI and NSA refocused on counterterrorism as their top priority, the NSA was acutely reliant on the FBI for its relationships with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secret judicial body that provides oversight of surveillance authorization requests, and with U.S. internet and telecommunications companies. In large measure, in these early years the NSA needed the FBI to function effectively as a signals intelligence agency for counterterrorism purposes. For example, when the NSA required authority to target for surveillance a specific phone number or email address â even when the NSA did not know the identity of the person behind that phone number or email address â <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/30/nsa-classification-guide-for-fisa/">the FBI went before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain authorization on the NSAâs behalf</a>. In turn, once that authorization was granted, the NSA needed the FBI to contact the internet or telecommunications company to obtain the data.</p>
<blockquote class='stylized pull-left' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'>The NSA defined a U.S. citizenâs email address as not being related to a U.S. person when the NSA and FBI should have known this was incorrect â Tarik ShahÂ  had played at Bill Clintonâs inauguration.</blockquote>
<p>An <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/sidtoday-fisa-teaming-with-the-fbi-in-the-global-war-on-terrorism">August 17, 2005, edition of SIDtoday</a>, the internal newsletter of the NSAâs Signals Intelligence Directorate, disclosed that at the time 40 percent of all NSA counterterrorism reporting was derived from FISA collection. The newsletter added: âNSA gets most of its (counterterrorism)-related FISA collection from the FBI. The FBI collects, formats, and disseminates international terrorism-related FISA intercept to NSA, CIA, and internally to FBI agents and analysts.â In 2004, the NSA began to embed employees in the FBIâs Data Intercept Technology Unit, in Quantico, Virginia, so that NSA employees could speak more directly with U.S. data providers, such as internet companies, about formatting data to NSA specifications. âThis is the first time that the NSA FISA team has had direct access to the providers, which has proven to be extremely useful to NSA,â the newsletter stated.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/pinwale-transnational-dni-training">internal NSA documents</a>, FISA data obtained by the FBI is funneled into a special partition in PINWALE , the NSAâs massive database of digital communications that can be queried by email address, internet protocol address, and other parameters. From 2002 through 2008, according to internal files, the NSA kept a spreadsheet titled âFISA recapâ of 7,485 FISA surveillance targets consisting of email addresses or phone numbers, with columns indicating the start and end dates of the authorized surveillance and whether the target was associated with a U.S. person, defined by law as a citizen or lawful resident.</p>
<p>A decade later, most of these email addresses and phone numbers canât be traced to anyone; many belonged at the time to foreigners the government suspected were involved with terrorist organizations. Others were used by <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/07/09/under-surveillance/">civil rights activists, lawyers, and academics</a> in the United States who were never charged with federal crimes, such as Nihad Awad of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and Rutgers University professor Hooshang Amirahmadi. To have obtained FISA surveillance authority for those U.S. persons, the government had to have demonstrated to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that they were acting as agents of a foreign power. Itâs unknown how the government demonstrates this, since individual FISA applications are secret, even when evidence derived from FISA surveillance is introduced against criminal defendants.</p>
<p>In the case of at least one FISA target, the NSA defined a U.S. citizenâs email address as not being related to a U.S. person when the NSA and FBI should have known this was incorrect, suggesting the government did not have to prove the target was a foreign agent. <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/35aea606-45d0-4633-b39f-d39f769b074f">Tarik Shah</a>, a jazz bassist who had played at Bill Clintonâs inauguration, was arrested in 2005 following an informant-led FBI sting, in which Shah pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda before an undercover agent. Shahâs FISA-authorized surveillance from October 2004 through June 2005 occurred concurrently with the FBIâs sting. Shah had a friend, <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/bb9d491f-3190-43df-8ab3-2c320baefb3e">Mahmud Faruq Brent</a>, who had attended a Lashkar-e-Taiba training camp in Pakistan and complained about how âdifficult it was to be back in the United States.â But the primary link between Shah and overseas terrorists was the undercover FBI agent who pretended to be from Al Qaeda. And there was no reasonable reason for ambiguity about whether the email address belonged to Tarik Shah, the U.S. citizen, as opposed to another Tarik Shah somewhere else in the world. The email address was thebassman_12963@hotmail.com, the username a reference to Shahâs music profession. In a September 2006 filing, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asserted national security privilege to prevent disclosure of Shahâs FISA application. Shah pleaded guilty to a material support charge; he is scheduled to be released from prison next year. Itâs impossible to know from available NSA records whether the classification of Shahâs email address as a non-U.S. person was an anomaly or part of a broader NSA practice of targeting U.S. persons without having to provide probable cause to the FISA court that they were agents of foreign powers â a requirement intended protect U.S. citizens and legal residents from unreasonable search and seizure.</p>
<p>Because the FBI stood between the NSA and FISA data collection, NSA analysts encountered bottlenecks that frustrated counterterrorism and intelligence operations, internal NSA communication show. In April 2006, for example, the NSA was monitoring <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/1464e927-8696-449e-9da3-12a2ee6f098d">Ehsanul Islam Sadequee</a> through a FISA authorization the FBI had obtained. A Bangladeshi-American who was born in the United States and grew up in the Atlanta suburbs, Sadequee came to the attention of U.S. authorities after he and a friend, <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/120b7857-b75a-4657-accc-fbbeefb81db9">Syed Haris Ahmed</a>, traveled to Toronto to meet with several young men who were being investigated for terrorism in Canada. After that meeting in Toronto, Sadequee traveled to Bangladesh. He told U.S. counterterrorism agents prior to leaving that he was going to Bangladesh to be married. On April 5, 2006, as the FBI was closing in to arrest Sadequee, <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/re-ehsanul-sadequee-fisa-request">an NSA analyst urgently emailed the agency&#8217;s FBI liaison</a> asking for the bureau&#8217;s help documentingÂ theirÂ FISA authorization on Sadequeeâs email address. âThe reason we are pursing (sic) this is because we would like to retrieve a file that was passed between him and an associate about three weeks ago,â the NSA employee wrote. Sadequee was found guilty at trial of terrorism-related offenses, including material support for terrorists, and sentenced to 17 years in prison. His friend, Ahmed, was also found guilty at trial and received 13 years in prison; he was released in August.</p>

<span data-shortcode-type='dropcap' class='dropcap'>A</span><u>s the NSA was</u> experiencing some gridlock in its FBI-enabled FISA collection, the agency was developing new programs that sidestepped the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court â programs that would later be exposed as warrantless wiretapping and would evolve into the programs codified into law by FISA&#8217;s Section 702. Internal NSA documents written before the warrantless wiretapping program wasÂ exposed to the public reveal that the information flow slowly began to transform from the FBI to the NSA to a more bidirectional stream between both agencies. And in those early days of mass surveillance, NSA information secretly helped investigate accused terrorists who would be prosecuted in U.S. courts, Snowden documents show, although itâs not clear if the intelligence originated with warrantless eavesdropping or other sources.</p>
<p>In 2003, following a sting operation involving two informants and a meeting in Germany, Yemeni cleric <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/edb63180-668c-48ae-a448-7a4618341198">Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad</a> was arrested in Frankfurt and extradited to the United States, where he was charged with raising money for Hamas and Al Qaeda. Moayad was convicted at trial in 2005. <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/sidtoday-life-as-the-sid-liaison-to-the-joint-terrorism-task-force-in-nyc">In an August 3, 2005, edition of SIDtoday</a>, an NSA employee gave the agency credit for Moayadâs conviction. âAlthough this fact is unknown to the general public, and to the vast majority of the law enforcement community, NSA reporting played a key role in bringing the sheikh to trial,â the NSA employee wrote. Itâs not clear what role NSA played in Moayadâs investigation. Moayad, who was not a U.S. person during the investigation, was not notified of FISA surveillance, court records show; nonetheless, his verdict was overturned after an appeals court ruled that testimony about unrelated terrorist activity had been allowed to prejudice the jury. Moayad was deported to Yemen in 2009 as part of a deal in which he pleaded guilty to conspiring to raise money for Hamas.</p>

According to SIDtoday, Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi organized the failed assassination plot after a perceived insult and threat by the Saudi crown prince during an Arab League summit. In 2004, <span class="">Amoudi</span> pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges and was sentenced to 23 years in prison. âNSAâs contributions were significant,â the agencyâs newsletter reported.</p>

<p>The NSA also played a previously undisclosed role in the capture of <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/36097ddf-5ed3-4cc8-b1e0-55919b5ccd36">Nancy Conde Rubio</a>, who at the time of her arrest was the fourth-ranking member of Marxist guerrilla group FARC in Colombia. Rubio had joined the FARC when she was 16 years old, and U.S. intelligence indicated that she was the girlfriend of a FARC commander suspected of holding hostage three U.S. citizens. Through digital communications intercepts, the NSA discovered that Rubio was to travel from Venezuela to Colombia without valid paperwork, <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/30/sidtoday-perseverance-pays-off-eight-year-sigint-effort-culminates-in-arrest-of-elusive-colombian-terrorist">according to a 2008 SIDtoday article</a>. U.S. government officials provided that information to Colombian law enforcement, whose agents arrested Rubio and extradited her to Washington, D.C., for federal prosecution. She pleaded guilty to material support charges and was sentenced to 11 years and six months in prison.</p>
<p>Following the exposure of the NSAâs warrantless wiretapping programs, and the legalization of mass surveillance programs through the FISA Amendments Acts of 2008, which added Section 702 and other new provisions, the NSA continued to play a large, and largely secret, role in terrorism prosecutions in the United States.</p>
<p>One of the most notable examples involves <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/508412de-d0d0-48cd-975b-22e1fa036cdf">Najibullah Zazi</a>, who was arrested before he could move forward in an Al Qaeda-backed plot to bomb the New York subway. Zazi, a legal permanent resident of the United States, pleaded guilty to terrorism-related offenses in February 2010. The next month, on March 11, 2010, <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/sidtoday-2009-a-watershed-year-in-the-fight-against-terrorism">SIDtoday celebrated</a> âa watershed period in the fight against terrorism and radical extremist groups,â noting that the NSA first discovered Zaziâs email connections to Al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan.</p>
<p>âWithout that SIGINT lead on Zazi, his activities might not have come to the attention of the US intelligence and law enforcement communities until he actually conducted a terrorist attack against the US homeland,â an NSA employee wrote, referring to signals intelligence.</p>
<p>In July 2015, five years after Zazi pleaded guilty, prosecutors in New York notified him that he had been subjected to Section 702 surveillance. Zazi has not yet been sentenced; he is now a cooperating witness, part of a larger effort to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/04/20/terrorism-defendants-with-concrete-ties-to-violent-extremists-leverage-their-connections-to-avoid-prison/">flip well-connected terrorists into government informants</a>.

<p>According to a review of nationwide court records by The Intercept, the most recent Section 702 notification was delivered in April 2016, when prosecutors in Chicago informed <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/1a24cd5c-f43f-4850-8b7c-b6b509e0a433">Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab</a>, a Palestinian refugee who emigrated from Iraq.

<p>To those who follow these notifications, the absence of any new Section 702 filings for more than 18 months â a period during which more than 50 terrorism defendants have been charged in U.S. courts and counterterrorism officials have trumpeted the critical need for Section 702 â is suspicious.</p>
<p>âSomething is funky on one side of the ledger,â said Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel at the ACLU in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>If the FBI uses parallel construction to conceal intelligence community information, it would not be the only federal law enforcement agency doing so. In 2013, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dea-sod/exclusive-u-s-directs-agents-to-cover-up-program-used-to-investigate-americans-idUSBRE97409R20130805">Reuters</a> obtained documents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration that showed how agents were trained to ârecreateâ investigative trails to conceal how intelligence intercepts helped to identify criminal targets. Separately, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1011382-responsive-documents.html#document/p2">MuckRock obtained DEA documents</a> that suggested FISA could be used by law enforcement agencies âfor prosecutorial purposes in a manner that protects [intelligence community] sources and methods.â</p>
<p>Adding to the suspicion that FBI counterterrorism agents use parallel construction to conceal NSA cooperationÂ is a growing number of filings in terrorism cases in which defense lawyers say circumstantial evidence suggestss some form of mass surveillance program was used against their clients.</p>
<p>In South Florida, the FBI nabbed two brothers, <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/67c99def-014d-4a49-8f2b-e7b43a75dcfa">Sheheryar Alam Qazi</a> and <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/c793b443-5bcd-453f-8bd6-edd5f49cde5d">Raees Alam Qazi</a>, in an informant-led sting, in which the brothers discussed and planned for a bomb plot in New York. Federal prosecutors notified the Qazis that evidence against them included surveillance authorized under traditional FISA authority. But Sheheryar Alam Qaziâs lawyer questioned whether that evidence might have been first obtained from Section 702 and then re-obtained through traditional FISA. âThat argument was what was suspected but no hard evidence to support,â said Daniel L. Ecarius, an assistant federal public defender in Miami. The judge ruled that the governmentâs FISA notification was legally sufficient.</p>
<div class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1000px;'><a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-144104" src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/08/Final-click-trial-and-terror-1504037137.gif" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Across the country, in California, <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/70fa1d0a-f612-4046-8cc9-8d5b570f7e1b">Adam Shafi</a> was accused of providing material support to terrorist groups after the FBI discovered that Shafi had disappeared from his family for two days while they were in Egypt. Shafi later told his family and the FBI that he had traveled to Turkey to see the conditions of Syrian refugee camps, but in an affidavit to support a criminal charge, the FBI disclosed that intercepted communications revealed that Shafi had discussed traveling to Syria to join Nusra Front. Prosecutors in June told Shafiâs lawyer, Galia Amram, that they did not intend to file Section 702 notice in the case. Amram demanded that the judge determine whether Section 702 notice was required, as Qazi&#8217;s lawyer had. The judge in California also ruled that the governmentâs notification was legally sufficient.</p>
<p>The case of <a href="https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/5727a7f3-b71f-4cab-9a65-b14321555446">Khalid Ouazzani</a> is even more perplexing. In May 2016 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Matthew G. Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, specifically touted Ouazzaniâs arrest as a success story for Section 702 surveillance.</p>
<p>âNSA conducted surveillance under Section 702 of an email address used by a suspected extremist in Yemen,â Olsen said. âThis surveillance led NSA to discover a connection between the extremist and an unknown person in Kansas City, Missouri, who was then identified as Khalid Ouazzani. The follow-up investigation revealed that Ouazzani was connected to other Al Qaeda associates in the United States, who were part of an earlier plot to bomb the New York Stock Exchange.â</p>
<p>Ouazzani, a used car and auto parts dealer, pleaded guilty in 2010 to sending $23,500 to Al Qaeda. But court records in his case show that he was not notified of either traditional FISA or Section 702 surveillance.</p>
<p>Explaining why Ouazzani would not be notified of Section 702 surveillance while 10 other terrorism defendants were notified of such surveillance is impossible because the Justice Department has refused to release documents related to its notification policy. The ACLU sued the Justice Department in 2013 under the Freedom of Information Act to release documents related to the policy. The Justice Department still refused to comply, claiming none of its documents contained a âbindingâ interpretation of the obligation to provide Section 702 notice.</p>
<p>âWithout knowing the governmentâs policy, itâs impossible to even begin to audit whether these notifications are taking place in all cases where they are legally required,â said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
<p>The notification concerns surrounding Section 702 do not affect only accused terrorists. While to date only terrorism defendants have received notification of Section 702 evidence, the FBI does not have a policy limiting the use of Section 702 searches to suspected terrorists. The searches are available for all domestic criminal investigations.</p>
<p>âThe immense authorities given to security agencies for counterterrorism purposes should be of concern to every American,â said Patel of the Brennan Center. âThe government is able to circumvent the Fourth Amendmentâs warrant requirement to go poking around into private communications. This allows for targeting for reasons of politics and prejudice.â</p>

A Christian who had converted from Islam, Kurbanov arrived as a refugee and spoke little English. Resettled in Boise, Idaho, he rented an apartment, worked odd jobs, and was studying to be a truck driver.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But about three years after entering the U.S., around the time he converted back to Islam, Kurbanov was placed under FBI surveillance. According to emails and internet chat logs obtained by the government, Kurbanov was disgusted by having seen Americans burn the Quran and by reports that an American soldier had tried to rape a Muslim girl. âMy entire life, everything, changed,â Kurbanov wrote in a July 31, 2012 email.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After the FBI assigned one informant to live with him and another informant to attend his truck-driving school, Kurbanov was arrested in May 2013. Prosecutors accused him of providing material support to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and possessing bomb-making materials.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>During Kurbanov&#8217;s trial, the government notified him that his conversations with an alleged Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan associate based in Pakistan had been intercepted. The spying, federal prosecutors said, had been authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which regulates the monitoring of agents of foreign governments and terrorist organizations. Kurbanov was convicted at trial and sentenced to 25 years in prison, after which heâll be deported to Uzbekistan. He is an apparent success story for U.S. counterterrorism officials. If there was any doubt about Kurbanov&#8217;s propensity for violence, he eliminated it by stabbing a prison warden in California, an act for which he is now facing additional charges.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But Justice Department lawyers gained their conviction against Kurbanov after failing to disclose a legally significant fact: Kurbanovâs conversations with his alleged terrorist associate had been captured through \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">PRISM\u003c/a>, a National Security Agency mass surveillance program whose existence was revealed in documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Under PRISM, the government obtains communications directly from at least eight large technology companies without the need for warrants, a type of practice authorized in 2008, when Congress provided new surveillance powers under FISA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>The government must disclose when information against defendants originates from warrantless surveillance â but prosecutors did not do so to Kurbanov.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>While traditional FISA authority permits spying on a particular person or group through warrants issued by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, under the new powers, codified in FISA Section 702, monitoring is approved inÂ bulk by the court through what is essentially a recipe for mass surveillance. Once approved, such a recipe can be used against thousands of targets. Under Section 702 authority, the NSA is currently monitoring digital communications of more than 100,000 people; it swept up an estimated 250 million internet communications each year as of a \u003ca href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/NS-DC-0057-0002.pdf\">2011 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinion\u003c/a>. The FBI frequently searches Section 702 databases when it opens national security and domestic criminal &#8220;assessments,&#8221; precursors to full investigations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/sso-weekly-brief-25-april-2013-excerpt\">a slide in an NSA presentation\u003c/a>, provided by Snowden and published for the first time today by The Intercept, the interception of Kurbanovâs conversations was a âReporting Highlightâ for PRISM. The document indicates that the NSA captured Kurbanovâs Skype conversations from October 2012 through April 2013, roughly the same period the FBI was investigating him with undercover informants. It further details how an NSA unit in April 2013 issued a report describing âhow Kurbanov believed he was under surveillance (which he is by the FBI) but was cautiously continuing his work, which was not specified â could be raising money for the IMU or explosive testing.â The alleged terrorist associate with whom Kurbanov was communicating âwanted Kurbanov to set this work in motion, probably related to sending money back to the IMU,â the document added.\u003c/p>\n\n                \u003cdiv id='dcv-4310977-SSO-Weekly-Brief-25-April-2013-Excerpt' class='document-cloud-container' data-linking='theintercept' data-permalink='https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/30/sso-weekly-brief-25-april-2013-excerpt/'>\u003c/div>\n                \u003cscript>\n                    DV.load('//www.documentcloud.org/documents/4310977-SSO-Weekly-Brief-25-April-2013-Excerpt.js', {\n                        width: '100%',\n                        height: '450',\n                        sidebar: false,\n                        container: '#dcv-4310977-SSO-Weekly-Brief-25-April-2013-Excerpt'\n                    });\n                \u003c/script>\n            \n\u003cp>The government is obligated to disclose to criminal defendants when information against them originates from Section 702 reporting, but federal prosecutors did not do so in Kurbanovâs case. In fact, when Kurbanovâs lawyers demanded disclosure of FISA-related evidence and the suppression of that evidence, Attorney General Eric Holder asserted national security privilege, claiming in a declaration that disclosure of FISA information would âharm the national security of the United States.â Kurbanovâs lawyer, Chuck Peterson, declined to comment about the governmentâs use of Section 702 surveillance against his client.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Kurbanov does not appear to be the only defendant kept in the dark about how warrantless surveillance was used against him. A nationwide review of federal court records by The Intercept found that of 75 terrorism defendants notified of some type of FISA spying since Section 702 became law, just 10 received notice of Section 702 surveillance. And yet Section 702 was credited with âwell over 100 arrests on terrorism-related offensesâ in a July 2014 \u003ca href=\"https://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf\">report\u003c/a> from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the federal entity created to oversee intelligence authorities granted in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Additional documents from Snowden, previously unpublished and dated before the Kurbanov case, provide further examples of how NSA intelligence repeatedly played an undisclosed role in bringing accused terrorists to trial in U.S. courts over the past decade and a half. They also reveal an instance in which the NSA incorrectly identified a U.S. citizen as a foreign target of a FISA warrant.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Civil liberties advocates have long suspected that the Justice Department is underreporting Section 702 cases in order to limit court challenges to the controversial law. Some theorize that the government conceals Section 702 use through a process known as âparallel construction,â in which evidence obtained from the warrantless surveillance authority is reobtained through traditional FISA authorization, and the government only discloses the latter authority in U.S. District Court. One defense lawyer referred to this practice in a court filing as âlaunderingâ Section 702 evidence. Beyond the Kurbanov case, circumstantial evidence in otherÂ  prosecutions suggests that this type of parallel construction could be widespread.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'>âThe government intercepts Americansâ emails and phone calls in vast quantities. &#8230; Yet only a handful of individuals have ever received notice.â\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>âThe government intercepts Americansâ emails and phone calls in vast quantities using this spying law and stores them in databases for years,â said Patrick Toomey, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Unionâs National Security Project. âFBI agents around the country then go searching through that trove of data as a matter of course, including in domestic criminal investigations. Yet, over almost a decade, only a handful of individuals have ever received notice.â\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Justice Department, FBI, and NSA declined to comment for this article. The New York Times in 2013 \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/politics/us-legal-shift-may-open-door-for-challenge-to-secret-wiretaps.html\">reported\u003c/a> that lawyers in the Justice Departmentâs National Security Division had believed they did not need to disclose in court whether evidence obtained through FISA specifically originated with Section 702 unless they were presenting material received directly from a Section 702 sweep. The U.S. solicitor general then successfully pushed for a change in policy, bolstered by fallout from the Snowden disclosures; this was followed by a review of past cases by the National Security Division, after which prosecutors filed supplemental Section 702 notices in a handful of cases around the country. In four such cases, the defendants had already been convicted by the time of the disclosure. And whatever changes occurred in 2013 were clearly limited, given that fewer than a dozen such notices have ever been given in court cases, and none at all has been filed in the last year and a half. Kurbanov, meanwhile, was convicted in 2015, well after the purported change in policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The governmentâs handling of its Section 702 authority is particularly important at the moment because the powers are scheduled to expire at the end of the year unless Congress reauthorizes them. Three reauthorization bills are winding through Congress. The Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Judiciary Committee have each produced one, while a third has been sponsored by U.S. senators and longtime intelligence community critics Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky. As currently written, \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4114759-Wyden-Paul-USA-Rights-Act.html\">the Wyden-Paul bill\u003c/a> would strengthen notification requirements and curb the Justice Departmentâs ability to launder Section 702 evidence through traditional FISA. The bill would require notification of Section 702 surveillance even when evidence derived from that surveillance âwas subsequently reobtained through other means.â Meanwhile, the bill that emerged from the Senate Intelligence Committee appears to \u003ca href=\"https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/10/23/the-senate-intelligence-committee-702-bill-is-a-domestic-spying-bill/\">expand\u003c/a> Section 702 without providing additional safeguards.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The undisclosed use of warrantless surveillance to win prosecutions is also troubling from a constitutional standpoint, foreclosing a rare opportunity to discover Section 702 abuses and challenge the law, which civil liberties advocates have argued \u003ca href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/What_Went_%20Wrong_With_The_FISA_Court.pdf\">is unconstitutional\u003c/a>. Although FISA stipulates that targets of surveillance may challenge the order that led to spying against them, and although Section 702 is clearly used on a massive scale, courts have been strict in deciding who is a âtargetâ of the surveillance authority, and of similar mass spying programs, and thus has standing to challenge the monitoring. For example, the Supreme Court in 2013 ruled, in a 5-4 decision, that Amnesty International and other plaintiffs could not bring a Section 702-related lawsuit because their claim that they would be targeted or harmed by such eavesdropping was too speculative. During arguments prior to the ruling, the U.S. solicitor general specifically told the justices that more suitable plaintiffs would likely emerge because people charged due to Section 702 surveillance would be notified by prosecutors and could then challenge the use of the surveillance in court.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>âThe failure to provide notice not only prevents defendants from challenging surveillance programs in court, but also stymies the publicâs interest in understanding how and when its vast authorities are used,â said Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Centerâs Liberty and National Security Program. âWe know that the FBI has a practice of trawling through the vast databases of information captured under Section 702 for information about Americans, but it has only acknowledged relying on such surveillance in a handful of cases and then only when its failure to provide the legally required notice generated public pressure to do so.â\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 852px;'>\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/FISA16-1511987843.jpg\">\u003cimg src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/FISA16-1511987843.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a>\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Graphic: The Intercept\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cbr />\n\u003cspan data-shortcode-type='dropcap' class='dropcap'>C\u003c/span>\u003cu>lassified documents provided\u003c/u> by Snowden expose the questionable use of NSA surveillance to spy on a U.S. citizen and the covert role NSA played in several investigations that resulted in criminal convictions. More broadly, the documents offer a view into how the relationship between the NSA and the FBI has evolved over more than a decade into a de facto partnership for investigating alleged terrorists who ultimately wind up in U.S. courts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the immediate years after the 9/11 attacks, as the FBI and NSA refocused on counterterrorism as their top priority, the NSA was acutely reliant on the FBI for its relationships with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secret judicial body that provides oversight of surveillance authorization requests, and with U.S. internet and telecommunications companies. In large measure, in these early years the NSA needed the FBI to function effectively as a signals intelligence agency for counterterrorism purposes. For example, when the NSA required authority to target for surveillance a specific phone number or email address â even when the NSA did not know the identity of the person behind that phone number or email address â \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/30/nsa-classification-guide-for-fisa/\">the FBI went before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain authorization on the NSAâs behalf\u003c/a>. In turn, once that authorization was granted, the NSA needed the FBI to contact the internet or telecommunications company to obtain the data.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'>The NSA defined a U.S. citizenâs email address as not being related to a U.S. person when the NSA and FBI should have known this was incorrect â Tarik ShahÂ  had played at Bill Clintonâs inauguration.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>An \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/sidtoday-fisa-teaming-with-the-fbi-in-the-global-war-on-terrorism\">August 17, 2005, edition of SIDtoday\u003c/a>, the internal newsletter of the NSAâs Signals Intelligence Directorate, disclosed that at the time 40 percent of all NSA counterterrorism reporting was derived from FISA collection. The newsletter added: âNSA gets most of its (counterterrorism)-related FISA collection from the FBI. The FBI collects, formats, and disseminates international terrorism-related FISA intercept to NSA, CIA, and internally to FBI agents and analysts.â In 2004, the NSA began to embed employees in the FBIâs Data Intercept Technology Unit, in Quantico, Virginia, so that NSA employees could speak more directly with U.S. data providers, such as internet companies, about formatting data to NSA specifications. âThis is the first time that the NSA FISA team has had direct access to the providers, which has proven to be extremely useful to NSA,â the newsletter stated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/pinwale-transnational-dni-training\">internal NSA documents\u003c/a>, FISA data obtained by the FBI is funneled into a special partition in PINWALE , the NSAâs massive database of digital communications that can be queried by email address, internet protocol address, and other parameters. From 2002 through 2008, according to internal files, the NSA kept a spreadsheet titled âFISA recapâ of 7,485 FISA surveillance targets consisting of email addresses or phone numbers, with columns indicating the start and end dates of the authorized surveillance and whether the target was associated with a U.S. person, defined by law as a citizen or lawful resident.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A decade later, most of these email addresses and phone numbers canât be traced to anyone; many belonged at the time to foreigners the government suspected were involved with terrorist organizations. Others were used by \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/07/09/under-surveillance/\">civil rights activists, lawyers, and academics\u003c/a> in the United States who were never charged with federal crimes, such as Nihad Awad of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and Rutgers University professor Hooshang Amirahmadi. To have obtained FISA surveillance authority for those U.S. persons, the government had to have demonstrated to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that they were acting as agents of a foreign power. Itâs unknown how the government demonstrates this, since individual FISA applications are secret, even when evidence derived from FISA surveillance is introduced against criminal defendants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the case of at least one FISA target, the NSA defined a U.S. citizenâs email address as not being related to a U.S. person when the NSA and FBI should have known this was incorrect, suggesting the government did not have to prove the target was a foreign agent. \u003ca href=\"https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/35aea606-45d0-4633-b39f-d39f769b074f\">Tarik Shah\u003c/a>, a jazz bassist who had played at Bill Clintonâs inauguration, was arrested in 2005 following an informant-led FBI sting, in which Shah pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda before an undercover agent. Shahâs FISA-authorized surveillance from October 2004 through June 2005 occurred concurrently with the FBIâs sting. Shah had a friend, \u003ca href=\"https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/bb9d491f-3190-43df-8ab3-2c320baefb3e\">Mahmud Faruq Brent\u003c/a>, who had attended a Lashkar-e-Taiba training camp in Pakistan and complained about how âdifficult it was to be back in the United States.â But the primary link between Shah and overseas terrorists was the undercover FBI agent who pretended to be from Al Qaeda. And there was no reasonable reason for ambiguity about whether the email address belonged to Tarik Shah, the U.S. citizen, as opposed to another Tarik Shah somewhere else in the world. The email address was thebassman_12963@hotmail.com, the username a reference to Shahâs music profession. In a September 2006 filing, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asserted national security privilege to prevent disclosure of Shahâs FISA application. Shah pleaded guilty to a material support charge; he is scheduled to be released from prison next year. Itâs impossible to know from available NSA records whether the classification of Shahâs email address as a non-U.S. person was an anomaly or part of a broader NSA practice of targeting U.S. persons without having to provide probable cause to the FISA court that they were agents of foreign powers â a requirement intended protect U.S. citizens and legal residents from unreasonable search and seizure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Because the FBI stood between the NSA and FISA data collection, NSA analysts encountered bottlenecks that frustrated counterterrorism and intelligence operations, internal NSA communication show. In April 2006, for example, the NSA was monitoring \u003ca href=\"https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/1464e927-8696-449e-9da3-12a2ee6f098d\">Ehsanul Islam Sadequee\u003c/a> through a FISA authorization the FBI had obtained. A Bangladeshi-American who was born in the United States and grew up in the Atlanta suburbs, Sadequee came to the attention of U.S. authorities after he and a friend, \u003ca href=\"https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/120b7857-b75a-4657-accc-fbbeefb81db9\">Syed Haris Ahmed\u003c/a>, traveled to Toronto to meet with several young men who were being investigated for terrorism in Canada. After that meeting in Toronto, Sadequee traveled to Bangladesh. He told U.S. counterterrorism agents prior to leaving that he was going to Bangladesh to be married. On April 5, 2006, as the FBI was closing in to arrest Sadequee, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/re-ehsanul-sadequee-fisa-request\">an NSA analyst urgently emailed the agency&#8217;s FBI liaison\u003c/a> asking for the bureau&#8217;s help documentingÂ theirÂ FISA authorization on Sadequeeâs email address. âThe reason we are pursing (sic) this is because we would like to retrieve a file that was passed between him and an associate about three weeks ago,â the NSA employee wrote. Sadequee was found guilty at trial of terrorism-related offenses, including material support for terrorists, and sentenced to 17 years in prison. His friend, Ahmed, was also found guilty at trial and received 13 years in prison; he was released in August.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'>\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Mohammed-Ali-Al-Moayad--1511371265.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-159244\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Mohammed-Ali-Al-Moayad--1511371265-1024x691.jpg\" alt=\"Yemeni Religious Endowments and Guidance Minister Hamud al-Hattar walks past pictures of Yemeni cleric Sheikh Mohammed Ali al-Moayad (L) and his assistant and bodyguard Mohammed Zayed (R) as he arrives to greet them at the airport in Sanaa on August 11, 2009 following their deportation from the US.

Internal NSA documents written before the warrantless wiretapping program wasÂ exposed to the public reveal that the information flow slowly began to transform from the FBI to the NSA to a more bidirectional stream between both agencies.

Itâs not clear what role NSA played in Moayadâs investigation. Moayad, who was not a U.S. person during the investigation, was not notified of FISA surveillance, court records show; nonetheless, his verdict was overturned after an appeals court ruled that testimony about unrelated terrorist activity had been allowed to prejudice the jury. Moayad was deported to Yemen in 2009 as part of a deal in which he pleaded guilty to conspiring to raise money for Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n                \u003cdiv id='dcv-4310981-2005-08-03-SIDToday-Life-as-the-SID-Liaison-to' class='document-cloud-container' data-linking='theintercept' data-permalink='https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/30/sidtoday-life-as-the-sid-liaison-to-the-joint-terrorism-task-force-in-nyc/'>\u003c/div>\n                \u003cscript>\n                    DV.load('//www.documentcloud.org/documents/4310981-2005-08-03-SIDToday-Life-as-the-SID-Liaison-to.js', {\n                        width: '100%',\n                        height: '450',\n                        sidebar: false,\n                        container: '#dcv-4310981-2005-08-03-SIDToday-Life-as-the-SID-Liaison-to'\n                    });\n                \u003c/script>\n            \n\u003cp>A week after crowing about its secret role in Moayadâs trial, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2017/11/28/sidtoday-the-saudi-assassination-plot-how-it-was-thwarted\">the NSA boasted internally through SIDtoday\u003c/a> that the agency played a key role in investigating \u003ca href=\"https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/people/5017bc15-e68d-4159-a7a2-263b157e7253\">Abdurahman Muhammad al-Amoudi\u003c/a>, a U.S. citizen who was involved in financial transactions with Libya and a plot to assassinate the Saudi crown prince.

Prosecutors in June told Shafiâs lawyer, Galia Amram, that they did not intend to file Section 702 notice in the case. Amram demanded that the judge determine whether Section 702 notice was required, as Qazi&#8217;s lawyer had.

The ACLU sued the Justice Department in 2013 under the Freedom of Information Act to release documents related to the policy. The Justice Department still refused to comply, claiming none of its documents contained a âbindingâ interpretation of the obligation to provide Section 702 notice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>âWithout knowing the governmentâs policy, itâs impossible to even begin to audit whether these notifications are taking place in all cases where they are legally required,â said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The notification concerns surrounding Section 702 do not affect only accused terrorists.

data-reactid="195"><div data-reactid="196"><p>Across the world, people who work as system administrators keep computer networks in order â and this has turned them into unwitting targets of the National Security Agency for simply doing their jobs. According to <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/20/hunt-sys-admins/">a secret document</a> provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the agency tracks down the private email and Facebook accounts of system administrators (or sys admins, as they are often called), before hacking their computers to gain access to the networks they control.</p>
<p>The document consists of several posts â one of them is titled &#8220;I hunt sys admins&#8221; â that were published in 2012 on an internal discussion board hosted on the agencyâs classified servers. They were written by an NSA official involved in the agency&#8217;s effort to break into foreign network routers, the devices that connect computer networks and transport data across the Internet. By infiltrating the computers of system administrators who work for foreign phone and Internet companies, the NSA can gain access to the calls and emails that flow over their networks.</p>
<p>The classified posts reveal how the NSA official aspired to create a database that would function as an international hit list of sys admins to potentially target. Yet the document makes clear that the admins are not suspected of any criminal activity â they are targeted only because they control access to networks the agency wants to infiltrate. &#8220;Who better to target than the person that already has the &#8216;keys to the kingdom&#8217;?&#8221; one of the posts says.</p>
<p>The NSA wants more than just passwords. The document includes a list of other data that can be harvested from computers belonging to sys admins, including network maps, customer lists, business correspondence and, the author jokes, &#8220;pictures of cats in funny poses with amusing captions.&#8221; The posts, boastful and casual in tone, contain hacker jargonÂ  (pwn, skillz, zomg, internetz) and are punctuated with expressions of mischief. &#8220;Current mood: devious,â reads one, while another signs off, &#8220;Current mood: scheming.&#8221;</p>
<p>The author of the posts, whose name is being withheld by <em>The Intercept</em>, is a network specialist in the agency&#8217;s Signals Intelligence Directorate, according to other NSA documents. The same author wrote secret presentations related to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption">NSA&#8217;s controversial program</a> to identify users of the Tor browser â a privacy-enhancing tool that allows people to browse the Internet anonymously. The network specialist, who served as a private contractor prior to joining the NSA, shows little respect for hackers who do not work for the government. One post expresses disdain for the quality of presentations at Blackhat and Defcon, the computer worldâs premier security and hacker conferences:</p>
<p><a href="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/03/defcon.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90" target="_blank"><div class='image-pad image-border default  image-shadow' style='border:1px solid #333;'><img src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/03/defcon.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90" alt='' title='' /></div></a></p>
<p>It is unclear how precise the NSA&#8217;s hacking attacks are or how the agency ensures that it excludes Americans from the intrusions. The author explains in one post that the NSA scours the Internet to find people it deems âprobableâ administrators, suggesting a lack of certainty in the process and implying that the wrong person could be targeted. It is illegal for the NSA to deliberately target Americans for surveillance without explicit prior authorization. But the employeeâs posts make no mention of any measures that might be taken to prevent hacking the computers of Americans who work as sys admins for foreign networks. Without such measures, Americans who work on such networks could potentially fall victim to an NSA infiltration attempt.</p>
<p>The NSA declined to answer questions about its efforts to hack system administrators or explain how it ensures Americans are not mistakenly targeted. Agency spokeswoman Vaneeâ Vines said in an email statement: &#8220;A key part of the protections that apply to both U.S. persons and citizens of other countries is the mandate that information be in support of a valid foreign intelligence requirement, and comply with U.S. Attorney General-approved procedures to protect privacy rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <em>The Intercept</em> <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/">revealed last week</a>, clandestine hacking has become central to the NSA&#8217;s mission in the past decade. The agency is working to aggressively scale its ability to break into computers to perform what it calls &#8220;computer network exploitation,&#8221; or CNE: the collection of intelligence from covertly infiltrated computer systems. Hacking into the computers of sys admins is particularly controversial because unlike conventional targets â people who are regarded as threats â sys admins are not suspected of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In a post calling sys admins &#8220;a means to an end,&#8221; the NSA employee writes, &#8220;Up front, sys admins generally are not my end target. My end target is the extremist/terrorist or government official that happens to be using the network some admin takes care of.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first step, according to the posts, is to collect IP addresses that are believed to be linked to a networkâs sys admin. An IP address is a series of numbers allocated to every computer that connects to the Internet. Using this identifier, the NSA can then run an IP address through the vast amount of signals intelligence data, or SIGINT, that it collects every day, trying to match the IP address to personal accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;d really like is a personal webmail or Facebook account to target,&#8221; one of the posts explains, presumably because, whereas IP addresses can be shared by multiple people, &#8220;alternative selectors&#8221; like a webmail or Facebook account can be linked to a particular target. You can &#8220;dumpster-dive for alternate selectors in the big SIGINT trash can&#8221; the author suggests. Or &#8220;pull out your wicked Google-fu&#8221; (slang for efficient Googling) to search for any &#8220;official and non-official e-mails&#8221; that the targets may have posted online.</p>
<p>Once the agency believes it has identified a sys adminâs personal accounts, according to the posts, it can target them with its so-called <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/">QUANTUM hacking techniques</a>. The Snowden files reveal that the QUANTUM methods <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/17/nsa-secretly-masqueraded-facebook-hack-computers-surveillance/">have been used</a> to secretly inject surveillance malware into a Facebook page by sending malicious NSA data packets that appear to originate from a genuine Facebook server. This method tricks a targetâs computer into accepting the malicious packets, allowing the NSA to infect the targeted computer with a malware &#8220;implant&#8221; and gain unfettered access to the data stored on its hard drive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just pull those selectors, queue them up for QUANTUM, and proceed with the pwnage,&#8221; the author of the posts writes. (&#8220;Pwnage,&#8221; short for &#8220;pure ownage,&#8221; is gamer-speak for defeating opponents.) The author adds, triumphantly, &#8220;Yay! /throws confetti in the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one case, these tactics were used by the NSA&#8217;s British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, to infiltrate the Belgian telecommunications company Belgacom. As <em>Der Speigel </em><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/ghcq-targets-engineers-with-fake-linkedin-pages-a-932821.html">revealed last year</a>, Belgacomâs network engineers were targeted by GCHQ in a QUANTUM mission named &#8220;Operation Socialist&#8221; â with the British agency hacking into the companyâs systems in an effort to monitor smartphones.</p>
<p>While targeting innocent sys admins may be surprising on its own, the &#8220;hunt sys admins&#8221; document reveals how the NSA network specialist secretly discussed building a &#8220;master list&#8221; of sys admins across the world, which would enable an attack to be initiated on one of them the moment their network was thought to be used by a person of interest. One post outlines how this process would make it easier for the NSAâs specialist hacking unit, Tailored Access Operations (TAO), to infiltrate networks and begin collecting, or &#8220;tasking,&#8221; data:</p>
<p><a href="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/03/go-CNE.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90" target="_blank"><div class='image-pad image-border default  image-shadow' style='border:1px solid #333;'><img src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/03/go-CNE.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90" alt='' title='' /></div></a></p>
<p>Aside from offering up thoughts on covert hacking tactics, the author of these posts also provides a glimpse into internal employee complaints at the NSA. The posts describe how the agencyâs spies gripe about having &#8220;dismal infrastructure&#8221; and a &#8220;Big Data Problem&#8221; because of the massive volume of information being collected by NSA surveillance systems. For the author, however, the vast data troves are actually something to be enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ability to pull bits out of random places of the Internet, bring them back to the mother-base to evaluate and build intelligence off of is just plain awesome!&#8221; the author writes. &#8220;One of the coolest things about it is <i>how much</i> data we have at our fingertips.&#8221;</p>

According to \u003ca href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/20/hunt-sys-admins/\">a secret document\u003c/a> provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the agency tracks down the private email and Facebook accounts of system administrators (or sys admins, as they are often called), before hacking their computers to gain access to the networks they control.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The document consists of several posts â one of them is titled &#8220;I hunt sys admins&#8221; â that were published in 2012 on an internal discussion board hosted on the agencyâs classified servers. They were written by an NSA official involved in the agency&#8217;s effort to break into foreign network routers, the devices that connect computer networks and transport data across the Internet. By infiltrating the computers of system administrators who work for foreign phone and Internet companies, the NSA can gain access to the calls and emails that flow over their networks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The classified posts reveal how the NSA official aspired to create a database that would function as an international hit list of sys admins to potentially target. Yet the document makes clear that the admins are not suspected of any criminal activity â they are targeted only because they control access to networks the agency wants to infiltrate. &#8220;Who better to target than the person that already has the &#8216;keys to the kingdom&#8217;?&#8221; one of the posts says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The NSA wants more than just passwords. The document includes a list of other data that can be harvested from computers belonging to sys admins, including network maps, customer lists, business correspondence and, the author jokes, &#8220;pictures of cats in funny poses with amusing captions.&#8221; The posts, boastful and casual in tone, contain hacker jargonÂ  (pwn, skillz, zomg, internetz) and are punctuated with expressions of mischief. &#8220;Current mood: devious,â reads one, while another signs off, &#8220;Current mood: scheming.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The author of the posts, whose name is being withheld by \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>, is a network specialist in the agency&#8217;s Signals Intelligence Directorate, according to other NSA documents. The same author wrote secret presentations related to the \u003ca href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption\">NSA&#8217;s controversial program\u003c/a> to identify users of the Tor browser â a privacy-enhancing tool that allows people to browse the Internet anonymously. The network specialist, who served as a private contractor prior to joining the NSA, shows little respect for hackers who do not work for the government. One post expresses disdain for the quality of presentations at Blackhat and Defcon, the computer worldâs premier security and hacker conferences:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/03/defcon.png\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cdiv class='image-pad image-border default  image-shadow' style='border:1px solid #333;'>\u003cimg src='https://firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/03/defcon.png' alt='' title='' />\u003c/div>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It is unclear how precise the NSA&#8217;s hacking attacks are or how the agency ensures that it excludes Americans from the intrusions. The author explains in one post that the NSA scours the Internet to find people it deems âprobableâ administrators, suggesting a lack of certainty in the process and implying that the wrong person could be targeted. It is illegal for the NSA to deliberately target Americans for surveillance without explicit prior authorization. But the employeeâs posts make no mention of any measures that might be taken to prevent hacking the computers of Americans who work as sys admins for foreign networks. Without such measures, Americans who work on such networks could potentially fall victim to an NSA infiltration attempt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The NSA declined to answer questions about its efforts to hack system administrators or explain how it ensures Americans are not mistakenly targeted. Agency spokeswoman Vaneeâ Vines said in an email statement: &#8220;A key part of the protections that apply to both U.S. persons and citizens of other countries is the mandate that information be in support of a valid foreign intelligence requirement, and comply with U.S. Attorney General-approved procedures to protect privacy rights.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> \u003ca href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/\">revealed last week\u003c/a>, clandestine hacking has become central to the NSA&#8217;s mission in the past decade. The agency is working to aggressively scale its ability to break into computers to perform what it calls &#8220;computer network exploitation,&#8221; or CNE: the collection of intelligence from covertly infiltrated computer systems. Hacking into the computers of sys admins is particularly controversial because unlike conventional targets â people who are regarded as threats â sys admins are not suspected of any wrongdoing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a post calling sys admins &#8220;a means to an end,&#8221; the NSA employee writes, &#8220;Up front, sys admins generally are not my end target. My end target is the extremist/terrorist or government official that happens to be using the network some admin takes care of.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The first step, according to the posts, is to collect IP addresses that are believed to be linked to a networkâs sys admin. An IP address is a series of numbers allocated to every computer that connects to the Internet. Using this identifier, the NSA can then run an IP address through the vast amount of signals intelligence data, or SIGINT, that it collects every day, trying to match the IP address to personal accounts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;What we&#8217;d really like is a personal webmail or Facebook account to target,&#8221; one of the posts explains, presumably because, whereas IP addresses can be shared by multiple people, &#8220;alternative selectors&#8221; like a webmail or Facebook account can be linked to a particular target. You can &#8220;dumpster-dive for alternate selectors in the big SIGINT trash can&#8221; the author suggests. Or &#8220;pull out your wicked Google-fu&#8221; (slang for efficient Googling) to search for any &#8220;official and non-official e-mails&#8221; that the targets may have posted online.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once the agency believes it has identified a sys adminâs personal accounts, according to the posts, it can target them with its so-called \u003ca href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/\">QUANTUM hacking techniques\u003c/a>. The Snowden files reveal that the QUANTUM methods \u003ca href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/17/nsa-secretly-masqueraded-facebook-hack-computers-surveillance/\">have been used\u003c/a> to secretly inject surveillance malware into a Facebook page by sending malicious NSA data packets that appear to originate from a genuine Facebook server. This method tricks a targetâs computer into accepting the malicious packets, allowing the NSA to infect the targeted computer with a malware &#8220;implant&#8221; and gain unfettered access to the data stored on its hard drive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;Just pull those selectors, queue them up for QUANTUM, and proceed with the pwnage,&#8221; the author of the posts writes. (&#8220;Pwnage,&#8221; short for &#8220;pure ownage,&#8221; is gamer-speak for defeating opponents.) The author adds, triumphantly, &#8220;Yay! /throws confetti in the air.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In one case, these tactics were used by the NSA&#8217;s British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, to infiltrate the Belgian telecommunications company Belgacom. As \u003cem>Der Speigel \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/ghcq-targets-engineers-with-fake-linkedin-pages-a-932821.html\">revealed last year\u003c/a>, Belgacomâs network engineers were targeted by GCHQ in a QUANTUM mission named &#8220;Operation Socialist&#8221; â with the British agency hacking into the companyâs systems in an effort to monitor smartphones.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While targeting innocent sys admins may be surprising on its own, the &#8220;hunt sys admins&#8221; document reveals how the NSA network specialist secretly discussed building a &#8220;master list&#8221; of sys admins across the world, which would enable an attack to be initiated on one of them the moment their network was thought to be used by a person of interest. One post outlines how this process would make it easier for the NSAâs specialist hacking unit, Tailored Access Operations (TAO), to infiltrate networks and begin collecting, or &#8220;tasking,&#8221; data:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/03/go-CNE.png\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cdiv class='image-pad image-border default  image-shadow' style='border:1px solid #333;'>\u003cimg src='https://firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/03/go-CNE.png' alt='' title='' />\u003c/div>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Aside from offering up thoughts on covert hacking tactics, the author of these posts also provides a glimpse into internal employee complaints at the NSA. The posts describe how the agencyâs spies gripe about having &#8220;dismal infrastructure&#8221; and a &#8220;Big Data Problem&#8221; because of the massive volume of information being collected by NSA surveillance systems. For the author, however, the vast data troves are actually something to be enthusiastic about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;Our ability to pull bits out of random places of the Internet, bring them back to the mother-base to evaluate and build intelligence off of is just plain awesome!&#8221; the author writes. &#8220;One of the coolest things about it is \u003ci>how much\u003c/i> data we have at our fingertips.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Micah Lee contributed to this report.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>âââ\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Documents published with this article:\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/20/hunt-sys-admins/\">I Hunt Sys Admins\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2014-03-20T23:07:25+00:00","date_local":"2014-03-20T19:07:25+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"Across the world, people who work as system administrators keep computer networks in order â and this has turned them into unwitting targets of the NSA for simply doing their jobs.\u003c!--more--\>","excerpt_type":"","feature_header_background_color":"","feature_header_color":"","feature_header_layout":"","feature_image_mask":"","feature_interactive_url":"","feature_text_color":"","feature_title":"","featured_video_url":"","hide_featured_image":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"is_feature":"","language":{"code":"en","name":"English","slug":"english"},"language_related_post_ids":"","language_related_post_permalinks":"","language_related_posts":"","layout":"","link":"https://theintercept.com/2014/03/20/inside-nsa-secret-efforts-hunt-hack-system-administrators/","meta":{"links":[]},"mobile_thumbnail":null,"page_share_twitter_text":"","partner_feeds":null,"partnership":{"article_logo":"","article_logo_blurb":"","article_text_color":"","homepage_background_color":"","homepage_featured":"","homepage_logo":"","homepage_logo_blurb":"","homepage_text_color":"","module_type":"","partner":"","partner_url":"","video_module_post_description":"","video_module_post_image":"","video_module_post_title":""},"post_type":"post","prefer_talk_comments":false,"promo_image":{"ID":1855,"alt_text":"","content":"","credit":"","excerpt":"A secret document reveals how the NSA tracks down system administrators for surveillance.

href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/9/2930626/yochai-benkler-anonymous-cybersecurity-laws">a criminal menace</a>, warn of the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204059804577229390105521090">threats they allegedly pose</a>Â to critical infrastructure, andÂ <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/10/gary-mckinnon-hacking-prosecution-us">aggressively prosecute</a> them, but they are also secretly exploiting their information and expertise, according to top secret documents.</p>
<p>In some cases, the surveillance agenciesÂ are obtaining the content of emails by monitoring hackers as they breach emailÂ accounts, often without notifying the hacking victims of these breaches.Â &#8220;Hackers are stealing the emails of some of our targets&#8230; by collecting the hackers&#8217; &#8216;take,&#8217; we . . .Â Â get access to the emails themselves,&#8221; reads one top secret 2010 National Security Agency document.</p>
<p>These and other revelations about the intelligence agencies&#8217; reliance on hackers areÂ contained in documentsÂ provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The documentsâwhich come from theÂ U.K. Government Communications Headquarters agency and NSAâ<span style="line-height: 1.5">shed new light on the various means used by intelligence agencies to exploit hackers&#8217; successes and learn from their skills, while also raising questions about whether governments have overstated the threat posed by some hackers.</span></p>
<p>ByÂ looking out for hacking conductedÂ &#8220;both by state-sponsored and freelance hackers&#8221; and riding on the coattails of hackers, Western intelligence agenciesÂ have gathered what they regard as<strong>Â </strong>valuable content:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) and Menwith Hill Station (MHS) discovered and began exploiting a target-rich data set being stolen by hackers. The hackers&#8217; sophisticated email-stealing intrusion set is known as INTOLERANT. Of the traffic observed, nearly half contains category hits because the attackers are targeting email accounts of interest to the Intelligence Community. Although a relatively new data source, [Target Offices of Primary Interest] have already written multiple reports based on INTOLERANT collect.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hackers targeted a wide range of diplomatic corps, human rights and democracy activists and even journalists:</p>
<blockquote><p>INTOLERANT traffic is very organized. Each event is labeled to identify and categorize victims. Cyber attacks commonly apply descriptors to each victim &#8211; it helps herd victims and track which attacks succeed and which fail. Victim categories make INTOLERANT interesting:</p>
<p>A = Indian Diplomatic &amp; Indian Navy<br />
B = Central Asian diplomatic<br />
C = Chinese Human Rights Defenders<br />
D = Tibetan Pro-Democracy Personalities<br />
E = Uighur Activists<br />
F = European Special Rep to Afghanistan and Indian photo-journalism<br />
G = Tibetan Government in Exile</p></blockquote>
<p>In those cases, the NSA and its partner agencies in the United Kingdom and Canada were unable to determine the identity of the hackers who collected the data, but suspect a state sponsor &#8220;based on the level of sophistication and the victim set.&#8221;</p>
<p>In instances where hacking may compromise data from the U.S. and U.K. governments, or their allies, notification was given to the &#8220;relevant parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a separate document, GCHQ officials discuss plans to use open source discussions among hackers to improve their own knowledge. &#8220;Analysts are potentially missing out on valuable open source information relating to cyber defence because of an inability to easily keep up to date with specific blogs and Twitter sources,&#8221; according to one document.</p>
<p>GCHQ created a program called LOVELY HORSE to monitor and index public discussion by hackers on Twitter and other social media. The Twitter accounts designated for collection in the 2012Â document:<br />
<div class='img-wrap align-right  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> <a href="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/02/lovely-horse-doc.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13039 size-article-medium" src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/02/lovely-horse-doc-540x431.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90" alt="" width="540" height="431" /></a> </div></p>
<p>These accounts represent aÂ cross section of the hacker community and security scene. In addition to monitoring multiple accounts affiliated with Anonymous, GCHQ monitored the <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmitnick">tweets of Kevin Mitnick</a>, who was sent to prison in 1999 for various computer and fraud related offenses. The U.S. Government once characterized Mitnick as one of the world&#8217;s most villainous hackers, butÂ he has since turned security consultant and <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/kevin-mitnick-selling-zero-day-exploits/">exploit broker</a>.</p>
<p>Among others, GCHQ monitored the tweets of reverse-engineer and Google employee, <a href="https://twitter.com/halvarflake">Thomas Dullien</a>.Â Fellow GooglerÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/taviso">Tavis Ormandy</a>, from Google&#8217;s vulnerability research team Project Zero, is featured on the list, along with other well known offensive security researchers, including Metasploit&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hdmoore">HD Moore</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/egyp7">James Lee (aka Egypt)</a> together with <a href="https://twitter.com/dinodaizovi">Dino Dai Zovi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexsotirov"> Alexander Sotirov</a>, who at the time both worked for New York-based offensive securityÂ company, Trail of Bits (Dai Zovi has since taken up a position at payment company, Square). The list also includes notable anti-forensics and operational security expert &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq">The Grugq.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>GCHQ monitored the tweets of former NSA agents <a href="https://twitter.com/daveaitel">Dave Aitel</a> and <a href="0xcharlie">Charlie Miller</a>, and former Air Force intelligence officer <a href="https://twitter.com/taosecurity">Richard Bejtlich</a> as well as French exploit vendor, <a href="https://twitter.com/vupen">VUPEN</a> (who sold a one year <a href="https://muckrock.s3.amazonaws.com/foia_files/9-11-13_MR6593_RES.pdf">subscription</a> for its binary analysis and exploits service to the NSA in 2012).</p>
<p>The GCHQ document statesÂ that theyÂ &#8220;currently have a list of around 60 blog and Twitter sources&#8221; that were identified by analysts for collection.Â A prototype of the LOVELY HORSE program ensured that &#8220;Twitter and (and subject to legal/security approval) blog content [was] manually scraped and uploaded to GCDesk.&#8221; A later version would upload content in real time.</p>
<p>Several of the accounts to be mined for expertise are associated with the hactivist collective Anonymous. Documents <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/07/14/jtrig-tools-techniques/">previously published</a> by <em>The Intercept </em><a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/14/manipulating-online-polls-ways-british-spies-seek-control-internet/">revealÂ extensive</a>, and <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">sometimes extreme</a>, <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/snowden_anonymous_nbc_document.pdf">tactics employed</a> by GCHQ to infiltrate, discredit and disrupt that group. The agency employed some of the same hacker methods against Anonymous (e.g., mass denial of service) as governments have prosecuted Anonymous for using.</p>
<p>A separate GCHQ document details the open-source sites monitored and collected by the agency, including blogs, websites, chat venues and Twitter. It describes Twitter monitoring undertaken for &#8220;real-time alerting to new security issues reported by known security professionals, or planned activity by hacking groups, e.g. Anonymous.&#8221; The agency planned to expand its monitoring and aggregationÂ program to a wide range of web locations, including IRC chat rooms and Pastebin, where &#8220;an increasing number of tip-offs are coming from . . . as this is where many hackers anonymously advertise and promote their exploits, by publishing stolen information.&#8221;</p>
<p>One classified document casts serious doubt on warnings about the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/9/2930626/yochai-benkler-anonymous-cybersecurity-laws">threat</a> posed by Anonymous (in early 2012 then-<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204059804577229390105521090">NSA chief Keith Alexander reportedly warned</a> that Anonymous could shut down parts of the power grid).</p>
<p>That document, containing &#8220;talking points&#8221; prepared by Jessica Vielhuber of the National Intelligence Council in September 2011Â for a NATO meeting on cyber-threats, describes the threat from Anonymous as relatively small.Â &#8220;Although &#8216;hacktivist&#8217; groups such as Anonymous have made headlines recently with their theft of NATO information, the threat posed by such activity is minimal relative to that of nation-states,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>In response to <em>TheÂ Intercept</em>&#8216;s questions, an agency spokesperson said that &#8220;NSA will not comment on theÂ Intercept&#8217;s speculation,&#8221; and noted that NSA &#8220;defends the nation and our allies from foreign threats while going to great lengths to safeguard privacy and civil liberties.&#8221; The spokesperson added that &#8220;over the last year, at the president&#8217;s direction, the U.S. intelligence community engaged in an unprecedented effort to examine and strengthen the privacy and civil liberty protections afforded to all people, regardless of nationality.&#8221;</p>
<p>GCHQ declined to answer questions for this article, or to comment on theÂ programs involved, but instead provided a boiler plate statement, which says the agency&#8217;s work is legal and subject to government oversight. &#8220;It is longstanding policy that we do not comment onÂ intelligence matters,&#8221; the agency notes.</p>

Prior to co-founding The Intercept, Glenn&#8217;s column was featured in theÂ GuardianÂ and Salon. He was the debut winner, along with Amy Goodman, of the Park Center I.F. Stone Award for Independent Journalism in 2008, and also received the 2010 Online Journalism Award for his investigative work on the abusive detention conditions of Chelsea Manning. For his 2013 NSA reporting, he received the George Polk Award for National Security Reporting; the Gannett Foundation Award for investigative journalism and the Gannett Foundation Watchdog Journalism Award; the Esso Premio for Excellence in Investigative Reporting in Brazil (he was the first non-Brazilian to win), and the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#8217;s Pioneer Award.

<p>The principal problem for Democrats is that so <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/business/trump-television-ratings-liberals.html">many media figures</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/blue-detectives?utm_term=.tj87me2jd#.lnL3AvPBe">online charlatans</a>Â are personally benefiting from feeding the base increasingly unhinged, fact-free conspiracies &#8212; just as <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/07/leading-putin-critic-warns-of-xenophobic-conspiracy-theories-drowning-u-s-discourse-and-helping-trump/">right-wing media polemicists did</a> after both Bill Clinton and Obama were elected &#8212; that there are now millions of partisan soldiers absolutely convinced of a Trump/Russia conspiracy for which, at least as of now, there is no evidence.

<div class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> <a href="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/03/maddow2017-1489678100.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90"><img class="aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-117660" src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/03/maddow2017-1489678100.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=540&h=511" alt="" /></a> </div>
<p>Key Democratic officials are clearly worried about the expectations that have been purposely stoked and are now trying to tamp them down. Many of them have tried to signal that the beliefs the base has been led to adopt have no basis in reason or evidence.</p>
<p>The latest official to throw cold water on the MSNBC-led circus is President Obama&#8217;s former acting CIA chief Michael Morell. What makes him particularly notable in this context is that Morell was one of Clinton&#8217;s most vocal CIA surrogates. In August, he not only endorsed Clinton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/opinion/campaign-stops/i-ran-the-cia-now-im-endorsing-hillary-clinton.html">in the pages of the New York Times</a> but also became the first high official to explicitly accuse Trump of disloyalty, claiming, &#8220;In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on Wednesday night, Morell <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-ally-says-smoke-no-fire-no-russia-trump-collusion-n734176">appeared</a> at an intelligence community forum to &#8220;cast doubt&#8221; on &#8220;allegations that members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.&#8221; &#8220;On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire at all,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;There&#8217;s no little campfire, there&#8217;s no little candle, there&#8217;s no spark. And there&#8217;s a lot of people looking for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s former CIA chiefÂ also cast serious doubt on the credibility of the infamous, explosive &#8220;dossier&#8221; originally published by BuzzFeed, saying that its author, Christopher Steele, paid intermediaries to talk to the sources for it.Â The dossier, he said, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t take you anywhere, I don&#8217;t think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morell&#8217;s comments echo the categorical remarks by Obama&#8217;s top national security official, James Clapper, who told Meet the Press last week that during the time he was Obama&#8217;s DNI,Â <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article136600203.html">he saw no evidence</a>Â to support claims of a Trump/Russia conspiracy. &#8220;We had no evidence of such collusion,&#8221; Clapper stated unequivocally. Unlike Morell, who left his official CIA position in 2013 but remains very integrated into the intelligence community, Clapper was Obama&#8217;s DNI until just seven weeks ago, leaving on January 20.</p>
<p>Perhaps most revealing of all are the Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee &#8212; charged with investigating these matters &#8212; who <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alimwatkins/the-people-investigating-russias-role-in-the-election-worry?utm_term=.ndWAwGXmv#.qa2z2rBPd">recently told BuzzFeed</a> how petrified they are of what the Democratic base will do if they do not find evidence of collusion, as they now suspect will likely be the case. &#8220;Thereâs a tangible frustration over what one official called &#8216;wildly inflated&#8217; expectations surrounding the panelâs fledgling investigation,&#8221; BuzzFeed&#8217;s Ali Watkins wrote.</p>
<p>Moreover, &#8220;several committee sources grudgingly say, it feels as though the investigation will be seen as a sham if the Senate doesnât find a silver bullet connecting Trump and Russian intelligence operatives.&#8221; One member told Watkins: &#8220;I donât think the conclusions are going to meet peopleâs expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>What makes all of this most significant is that officials like Clapper and Morell are trained disinformation agents; Clapper in particular has proven he will lie to advance his interests. Yet even with all the incentive to do so, they are refusing to claim there is evidence of such collusion; in fact, they are expressly urging people to stop thinking it exists. As even the law recognizes, statements thatÂ otherwise lack credibility become more believable when they are <a href="https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/statement-against-interest/">ones madeÂ &#8220;against interest.&#8221; </a></p>
<p>Media figures have similarly begun trying to tamp down expectations. Ben Smith, the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed, which published the Steele dossier, published <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/beware-the-false-temptations-of-the-russia-story?utm_term=.xon3Mqxea#.aeOQ84AOJ">an article yesterday warning</a>Â that the Democratic base&#8217;s expectation of a smoking gun &#8220;is so strong that Twitter and cable news are full of the theories of what my colleague Charlie Warzel <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/blue-detectives">calls</a> the Blue Detectives â the leftâs new version of Glenn Beck, digital blackboards full of lines and arrows.&#8221; Smith added: &#8220;It is also a simple fact that while news of Russian actions on Trumpâs behalf is clear, hard details of coordination between his aides and Putinâs havenât emerged.&#8221; And Smith&#8217;sÂ core warning is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trumpâs critics last year were horrified at the rise of âfake newsâ and the specter of a politics shaped by alternative facts, predominantly on the right. They need to be careful now not to succumb to the same delusional temptations as their political adversaries, and not to sink into a filter bubble which, after all, draws its strength not from conservative or progressive politics but from human nature.</p>
<p>And those of us covering the story and the stew of real information, fantasy, and â now â forgery around it need to continue to report and think clearly about what we know and what we donât, and to resist the sugar high that comes with telling people exactly what they want to hear.</p></blockquote>
<p>For so long, Democrats demonized and smearedÂ anyone trying to inject basic reason, rationality, and skepticism into this Trump/Russia discourse by labeling them all Kremlin agents and Putin lovers. Just this week, the Center for American Progress released a report using the language of treason to <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2017/03/15/428074/russias-5th-column/">announce the existence of a &#8220;Fifth Column&#8221;</a> in the U.S. that serves Russia (similar to <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/842085274507186176">Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s notorious 2001 decree</a> that anyone opposing the war on terror composed an anti-American &#8220;Fifth Column&#8221;), while John McCain listened to Rand Paul express doubts about the wisdom of NATO further expanding to include Montenegro and then <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/15/john-mccain-rand-paul-is-now-working-for-vladimir-putin.html?via=desktop&amp;source=copyurl">promptly announced</a>: &#8220;Paul is working for Vladimir Putin.&#8221;</p>
<p>But with serious doubts &#8212; and fears &#8212; now emerging about what the Democratic base has been led to believeÂ byÂ self-interested carnival barkers and partisan hacks, there is a sudden, concerted effort to rein in the excesses of this story. With so many people now doing this, it will be increasingly difficult to smear them all as traitors and Russian loyalists, but it may be far too little, too late, given the pitched hysteria that has been deliberately cultivated around these issues for months. Many DemocratsÂ have reached the classic stage of deranged conspiracists where evidence that disproves the theory is viewed as further proof of its existence, and those pointing to it are instantly deemed suspect.</p>
<div class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> <a href="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/03/buzz1-1489678254.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90"><img class="aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-117661" src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/03/buzz1-1489678254.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=540&h=463" alt="" /></a> </div>
<p>A formal, credible investigation into all these questions, where the evidence is publicly disclosed, is still urgently needed. That&#8217;s trueÂ primarily so that conspiracies no longer linger and these questions are resolved by facts rather than agenda-driven anonymous leaks from the CIA and cable news hosts required to feed a partisan mob.</p>
<p>Itâs certainly possible to envision an indictment of a low-level operative like Carter Page, or the prosecution of someone like Paul Manafort on matters unrelated to hacking, but the silver bullet that Democrats have been led to expect will sink Trump appears further away than ever.</p>
<p>But given the way these Russia conspiracies have drowned out other critical issues being virtually ignored under the Trump presidency, it&#8217;s vital that everything be done now to make clear what is based in evidence and what is based in partisan delusions. And most of what the Democratic base has been fed for the last six months by their unhinged stable of media, online, and party leaders hasÂ decisively fallen into the latter category, as even their own officials are now desperately trying to warn.</p>

His most recent book, âNo Place to Hide,â is about the U.S. surveillance state and his experiences reporting on the Snowden documents around the world. Prior to co-founding The Intercept, Glenn&#8217;s column was featured in theÂ GuardianÂ and Salon. He was the debut winner, along with Amy Goodman, of the Park Center I.F. Stone Award for Independent Journalism in 2008, and also received the 2010 Online Journalism Award for his investigative work on the abusive detention conditions of Chelsea Manning. For his 2013 NSA reporting, he received the George Polk Award for National Security Reporting; the Gannett Foundation Award for investigative journalism and the Gannett Foundation Watchdog Journalism Award; the Esso Premio for Excellence in Investigative Reporting in Brazil (he was the first non-Brazilian to win), and the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#8217;s Pioneer Award. Along with Laura Poitras, Foreign Policy magazine named him one of the top 100 Global Thinkers for 2013.

Many of them have tried to signal that the beliefs the base has been led to adopt have no basis in reason or evidence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The latest official to throw cold water on the MSNBC-led circus is President Obama&#8217;s former acting CIA chief Michael Morell. What makes him particularly notable in this context is that Morell was one of Clinton&#8217;s most vocal CIA surrogates. In August, he not only endorsed Clinton \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/opinion/campaign-stops/i-ran-the-cia-now-im-endorsing-hillary-clinton.html\">in the pages of the New York Times\u003c/a> but also became the first high official to explicitly accuse Trump of disloyalty, claiming, &#8220;In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But on Wednesday night, Morell \u003ca href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-ally-says-smoke-no-fire-no-russia-trump-collusion-n734176\">appeared\u003c/a> at an intelligence community forum to &#8220;cast doubt&#8221; on &#8220;allegations that members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.&#8221; &#8220;On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire at all,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;There&#8217;s no little campfire, there&#8217;s no little candle, there&#8217;s no spark. And there&#8217;s a lot of people looking for it.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Obama&#8217;s former CIA chiefÂ also cast serious doubt on the credibility of the infamous, explosive &#8220;dossier&#8221; originally published by BuzzFeed, saying that its author, Christopher Steele, paid intermediaries to talk to the sources for it.Â The dossier, he said, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t take you anywhere, I don&#8217;t think.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Morell&#8217;s comments echo the categorical remarks by Obama&#8217;s top national security official, James Clapper, who told Meet the Press last week that during the time he was Obama&#8217;s DNI,Â \u003ca href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article136600203.html\">he saw no evidence\u003c/a>Â to support claims of a Trump/Russia conspiracy. &#8220;We had no evidence of such collusion,&#8221; Clapper stated unequivocally. Unlike Morell, who left his official CIA position in 2013 but remains very integrated into the intelligence community, Clapper was Obama&#8217;s DNI until just seven weeks ago, leaving on January 20.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Perhaps most revealing of all are the Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee &#8212; charged with investigating these matters &#8212; who \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alimwatkins/the-people-investigating-russias-role-in-the-election-worry?utm_term=.ndWAwGXmv#.qa2z2rBPd\">recently told BuzzFeed\u003c/a> how petrified they are of what the Democratic base will do if they do not find evidence of collusion, as they now suspect will likely be the case. &#8220;Thereâs a tangible frustration over what one official called &#8216;wildly inflated&#8217; expectations surrounding the panelâs fledgling investigation,&#8221; BuzzFeed&#8217;s Ali Watkins wrote.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Moreover, &#8220;several committee sources grudgingly say, it feels as though the investigation will be seen as a sham if the Senate doesnât find a silver bullet connecting Trump and Russian intelligence operatives.&#8221; One member told Watkins: &#8220;I donât think the conclusions are going to meet peopleâs expectations.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What makes all of this most significant is that officials like Clapper and Morell are trained disinformation agents; Clapper in particular has proven he will lie to advance his interests. Yet even with all the incentive to do so, they are refusing to claim there is evidence of such collusion; in fact, they are expressly urging people to stop thinking it exists. As even the law recognizes, statements thatÂ otherwise lack credibility become more believable when they are \u003ca href=\"https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/statement-against-interest/\">ones madeÂ &#8220;against interest.&#8221; \u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Media figures have similarly begun trying to tamp down expectations. Ben Smith, the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed, which published the Steele dossier, published \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/beware-the-false-temptations-of-the-russia-story?utm_term=.xon3Mqxea#.aeOQ84AOJ\">an article yesterday warning\u003c/a>Â that the Democratic base&#8217;s expectation of a smoking gun &#8220;is so strong that Twitter and cable news are full of the theories of what my colleague Charlie Warzel \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/blue-detectives\">calls\u003c/a> the Blue Detectives â the leftâs new version of Glenn Beck, digital blackboards full of lines and arrows.&#8221; Smith added: &#8220;It is also a simple fact that while news of Russian actions on Trumpâs behalf is clear, hard details of coordination between his aides and Putinâs havenât emerged.&#8221; And Smith&#8217;sÂ core warning is this:\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\u003cp>Trumpâs critics last year were horrified at the rise of âfake newsâ and the specter of a politics shaped by alternative facts, predominantly on the right. They need to be careful now not to succumb to the same delusional temptations as their political adversaries, and not to sink into a filter bubble which, after all, draws its strength not from conservative or progressive politics but from human nature.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And those of us covering the story and the stew of real information, fantasy, and â now â forgery around it need to continue to report and think clearly about what we know and what we donât, and to resist the sugar high that comes with telling people exactly what they want to hear.\u003c/p>\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>For so long, Democrats demonized and smearedÂ anyone trying to inject basic reason, rationality, and skepticism into this Trump/Russia discourse by labeling them all Kremlin agents and Putin lovers. Just this week, the Center for American Progress released a report using the language of treason to \u003ca href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2017/03/15/428074/russias-5th-column/\">announce the existence of a &#8220;Fifth Column&#8221;\u003c/a> in the U.S. that serves Russia (similar to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/842085274507186176\">Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s notorious 2001 decree\u003c/a> that anyone opposing the war on terror composed an anti-American &#8220;Fifth Column&#8221;), while John McCain listened to Rand Paul express doubts about the wisdom of NATO further expanding to include Montenegro and then \u003ca href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/15/john-mccain-rand-paul-is-now-working-for-vladimir-putin.html?via=desktop&amp;source=copyurl\">promptly announced\u003c/a>: &#8220;Paul is working for Vladimir Putin.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But with serious doubts &#8212; and fears &#8212; now emerging about what the Democratic base has been led to believeÂ byÂ self-interested carnival barkers and partisan hacks, there is a sudden, concerted effort to rein in the excesses of this story. With so many people now doing this, it will be increasingly difficult to smear them all as traitors and Russian loyalists, but it may be far too little, too late, given the pitched hysteria that has been deliberately cultivated around these issues for months. Many DemocratsÂ have reached the classic stage of deranged conspiracists where evidence that disproves the theory is viewed as further proof of its existence, and those pointing to it are instantly deemed suspect.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/03/buzz1-1489678254.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-117661\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/03/buzz1-1489678254-540x463.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\n\u003cp>A formal, credible investigation into all these questions, where the evidence is publicly disclosed, is still urgently needed. That&#8217;s trueÂ primarily so that conspiracies no longer linger and these questions are resolved by facts rather than agenda-driven anonymous leaks from the CIA and cable news hosts required to feed a partisan mob.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Itâs certainly possible to envision an indictment of a low-level operative like Carter Page, or the prosecution of someone like Paul Manafort on matters unrelated to hacking, but the silver bullet that Democrats have been led to expect will sink Trump appears further away than ever.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But given the way these Russia conspiracies have drowned out other critical issues being virtually ignored under the Trump presidency, it&#8217;s vital that everything be done now to make clear what is based in evidence and what is based in partisan delusions. And most of what the Democratic base has been fed for the last six months by their unhinged stable of media, online, and party leaders hasÂ decisively fallen into the latter category, as even their own officials are now desperately trying to warn.\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2017-03-16T15:41:36+00:00","date_local":"2017-03-16T11:41:36+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"So many media figures and online charlatans are personally benefiting from feeding the Democratic base unhinged conspiracies.","excerpt_type":"default","feature_header_background_color":"","feature_header_color":"","feature_header_layout":"default","feature_image_mask":"","feature_interactive_url":"","feature_text_color":"","feature_title":"Featured News","featured_video_url":"","hide_featured_image":true,"inline_featured_image":false,"is_feature":"0","language":{"code":"en","name":"English","slug":"english"},"language_related_post_ids":"","language_related_post_permalinks":"","language_related_posts":"","layout":"default","link":"https://theintercept.com/2017/03/16/key-democratic-officials-now-warning-base-not-to-expect-evidence-of-trumprussia-collusion/","meta":{"links":[]},"mobile_thumbnail":null,"page_share_twitter_text":"","partner_feeds":[{"name":"Spoken Layer","slug":"spoken-layer"},{"name":"Uproxx","slug":"uproxx"}],"partnership":{"article_logo":"","article_logo_blurb":"In partnership with","article_text_color":"#AAAAAA","homepage_background_color":"#EEEEEE","homepage_featured":"0","homepage_logo":"","homepage_logo_blurb":"In partnership with","homepage_text_color":"#111111","module_type":"default","partner":"default","partner_url":"","video_module_post_description":"","video_module_post_image":"","video_module_post_title":""},"post_status":"publish","post_type":"post","prefer_talk_comments":false,"promo_image":{"ID":117743,"alt_text":"WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 02:  Former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell arrives for testimony before the House Select Intelligence Committee April 2, 2014 in Washington, DC.

<p class='caption source' style=''>Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></div><u>If you click</u> enough times through the website of Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, you&#8217;ll reach a <a href="https://www.saudiaramco.com/en/making-a-difference/planet/climateinitiative">quiet section</a>Â called &#8220;Addressing the climate challenge.&#8221;Â In this part of the website, the fossil fuel monolith claims, &#8220;Our contributions to the climate challenge are tangible expressions of our ethos, supported by company policies, of conducting our business in a way that addresses the climate challenge.&#8221; This is meaningless, of course â as is the announcement <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">Mark Zuckerberg</a> made today aboutÂ his newfound &#8220;privacy-focused vision for social networking.&#8221; Don&#8217;t be fooled by either.</p>
<p>Like Saudi Aramco, Facebook inhabits a world in which it is constantly screamed at,Â with good reason,Â for being a contributor to the world&#8217;s worsening state. Writing a vague blog post, however, is far easier than completely restructuring the way your enormous corporation does business and reckoning with the damage it&#8217;s caused.</p>
<blockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>Promising to someday soon forfeit to your ability to eavesdrop on over 2 billion peopleÂ doesn&#8217;tÂ exactly make you eligible for sainthood in 2019.</blockquote>
<p>And so here we are: &#8220;As I think about the future of the internet, I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today&#8217;s open platforms,&#8221; Zuckerberg writes in his road-to-Damascus revelation about personal privacy. The roughly 3,000-word manifesto reads asÂ though Facebook is fundamentally realigning itselfÂ asÂ a privacy champion â a company that will no longer track what you read, buy, see, watch, and hear in order to sell companies the opportunity to intervene in your future acts. But, it turns out, the new &#8220;privacy-focused&#8221; Facebook involves only one change: the enabling of end-to-end encryption across the company&#8217;s instant messaging services. Such a tech shift would prevent anyone, even Facebook, outside of chat participants from reading your messages.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Although the move is laudable â and will be a boon for dissident Facebook chatters in countries where government surveillance is a real, perpetual risk â promising to someday soon forfeit to your ability to eavesdrop on over 2 billion peopleÂ doesn&#8217;t exactly make you eligible for sainthood in 2019. It doesn&#8217;t help that Zuckerberg&#8217;s post is completely absent of details beyond a plan to implement these encryption changes &#8220;over the next few years&#8221; â which is particularly silly considering Facebook <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-privacy-optics-clear-history-zuckerberg">has yet to implement</a> privacy features promised in the wake of its previous mega-scandals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that many people don&#8217;t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform,&#8221; reads Zuckerberg&#8217;s awakening. Count me into &#8220;many people,&#8221; just like I&#8217;m a skeptic of Saudi Aramco&#8217;s attempt to pre-empt criticism: &#8220;For some, the idea of an oil and gas company positively contributing to the climate challenge is a contradiction. We donât think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The skepticism of Facebook is warranted. To pick just one of many examples, the company,Â as <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/06/26/google-and-facebook-are-quietly-fighting-californias-privacy-rights-initiative-emails-reveal/">The Intercept recently reported</a>, is involved behind the scenes in fighting attempts to pass more stringent privacy laws in California.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, this is a dramatic 3,000-word opus, but only about one new privacy feature, to be released at some unknown future point. On the other hand, Facebook has a long history to consider:Â It&#8217;s a company whose business model relies entirely on worldwide data mining. Facebook may someday offer end-to-end chats between WhatsApp and Messenger users â whichÂ would be great! â but there&#8217;s no sign the company would ever expand such encryption beyond instant messages, because it would destroy the company. For everything Facebook protects with end-to-end encryption, that&#8217;s one less thing Facebook can comb for behavioral data, consumer preferences, and so forth.</p>

<p>Your chats may be secure, but that will do virtually nothing to change how Facebook follows and monitors your life, on and offline. Facebook could, say, encrypt the contents of your profile or your photo albums so that no one but your friends could decrypt that information â but then how would they sell ads against it?</p>
<p>The unblogged truth,Â which Zuckerberg knows as well as anyone else, is that a &#8220;privacy-focused vision for social networking&#8221; looks nothing like Facebook; more to the point, it would resemble Facebook&#8217;sÂ negative image. The company will wave its arms around this &#8220;announcement&#8221; and point to it whenever its next privacy screw-up occurs â likely sometime later today.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t mistake this attempt at pantomiming contrition and techno-progress as anything more than theater. And don&#8217;t mistake a long blog post about privacy for anything more than many, many words from a man who knows he&#8217;s in trouble.</p>

Writing a vague blog post, however, is far easier than completely restructuring the way your enormous corporation does business and reckoning with the damage it&#8217;s caused.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>Promising to someday soon forfeit to your ability to eavesdrop on over 2 billion peopleÂ doesn&#8217;tÂ exactly make you eligible for sainthood in 2019.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>And so here we are: &#8220;As I think about the future of the internet, I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today&#8217;s open platforms,&#8221; Zuckerberg writes in his road-to-Damascus revelation about personal privacy. The roughly 3,000-word manifesto reads asÂ though Facebook is fundamentally realigning itselfÂ asÂ a privacy champion â a company that will no longer track what you read, buy, see, watch, and hear in order to sell companies the opportunity to intervene in your future acts. But, it turns out, the new &#8220;privacy-focused&#8221; Facebook involves only one change: the enabling of end-to-end encryption across the company&#8217;s instant messaging services. Such a tech shift would prevent anyone, even Facebook, outside of chat participants from reading your messages.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Although the move is laudable â and will be a boon for dissident Facebook chatters in countries where government surveillance is a real, perpetual risk â promising to someday soon forfeit to your ability to eavesdrop on over 2 billion peopleÂ doesn&#8217;t exactly make you eligible for sainthood in 2019. It doesn&#8217;t help that Zuckerberg&#8217;s post is completely absent of details beyond a plan to implement these encryption changes &#8220;over the next few years&#8221; â which is particularly silly considering Facebook \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-privacy-optics-clear-history-zuckerberg\">has yet to implement\u003c/a> privacy features promised in the wake of its previous mega-scandals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;I understand that many people don&#8217;t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform,&#8221; reads Zuckerberg&#8217;s awakening. Count me into &#8220;many people,&#8221; just like I&#8217;m a skeptic of Saudi Aramco&#8217;s attempt to pre-empt criticism: &#8220;For some, the idea of an oil and gas company positively contributing to the climate challenge is a contradiction. We donât think so.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The skepticism of Facebook is warranted. To pick just one of many examples, the company,Â as \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/06/26/google-and-facebook-are-quietly-fighting-californias-privacy-rights-initiative-emails-reveal/\">The Intercept recently reported\u003c/a>, is involved behind the scenes in fighting attempts to pass more stringent privacy laws in California.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What&#8217;s more, this is a dramatic 3,000-word opus, but only about one new privacy feature, to be released at some unknown future point. On the other hand, Facebook has a long history to consider:Â It&#8217;s a company whose business model relies entirely on worldwide data mining. Facebook may someday offer end-to-end chats between WhatsApp and Messenger users â whichÂ would be great! â but there&#8217;s no sign the company would ever expand such encryption beyond instant messages, because it would destroy the company. For everything Facebook protects with end-to-end encryption, that&#8217;s one less thing Facebook can comb for behavioral data, consumer preferences, and so forth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\">\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>Your chats may be secure, but that will do virtually nothing to change how Facebook follows and monitors your life, on and offline. Facebook could, say, encrypt the contents of your profile or your photo albums so that no one but your friends could decrypt that information â but then how would they sell ads against it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The unblogged truth,Â which Zuckerberg knows as well as anyone else, is that a &#8220;privacy-focused vision for social networking&#8221; looks nothing like Facebook; more to the point, it would resemble Facebook&#8217;sÂ negative image. The company will wave its arms around this &#8220;announcement&#8221; and point to it whenever its next privacy screw-up occurs â likely sometime later today.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Don&#8217;t mistake this attempt at pantomiming contrition and techno-progress as anything more than theater. And don&#8217;t mistake a long blog post about privacy for anything more than many, many words from a man who knows he&#8217;s in trouble.\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2019-03-06T21:45:36+00:00","date_local":"2019-03-06T16:45:36+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"Facebookâs promise to build a âprivacy-focused platformâ is little more than a hollow reaction to recent PR disasters.

the encryption on a number of âhigh potentialâ virtual private networks, including those of media organization Al Jazeera, the Iraqi military and internet service organizations, and a number of airline reservation systems, according to a <a href="https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/4755596-efforts-against-virtual-private-networks-bear">March 2006 NSA document</a>.</p>
<p>A virtual private network, or VPN, uses an encrypted connection to enable users to go over the internet and connect to a private network, such as a corporate intranet. This allows an organizationâs staff to access internal services like file-sharing servers or private wikis without having to physically be in the office.</p>
<p>The NSA&#8217;s ability to crack into sensitive VPNs belonging to large organizations, all the way back in 2006, raises broader questions about the security of such networks. Many consumers pay for access to VPNs in order toÂ mask the origin of their internet traffic from the sites they visit, hide their surfing habits from their internet service providers, and to protect against eavesdroppers on public Wi-Fi networks.</p>
<p>The fact that the NSA spied on Al Jazeeraâs communications was <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nsa-spied-on-al-jazeera-communications-snowden-document-a-919681.html">reported by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel</a> in 2013, but that reporting did not mention that the spying was accomplished through the NSAâs compromise of Al Jazeeraâs VPN. During the Bush administration, high-ranking U.S. officials <a href="https://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php">criticized</a> Al Jazeera, accusing the Qatar-based news organization of having an anti-American bias, including because it broadcasted taped messages from Osama bin Laden.</p>
<blockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>&#8220;Both protocols offer a zillion configurable options, which is a source of a lot of the vulnerabilities.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>At the time, Al Jazeera defended itself against this criticism, insisting that its reporting was objective. &#8220;Osama bin Laden, like it or not, is a party to this present crisis,&#8221; news editor Ahmed Al Sheikh <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1591361.stm">told</a> the BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1591361.stm">in 2001</a>. &#8220;If we said that we were not going to allow him the air time, then we would have lost our integrity and objectivity and our coverage of the story would have become unbalanced.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the document, contained in the cache of materials provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the NSA also compromised VPNs used by airline reservation systems Iran Air, âParaguayan SABRE,â Russian airline Aeroflot, and âRussian Galileo.â Sabre and Galileo are both privately operated, centralized computer systems that facilitate travel transactions like booking airline tickets. Collectively, they are used by hundreds of airlines around the world.</p>
<p>In Iraq, the NSA compromised VPNs at the Ministries of Defense and the Interior; the Ministry of Defense had been established by the U.S. in 2004 after the prior iteration was dissolved. Exploitation against the ministriesâ VPNs appears to have occurred at roughly the same time as a broader âall-out campaign to penetrate Iraqi networks,â <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/09/13/sloppy-u-s-spies-misused-covert-network-for-personal-shopping-and-other-stories-from-internal-nsa-documents/#spying-on-iraq">described by an NSA staffer</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/09/13/sloppy-u-s-spies-misused-covert-network-for-personal-shopping-and-other-stories-from-internal-nsa-documents/#spying-on-iraq">in 2005</a>.</p>
<p>âAlthough VPNs pose special challenges for SIGINT (signals intelligence) collection and processing, weâve recently had notable success in exploiting these communications,â wrote the author of the document, an article for the internal NSA news site SIDtoday. The author added that the NSAâs Network Analysis Center had been focusing on âVPN SIGINT Development (SIGDev) for over three years now, and the investment is paying off!â The article does not say what VPN technology any of the targets used, nor does it give any technical details on how the NSA broke the encryption on them.</p>
<p>The technical details that describe how the NSA exploits VPNs are a closely-guarded secret, according to <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2018/08/15/nsa-sidtoday-giving-answers-keeping-secrets">another SIDtoday article,</a> from December 2006. âExploiting VPNs makes use of some of the newest state-of-the-art techniques,â the article stated, âand because of this, the exploitation details are held closely and generally not available to field sites.â The author went on to describe a tool called VIVIDDREAM that lets analysts who discover new VPNs test whether the NSA has the capability to exploit it, all without revealing to the analyst any sensitive information about how the exploit works.</p>
<p>Documents provided to news organizations by Snowden do not conclusively list which VPN technologies have been compromised by the NSA and which have not. However, there have been a number of news reports about the NSAâs VPN hacking capabilities based on these documents, and cryptographers who have reviewed them have come up with some educated guesses.</p>
<p>In 2014, The Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/">reported</a> on the NSAâs plans, dated August 2009, to use an automated system called TURBINE to covertly infect millions of computers with malware. The revelations described a piece of NSA malware called HAMMERSTEIN, installed on routers that VPN traffic traverses. The malware was able to forward VPN traffic that uses the IPSec protocol back to the NSA to decrypt. However, the documents did not explain precisely how the decryption occurred.</p>
<p>Later that year, Der Spiegel <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/inside-the-nsa-s-war-on-internet-security-a-1010361.html">published 17 documents</a> from the Snowden archive related to the NSAâs attacks against VPNs, many of them providing more details about TURBINE, HAMMERSTEIN, and related programs.</p>
<p>There are many different VPN protocols in use, some of them <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/211329/which-is-the-best-vpn-protocol-pptp-vs.-openvpn-vs.-l2tpipsec-vs.-sstp/">known</a> to be less secure than others, and each can be configured in ways to make them more or less secure. One, Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, âis old and insecure and there are a bunch of known security vulnerabilities since forever,â Nadia Heninger, cryptography researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, told me in an email. âI would not at all be shocked if these were being exploited in the wild.â</p>
<p>The NSA also appears to have, at least in some situations, broken the security of another VPN protocol, Internet Protocol Security, or IPSec, according to the Snowden documents published by The Intercept and Der Spiegel in 2014.</p>
<p>âFor both TLS and IPsec, there are both secure and insecure ways of configuring these protocols, so they can&#8217;t really be labeled as blanket âsecureâ or âinsecure,ââ Heninger explained. âBoth protocols offer a zillion configurable options, which is a source of a lot of the published protocol-level vulnerabilities, and there are cipher suites and parameter choices for both protocols that are definitely known to be cryptographically vulnerable.â Still, she was âpretty confidentâ that there are ways to configure TLS and IPsec that âshould resist all known attacks.â</p>

<p>Another possibility is that the NSA figured out how to break the encryption on VPNs without even using cryptography. âI should also note that we&#8217;ve seen a lot of hardcoded credentials and other software vulnerabilities get found in various VPN implementations, which would enable a bunch of boring noncryptographic attacks like just running a script on an end host to exfiltrate login credentials or other data as desired. This is the kind of thing that most of the Shadow Brokers tools were actually doing,â Heninger said, referring to the cache of post-Snowden <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/06/leaked-files-show-how-nsa-tracks-other-countries-hackers/">NSA exploits and hacking tools</a> that were published on the internet in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>In 2015, Heninger and a team of 13 other cryptographers <a href="https://weakdh.org/">published</a> a paper, titled &#8220;Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice,&#8221; that revealed major weaknesses in the security of several of the internetâs most popular protocols. Their paper described a new attack called Logjam and concluded that it was within the resources of a nation-state to use this attack to compromise 66 percent of all IPSec VPNs. âA close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agencyâs attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break,â the authors speculated.</p>
<p>The NSA declined to comment for this story.</p>

This allows an organizationâs staff to access internal services like file-sharing servers or private wikis without having to physically be in the office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The NSA&#8217;s ability to crack into sensitive VPNs belonging to large organizations, all the way back in 2006, raises broader questions about the security of such networks. Many consumers pay for access to VPNs in order toÂ mask the origin of their internet traffic from the sites they visit, hide their surfing habits from their internet service providers, and to protect against eavesdroppers on public Wi-Fi networks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The fact that the NSA spied on Al Jazeeraâs communications was \u003ca href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nsa-spied-on-al-jazeera-communications-snowden-document-a-919681.html\">reported by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel\u003c/a> in 2013, but that reporting did not mention that the spying was accomplished through the NSAâs compromise of Al Jazeeraâs VPN. During the Bush administration, high-ranking U.S. officials \u003ca href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php\">criticized\u003c/a> Al Jazeera, accusing the Qatar-based news organization of having an anti-American bias, including because it broadcasted taped messages from Osama bin Laden.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>&#8220;Both protocols offer a zillion configurable options, which is a source of a lot of the vulnerabilities.&#8221;\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>At the time, Al Jazeera defended itself against this criticism, insisting that its reporting was objective. &#8220;Osama bin Laden, like it or not, is a party to this present crisis,&#8221; news editor Ahmed Al Sheikh \u003ca href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1591361.stm\">told\u003c/a> the BBC \u003ca href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1591361.stm\">in 2001\u003c/a>. &#8220;If we said that we were not going to allow him the air time, then we would have lost our integrity and objectivity and our coverage of the story would have become unbalanced.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to the document, contained in the cache of materials provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the NSA also compromised VPNs used by airline reservation systems Iran Air, âParaguayan SABRE,â Russian airline Aeroflot, and âRussian Galileo.â Sabre and Galileo are both privately operated, centralized computer systems that facilitate travel transactions like booking airline tickets. Collectively, they are used by hundreds of airlines around the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In Iraq, the NSA compromised VPNs at the Ministries of Defense and the Interior; the Ministry of Defense had been established by the U.S. in 2004 after the prior iteration was dissolved. Exploitation against the ministriesâ VPNs appears to have occurred at roughly the same time as a broader âall-out campaign to penetrate Iraqi networks,â \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/13/sloppy-u-s-spies-misused-covert-network-for-personal-shopping-and-other-stories-from-internal-nsa-documents/#spying-on-iraq\">described by an NSA staffer\u003c/a> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/13/sloppy-u-s-spies-misused-covert-network-for-personal-shopping-and-other-stories-from-internal-nsa-documents/#spying-on-iraq\">in 2005\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>âAlthough VPNs pose special challenges for SIGINT (signals intelligence) collection and processing, weâve recently had notable success in exploiting these communications,â wrote the author of the document, an article for the internal NSA news site SIDtoday. The author added that the NSAâs Network Analysis Center had been focusing on âVPN SIGINT Development (SIGDev) for over three years now, and the investment is paying off!â The article does not say what VPN technology any of the targets used, nor does it give any technical details on how the NSA broke the encryption on them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The technical details that describe how the NSA exploits VPNs are a closely-guarded secret, according to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2018/08/15/nsa-sidtoday-giving-answers-keeping-secrets\">another SIDtoday article,\u003c/a> from December 2006. âExploiting VPNs makes use of some of the newest state-of-the-art techniques,â the article stated, âand because of this, the exploitation details are held closely and generally not available to field sites.â The author went on to describe a tool called VIVIDDREAM that lets analysts who discover new VPNs test whether the NSA has the capability to exploit it, all without revealing to the analyst any sensitive information about how the exploit works.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Documents provided to news organizations by Snowden do not conclusively list which VPN technologies have been compromised by the NSA and which have not. However, there have been a number of news reports about the NSAâs VPN hacking capabilities based on these documents, and cryptographers who have reviewed them have come up with some educated guesses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2014, The Intercept \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/\">reported\u003c/a> on the NSAâs plans, dated August 2009, to use an automated system called TURBINE to covertly infect millions of computers with malware. The revelations described a piece of NSA malware called HAMMERSTEIN, installed on routers that VPN traffic traverses. The malware was able to forward VPN traffic that uses the IPSec protocol back to the NSA to decrypt. However, the documents did not explain precisely how the decryption occurred.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Later that year, Der Spiegel \u003ca href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/inside-the-nsa-s-war-on-internet-security-a-1010361.html\">published 17 documents\u003c/a> from the Snowden archive related to the NSAâs attacks against VPNs, many of them providing more details about TURBINE, HAMMERSTEIN, and related programs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are many different VPN protocols in use, some of them \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/211329/which-is-the-best-vpn-protocol-pptp-vs.-openvpn-vs.-l2tpipsec-vs.-sstp/\">known\u003c/a> to be less secure than others, and each can be configured in ways to make them more or less secure. One, Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, âis old and insecure and there are a bunch of known security vulnerabilities since forever,â Nadia Heninger, cryptography researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, told me in an email. âI would not at all be shocked if these were being exploited in the wild.â\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The NSA also appears to have, at least in some situations, broken the security of another VPN protocol, Internet Protocol Security, or IPSec, according to the Snowden documents published by The Intercept and Der Spiegel in 2014.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>âFor both TLS and IPsec, there are both secure and insecure ways of configuring these protocols, so they can&#8217;t really be labeled as blanket âsecureâ or âinsecure,ââ Heninger explained. âBoth protocols offer a zillion configurable options, which is a source of a lot of the published protocol-level vulnerabilities, and there are cipher suites and parameter choices for both protocols that are definitely known to be cryptographically vulnerable.â Still, she was âpretty confidentâ that there are ways to configure TLS and IPsec that âshould resist all known attacks.â\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\">\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>Another possibility is that the NSA figured out how to break the encryption on VPNs without even using cryptography. âI should also note that we&#8217;ve seen a lot of hardcoded credentials and other software vulnerabilities get found in various VPN implementations, which would enable a bunch of boring noncryptographic attacks like just running a script on an end host to exfiltrate login credentials or other data as desired. This is the kind of thing that most of the Shadow Brokers tools were actually doing,â Heninger said, referring to the cache of post-Snowden \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/03/06/leaked-files-show-how-nsa-tracks-other-countries-hackers/\">NSA exploits and hacking tools\u003c/a> that were published on the internet in 2016 and 2017.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2015, Heninger and a team of 13 other cryptographers \u003ca href=\"https://weakdh.org/\">published\u003c/a> a paper, titled &#8220;Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice,&#8221; that revealed major weaknesses in the security of several of the internetâs most popular protocols. Their paper described a new attack called Logjam and concluded that it was within the resources of a nation-state to use this attack to compromise 66 percent of all IPSec VPNs. âA close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agencyâs attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break,â the authors speculated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The NSA declined to comment for this story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: A Qatari employee of Al Jazeera Arabic language TV news channel walks past the logo of Al Jazeera in Doha, Qatar in Nov. 1, 2006.\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2018-08-15T18:09:34+00:00","date_local":"2018-08-15T14:09:34+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"The agency broke into virtual private networks for several key targets, including two government entities in Iraq.","excerpt_type":"default","feature_header_background_color":"","feature_header_color":"","feature_header_layout":"default","feature_image_mask":"normal","feature_interactive_url":"","feature_text_color":"","feature_title":"Featured News","featured_video_url":"","hide_featured_image":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"is_feature":"0","language":{"code":"en","name":"English","slug":"english"},"language_related_post_ids":"205286","language_related_post_permalinks":["https://theintercept.com/2018/08/15/nsa-vpns-aljazeera-iraque/"],"language_related_posts":[{"date":"2018-08-15T21:24:05+00:00","language":{"code":"pt","name":"Portuguese","slug":"portuguese"},"url":"https://theintercept.com/2018/08/15/nsa-vpns-aljazeera-iraque/"}],"layout":"default","link":"https://theintercept.com/2018/08/15/nsa-vpn-hack-al-jazeera-sidtoday/","meta":{"links":[]},"mobile_thumbnail":null,"page_share_twitter_text":"","partner_feeds":[{"name":"Medium","slug":"medium"},{"name":"Smart News","slug":"smart-news"},{"name":"Spoken Layer","slug":"spoken-layer"},{"name":"Uproxx","slug":"uproxx"}],"partnership":{"article_logo":"","article_logo_blurb":"In partnership with","article_text_color":"#AAAAAA","homepage_background_color":"#EEEEEE","homepage_featured":"0","homepage_logo":"","homepage_logo_blurb":"In partnership with","homepage_text_color":"#111111","module_type":"default","partner":"default","partner_url":"","video_module_post_description":"","video_module_post_image":"","video_module_post_title":""},"post_status":"publish","post_type":"post","prefer_talk_comments":true,"promo_image":{"ID":204637,"alt_text":"FILE -- In this Nov. 1, 2006 file photo, a Qatari employee of Al Jazeera Arabic language TV news channel walks past the logo of Al Jazeera in Doha, Qatar.
