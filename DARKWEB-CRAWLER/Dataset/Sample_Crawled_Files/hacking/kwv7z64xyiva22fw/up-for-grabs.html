<p>
 This is a list of projects which have curated tasks
 specifically for new contributors. These are a great
 way to get started with a project, or to help share
 the load of working on open source projects.
</p>

<p>
 Find a project you'd like to get involved with:

  <ul>
    <li>Read the contributor guidelines for the project</li>
    <li>Get the project running locally</li>
    <li>Leave a message on a task you'd like to work on</li>
    <li>Get to work!</li>
  </ul>
</p>

</div>
<div class="block">
  <h1><span class="header-inside">Projects</span></h1>
  <div id="projects-panel">
  </div>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <h1><span class="header-inside">I maintain a project!</span></h1>

<p>
  We're looking for projects who can take the time out to
  help mentor developers as they get started with
  open source.
</p>

<p>
  What sort of tasks are a good fit?

<ul>
  <li>Tasks should take no longer than a few nights' worth of work</li>
  <li>Tasks should stand alone - avoid core functionality on which other tasks depend</li>
  <li>Tasks should be well described with pointers to help the implementer</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  We suggest the label <code>up-for-grabs</code>
  but using a different name is also acceptable.
</p>

<p>
  If this sounds like you, getting involved is simple:

<ol>
 <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-labels-for-issues-and-pull-requests/" title="Creating and editing labels for issues and pull requests">Label</a> bugs and feature requests that would be a good place to start</li>
 <li>Grab the URL to this list of tasks so that others can get to it easily</li>
 <li><a href="https://github.com/login">Sign in to GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/up-for-grabs/up-for-grabs.net#add-a-project">check out the README.</a></li>
