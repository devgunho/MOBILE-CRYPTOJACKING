data-reactid="227"></div><div class="content drop-cap" data-reactid="228"><p data-reactid="229">Two days after <strong>Donald Trump&#x2019;s</strong> election, Jamal Khashoggi returned to the Red Sea port city of Jeddah from Washington where he&#x2019;d given a foreign-policy talk lightly critical of then president-elect Trump, when he received a phone call from the media adviser to the kingdom&#x2019;s ascendent deputy Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> better known by his initials M.B.S. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re not allowed to tweet or write your column or give comments to foreign journalists,&#x2019;&#x201D; Khashoggi recalled to me in March 2018. &#x201C;I was ordered silent.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="230">As a member of the Saudi elite for decades, Khashoggi understood that political expression had strict limits in the kingdom, but M.B.S.&#x2019;s apparent determination to quell even mild dissent on foreign soil left Khashoggi unnerved. Ten months later, in September 2017, he fled to Washington. &#x201C;I began to feel whatever narrow space I had in Saudi Arabia was getting narrower. I thought it would be better to get out and be safe,&#x201D; he told me.</p><!-- react-empty: 231 --><!-- react-empty: 232 --><!-- react-empty: 233 --><p data-reactid="234">I initially contacted Khashoggi for a prospective article about the young prince&#x2019;s relationship to the White House, which I shelved because he was one of the few people who would speak openly. When he left Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi told me, he didn&#x2019;t see himself in the mold of a dissident. He&#x2019;d been editor-in-chief of the Saudi newspaper <em>Al Watan</em> and a media adviser to Prince <strong>Turki al-Faisal,</strong> Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s ambassador to Britain. Moreover, he wanted M.B.S. to succeed. &#x201C;He truly wants to make Saudi Arabia great again. But he is doing it the wrong way,&#x201D;  Khashoggi told me.</p><p data-reactid="235">But a month after his departure from the kingdom, Khashoggi&#x2019;s view of M.B.S. fundamentally changed. Saudi security services arrested scores of prominent businessmen and imprisoned them inside the Ritz-Carlton under the guise of an &#x201C;anti-corruption&#x201D; crackdown. Khashoggi soon began hearing from friends in Saudi Arabia that prisoners were coerced, in some cases tortured, into turning over billions of dollars to the government. &#x201C;It was tough. Some were insulted. Some were hit. Some claim they were electrocuted,&#x201D; he said. The purge, which also included intellectuals, media personalities, and moderate clerics, convinced Khashoggi that M.B.S. had sold himself as a reformer when in fact he was a brutal authoritarian. &#x201C;When the arrests started happening, I flipped. I decided it was time to speak,&#x201D; he told me.</p><p data-reactid="236">Khashoggi subsequently landed a column in <em>The Washington Post</em> where he wrote critically about M.B.S.&#x2019;s internal power grab; his reckless military intervention in neighboring Yemen, where he has created a humanitarian emergency; and the prince&#x2019;s bizarre plot to kidnap Lebanese prime minister <strong>Saad Hariri.</strong> &#x201C;Saudi Arabia wasn&#x2019;t a free society, but people weren&#x2019;t being arrested like this,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The people M.B.S. arrested were not radicals. The majority were reformers for women&#x2019;s rights and open society. He arrested them to spread fear. He is replacing religious intolerance with political closure.&#x201D; An adviser to one prominent Saudi businessman who was arrested told me: &#x201C;People are scared. It has become a bit of a police state.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="237">Tragically, Khashoggi&#x2019;s self-imposed exile didn&#x2019;t keep him safe. Earlier this month, Khashoggi entered Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents he needed for his upcoming wedding and never emerged. Turkish officials have told Western journalists that a kill team of 15 Saudi agents detained Khashoggi inside the consulate, tortured him to death, and dismembered his body with a bone saw. M.B.S. and his father, <strong>King Salman,</strong> have denied their involvement in Khashoggi&#x2019;s disappearance, but already the grisly episode has damaged M.B.S.&#x2019;s ambitions to cultivate global elites. A parade of C.E.O.s including Uber&#x2019;s <strong>Dara Khosrowshahi,</strong> JPMorgan Chase&#x2019;s <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/jamie-dimon#intcid=dt-hot-link">Jamie Dimon</a>,</strong> and BlackRock&#x2019;s <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/larry-fink#intcid=dt-hot-link">Larry Fink</a></strong> have canceled plans to attend an investment conference hosted by M.B.S. next week at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton dubbed &#x201C;Davos in the Desert,&#x201D; though Fink, at least, has said he&#x2019;ll maintain his business ties to the kingdom.</p><p data-reactid="238">Khashoggi and I spoke last March during M.B.S.&#x2019;s three-week tour of the United States that was designed to cement M.B.S.&#x2019;s image on the global stage as an avatar of a modern Middle East. In the <em>Times,</em> <strong>Tom Friedman</strong> wrote a column gushing that M.B.S. possessed a &#x201C;fire hose of new ideas about transforming his country . . . who talks the language of tech, and whose biggest sin may be that he wants to go too fast.&#x201D; One media C.E.O. who met with the prince on his visit praised the prince&#x2019;s plans to allow women to drive and movie theaters to open. M.B.S. was feted by the Trump administration, <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/prince-mohammed-does-hollywood">Rupert Murdoch</a>, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/prince-mohammed-does-hollywood">Jeff Bezos</a>,</strong> and even <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/middleeast/saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-us.html">Oprah</a>.</strong></p><p data-reactid="239">The elite&#x2019;s embrace of M.B.S. had been one of the chief foreign-policy goals of the Trump White House, particularly <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/jared-kushner#intcid=dt-hot-link">Jared Kushner</a>.</strong> Saudi Arabia was crucial to Kushner&#x2019;s yet-to-be-released Middle East peace plan that involved building a Sunni-Israeli alliance to broker peace with the Palestinians and counter an expansionist Iran. &#x201C;Jared had a vision from the very beginning,&#x201D; a former West Wing official said. Kushner&#x2019;s support for M.B.S. at times bordered on blind faith. In November 2017, the <em>Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/the-saudi-crown-princes-risky-power-play/2017/11/05/4b12fcf0-c272-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.ace9d3ac8edd">reported</a> that Kushner made an unannounced trip to Riyadh just days before the Ritz arrests began and stayed up several nights discussing strategy with M.B.S. &#x2019;til 4 A.M. (The White House declined to comment.)</p><p data-reactid="240">Kushner&#x2019;s bromance with M.B.S. generated criticism from Trump&#x2019;s national security team, especially former Secretary of State <strong>Rex Tillerson.</strong> &#x201C;Tillerson said, &#x2018;The kid&#x2019;s a rookie, he doesn&#x2019;t know the region.&#x2019; He was beyond dismissive,&#x201D; a former West Wing official said. Another former West Wing official recalled: &#x201C;There were many confrontations between Tillerson and Jared where Tillerson was emotionally angry that Jared was in contact with M.B.S. I remember in a couple of instances, Tillerson would confront Jared about directly talking to M.B.S. Rex felt out of loop.&#x201D; (Tillerson did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p data-reactid="241">Diplomats who served in the region also question Kushner&#x2019;s logic of investing so much in an untested and impulsive young royal. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve taken to calling M.B.S. a progressive authoritarian. He&#x2019;s using this anti-corruption push toward cleaning up but also removing rivals,&#x201D; said <strong>Robert Jordan,</strong> who served as <strong>George W. Bush&#x2019;s</strong> ambassador to Saudi Arabia after 9/11.</p><p data-reactid="242">Yesterday, Secretary of State <strong>Mike Pompeo</strong> flew to Riyadh to diffuse the global crisis over Khashoggi&#x2019;s death&#x2014;a State Department spokesperson said in a statement that he &#x201C;conveyed the importance of conducting a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation&#x201D; in meetings with both M.B.S. and King Salman. As of now, Treasury Secretary <strong>Steven Mnuchin</strong> still plans to attend the conference at the Ritz.</p><div class="mvt-variant" style="min-width:1px;min-height:1px;"

days after <strong>Donald Trump&#x2019;s</strong> election, Jamal Khashoggi returned to the Red Sea port city of Jeddah from Washington where he&#x2019;d given a foreign-policy talk lightly critical of then president-elect Trump, when he received a phone call from the media adviser to the kingdom&#x2019;s ascendent deputy Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> better known by his initials M.B.S. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re not allowed to tweet or write your column or give comments to foreign journalists,&#x2019;&#x201D; Khashoggi recalled to me in March 2018. &#x201C;I was ordered silent.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>As a member of the Saudi elite for decades, Khashoggi understood that political expression had strict limits in the kingdom, but M.B.S.&#x2019;s apparent determination to quell even mild dissent on foreign soil left Khashoggi unnerved. Ten months later, in September 2017, he fled to Washington. &#x201C;I began to feel whatever narrow space I had in Saudi Arabia was getting narrower. I thought it would be better to get out and be safe,&#x201D; he told me.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>I initially contacted Khashoggi for a prospective article about the young prince&#x2019;s relationship to the White House, which I shelved because he was one of the few people who would speak openly. When he left Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi told me, he didn&#x2019;t see himself in the mold of a dissident. He&#x2019;d been editor-in-chief of the Saudi newspaper <em>Al Watan</em> and a media adviser to Prince <strong>Turki al-Faisal,</strong> Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s ambassador to Britain. Moreover, he wanted M.B.S. to succeed. &#x201C;He truly wants to make Saudi Arabia great again. But he is doing it the wrong way,&#x201D;  Khashoggi told me.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>But a month after his departure from the kingdom, Khashoggi&#x2019;s view of M.B.S. fundamentally changed. Saudi security services arrested scores of prominent businessmen and imprisoned them inside the Ritz-Carlton under the guise of an &#x201C;anti-corruption&#x201D; crackdown. Khashoggi soon began hearing from friends in Saudi Arabia that prisoners were coerced, in some cases tortured, into turning over billions of dollars to the government. &#x201C;It was tough. Some were insulted. Some were hit. Some claim they were electrocuted,&#x201D; he said. The purge, which also included intellectuals, media personalities, and moderate clerics, convinced Khashoggi that M.B.S. had sold himself as a reformer when in fact he was a brutal authoritarian. &#x201C;When the arrests started happening, I flipped. I decided it was time to speak,&#x201D; he told me.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Khashoggi subsequently landed a column in <em>The Washington Post</em> where he wrote critically about M.B.S.&#x2019;s internal power grab; his reckless military intervention in neighboring Yemen, where he has created a humanitarian emergency; and the prince&#x2019;s bizarre plot to kidnap Lebanese prime minister <strong>Saad Hariri.</strong> &#x201C;Saudi Arabia wasn&#x2019;t a free society, but people weren&#x2019;t being arrested like this,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The people M.B.S. arrested were not radicals. The majority were reformers for women&#x2019;s rights and open society. He arrested them to spread fear. He is replacing religious intolerance with political closure.&#x201D; An adviser to one prominent Saudi businessman who was arrested told me: &#x201C;People are scared. It has become a bit of a police state.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Tragically, Khashoggi&#x2019;s self-imposed exile didn&#x2019;t keep him safe. Earlier this month, Khashoggi entered Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents he needed for his upcoming wedding and never emerged. Turkish officials have told Western journalists that a kill team of 15 Saudi agents detained Khashoggi inside the consulate, tortured him to death, and dismembered his body with a bone saw. M.B.S. and his father, <strong>King Salman,</strong> have denied their involvement in Khashoggi&#x2019;s disappearance, but already the grisly episode has damaged M.B.S.&#x2019;s ambitions to cultivate global elites.

And thatâs causing concern not only in the embassy but also among members of Congress. . . . When a member of the administration travels to another country, the embassy often helps coordinate the trip and provides some kind of security. This time, though, the Saudi government provided security for Kushner and his entourage, sources said. And the embassy was largely left in the dark on the details of Kushnerâs schedule and his conversations with Saudi officials, according to two individuals with knowledge of the trip to the country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lack of insight into Kushnerâs visit to Saudi Arabia has frustrated members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, who told the Daily Beast that they are actively trying to learn more about the conversations between senior U.S. administration officials and Saudi Arabia. Lawmakers said they were concerned that the embassy in Riyadh did not have knowledge of what was discussed between Kushner, <strong>M.B.S.,</strong> and <strong>King Salman,</strong> pointing to the increasingly fragile relationship between the two countries following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What could the two have discussed that Kushner didnât want to get out? The list is endless, but may have included: the bum rap M.B.S. got over that whole dismemberment by bone saw; the plan put in place by disgraced former national security adviser and <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/ivanka-trump-helping-choose-next-world-bank-president\">hire</a> <strong>Mike Flynn</strong> to sell Saudi Arabia technology that could â<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/flynn-backed-plan-transfer-nuclear-tech-saudis-may-have-broken-n973021\">contribute to the proliferation of nuclear arms throughout an already unstable Middle East</a>â; or simply how itâs been too long since the two men, who have been <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-jared-kushner-robert-mueller\">bro-ing out</a> since early in Trumpâs tenure, have gotten to hang out I.R.L. The White House, through an anonymous official, claimed the Daily Beastâs report of the meeting âis not trueâ and that âthe sources are misinformed.â</p>\n<p>The president, who also has a

<strong>Jared Kushner</strong> bought a Midtown tower with the inauspicious address of 666 Fifth Avenue for what was then a record-setting $1.8 billion, putting down just $50 million and borrowing the rest. At the time, Kushner was helping out with the family business in the aftermath of his fatherâs conviction for tax evasion, witness tampering, and illegal campaign contributions, and was eager to make his mark in the industry. And oh, how he did! Kushner Companies was unable to get the office rents they expected, the building was perpetually 30 percent vacant, and even its partners <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-kushners-china-deal-flop-was-part-of-much-bigger-hunt-for-cash/\">were saying</a> things like â[666] would be worth a lot more if it was just dirt.â As the February 2019 due date for a $1.4 billion mortgage <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/nyregion/kushner-companies-666-fifth-avenue.html\">approached</a>, the Kushners crisscrossed the globe attempting find partners for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/kushner-may-soon-be-working-at-tgi-fridays\">a Hail Mary plan</a> to raze the property and replace it with a new tower&#8212;one that wouldâve required even more money, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-kushners-china-deal-flop-was-part-of-much-bigger-hunt-for-cash/\">including a $4 billion construction loan</a>&#8212;to no avail. (The family was reportedly rebuffed by everyone from the richest man in France to the South Koreaâs sovereign-wealth fund.) And then, as if by magic, Brookfield Asset Management <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/kushner-family-close-to-deal-to-unload-666-fifth-avenue-1533322813\">purchased</a> a 99-year lease on the building, giving the Kushners enough to pay off their debt and buy out Vornado Realty Trust, which owned the retail part of the property. And even though Brookfield has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/qatar-666-5th-ave-jared-kushner\">insisted</a> that its second-largest investor, the Qatar Investment Authority, knew nothing about the deal to bail out the the presidentâs son-in-law and senior adviser, some obstructionist Democrats donât seem to be buying it!</p>\n<p>Axios <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/house-democrats-kushner-companies-666-fifth-avenue-19865df3-7fc4-434c-a62e-4bc7a5e3dea3.html\">reports</a> that House Dems <strong>Maxine Waters,</strong> <strong>Elijah Cummings,</strong> and <strong>Ted Lieu</strong> are âdiscussing investigating the cash infusion the Kushner Companiesâ flagship New York office tower received in summer 2018.â Lieu, who sits on the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees, told reporter <strong>Alayna Treene</strong> that he finds the deal âreally troubling.â According to Cummings, his team has been âlooking at that for a while.â</p>\n<p>If the House has been concerned about the details of the 666 bailout for some time, those concerns were presumably turbo-charged last week when <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/jared-kushner-security-clearance\">reported</a> that Kushner only received top-secret security clearance because <strong>Donald Trump</strong> demanded it over the objections of intelligence officials, his chief of staff, and the then-White House counsel, all of whom were reportedly worried about the Boy Prince of New Jerseyâs âforeign and business contacts.â Kushner did little to dispel the notion that heâd sell state secrets to the highest bidder to finance some condos in Jersey City by <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/jared-kushner-saudi-arabia-mbs-meeting\">refusing</a> to allow embassy staffers to sit in on his meeting last week with Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> who U.S. officials fear views Kushner as a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/8/18132042/jared-kushner-mohammed-bin-salman-nyt-report\">ripe target for manipulation</a>. And speaking of the Saudis:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At around the same time [as the 666 bailout], Brookfieldâs acquisition of Westinghouse Electric, a nuclear power company, was finalized. This connection became problematic after the House Oversight Committee released a report last month alleging some members of the Trump administration proposed selling nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia over the objections of top national security officials. The report noted that Westinghouse, which manufactures power plants, could benefit from such a deal. The White House did not respond to Axiosâs request for comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>White House economic adviser: we are f--king China so hard</strong></p>\n<p>âWe have them over a barrel,â <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/08/larry-kudlow-signals-possible-trump-xi-mar-a-lago-summit-soon.html\">told</a> CNBC Friday of the impact of Trumpâs tariffs on the Chinese economy, not mentioning that said tariffs cost Americans <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/trumps-trade-war-cost-americans-dollar3-billion-a-month-last-year\">$3 billion a month last year</a>. Still, Kudlow doesnât want to sound like heâs taking total glee in knocking Chinaâs economy down a peg (which, by the by, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trumps-top-economic-guru-we-are-screwed\">has also had a negative impact on U.S. companies</a>). âWe would like [to get] a good deal,â he added. âBoth countries should benefit.â</p>\n<p><strong>Martin Shkreli is under investigation again</strong></p>\n<p>That tends to happen when it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/martin-shkreli-is-running-his-business-from-prison\">emerges</a> that youâve reportedly been running the company youâre legally barred from running via a contraband cell phone. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bureau-of-prisons-opens-new-investigation-into-martin-shkreli-11552069443\">Per the <em>W.S.J.</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. Bureau of Prisons opened an investigation into pharmaceutical wunderkind Martin Shkreliâs behavior behind bars, a bureau spokesperson said Friday. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported Thursday that Mr. Shkreli, 35 years old, is largely running his former drug company, Phoenixus AG, from his prison cell in Fort Dix, N.J., via a contraband smartphone. Mr. Shkreli is 16 months into a seven-year sentence for securities fraud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a statement, the prisons bureau spokesperson told the <em>Journal,</em> âWhen there are allegations of misconduct, they are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is taken if such allegations are proven true. This allegation is currently under investigation.â</p>\n<p><strong>Do a lot of inaugural campaigns receive donations from shell companies tied to foreign nationals?</strong></p>\n<p>Just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/08/trump-inauguration-money-shell-companies-revealed\">asking for a friend</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Donald Trumpâs inauguration received tens of thousands of dollars from shell companies that masked the involvement of a foreign contributor or others with foreign ties. <em>The Guardian</em> has identified the creators of three obscure firms that contributed money to Trumpâs inaugural committee, which collected a record $107 million as he entered the White House in 2017. The three companies each gave $25,000 to Trumpâs inaugural fund. At least one of the contributions was made for a foreign national who appears ineligible to make political donations in the U.S.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the $25,000 donations to Trumpâs inauguration was made through a Delaware shell company for a wealthy Indian financier based in London, who appears to not hold U.S. citizenship or residency. Another was made by a company formed in Georgia by a lobbyist with connections to the Taiwanese government. His wife said the firm was funded by Chinese investors.

there is no other way.","body":"<p>Earlier this week, <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/ivanka-trump-jobs-guarantee\">explained</a> that a federal jobs guarantee was a terrible idea that no one should support because âAmericans, in their heart, [donât] want to be given something. . . . People want to work for what they get.â This struck many as something of a curious philosophy, given the circumstances under which both the First Daughter and her husband earned their jobs in the White House (having them handed to them, despite their egregious lack of qualifications), in addition to everything else in their lives. And on Thursday, a new report suggested that Ivanka and Jared may not subscribe to the âno handoutsâ policy, for themselves, at all!</p>\n<p><em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance.html\">reports</a> that the only reason <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> was granted the highest level of security clearance last May was because his father-in-law, <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> demanded it&#8212;over the objections of intelligence officials, the White Houseâs top lawyer, and the chief of staff at the time. Prior to May, Kushner had been assigned clearance on an âinterim top-secretâ basis, which was downgraded to âsecretâ in February 2018, and which limited his access to classified information. And for good reason!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[T]he clearance had been held up in part over questions from the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. about his foreign and business contacts, including those related to Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia, according to multiple people familiar with the events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Kushner was part of a group that met with a Russian lawyer who went to Trump Tower claiming to have political âdirtâ on <strong>Hillary Clinton.</strong> And during the presidential transition, Mr. Kushner had a meeting with the Russian ambassador at the time, <strong>Sergey I. Kislyak,</strong> and the head of a Russian state-owned bank. When he applied for a security clearance, he did not reveal those meetings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the holdup did not sit well with either Kushner or Ivanka (who had also been operating on a temporary clearance), creating a situation that the couple presumably dealt with in a professional and reasonable fashion, i.e., by stomping their feet and yelling, âDADDY, WE WANT OUR TOP-SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCE, AND WE WANT IT NOW!â</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump both complained to the president about the situation, current and former administration officials said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Mr. Kushnerâs case, Mr. Trump would often turn to other aides and say in frustration, âWhy isnât this getting done?â according to a former administration official. On at least one occasion, the president asked another senior official if the person could sort out the issue. That official said no, according to this account.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like Kushner and Ivanka, though, Donald Trump is unfamiliar with the concept of âno,â and wasnât about to educate himself, even if it meant risking the security of the country. His <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-jared-kushner-robert-mueller\">extremely easily manipulated</a> son-in-law was going to get his top-secret clearance, and he was going to get it <em>now,</em> goddamnit!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Trumpâs decision in May so troubled senior administration officials that at least one, the White House chief of staff at the time, <strong>John F. Kelly,</strong> wrote a contemporaneous internal memo about how he had been âorderedâ to give Mr. Kushner the top-secret clearance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The White House counsel at the time, <strong>Donald F. McGahn II,</strong> also wrote an internal memo outlining the concerns that had been raised about Mr. Kushner&#8212;including by the C.I.A.&#8212;and how Mr. McGahn had recommended that he not be given a top-secret clearance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be clear, the normal process for granting someone a security clearance involves the White Houseâs personnel security office making a determination after an F.B.I. background check. If there is a dispute about how to move forward&#8212;something that rarely happens&#8212;the White House counsel makes the call, which, in this case, was overruled by the president, another highly unusual occurrence. Also highly unusual? For the president, his daughter, and his son-in-lawâs lawyer to insist everything was done by the book when that clearly wasnât the case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The disclosure of the memos contradicts statements made by the president, who told <em>The New York Times</em> in January in an Oval Office interview that he had no role in his son-in-law receiving his clearance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Kushnerâs lawyer, <strong>Abbe D. Lowell,</strong> also said that at the time the clearance was granted last year that his client went through a standard process. Ivanka Trump, the presidentâs eldest daughter and Mr. Kushnerâs wife, said the same thing three weeks ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Ivankaâs <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/us/politics/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-security-clearance.html\">exact words</a>: âThere were anonymous leaks about there being issues. But the president had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husbandâs clearance, zero.â)</p>\n<p>In a statement on Thursday, White House spokesperson <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> said, âWe donât comment on security clearances.â <strong>Peter Mirijanian,</strong> a spokesman for Kushnerâs lawyer, offered the bizarre explanation that new revelations donât change the original statements, even if said revelations suggest the original statements were lies. (âIn 2018, White House and security-clearance officials affirmed that Mr. Kushnerâs security clearance was handled in the regular process with no pressure from anyone,â Mirijanian said. âThat was conveyed to the media at the time, and new stories, if accurate, do not change what was affirmed at the time.â)</p>\n<p>Democrats have already announced that their committees will be looking into the curious case of Kushnerâs clearance, with Representative <strong>Adam Schiff</strong> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/432144-dems-slam-trump-for-nepotism-on-kushners-security-clearance\">saying</a> in a statement that the allegations are âthe latest indicator of the presidentâs utter disregard for our national security and for the men and women who sacrifice so much every day to keep us safe.â In related news, earlier this week, Kushner was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/world/middleeast/kushner-Mohammed-bin-Salman.html\">reunited</a> with Saudi Crown\nPrince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong> for the first time since the kingdom murdered a U.S. resident via bone saw, and news <a

Youâve just landed a job in the White House that the haters say you in no way deserve, one because of your utter lack of qualifications, and two because of a sense that youâre only in it to enrich yourself. How do you prove them wrong? If youâre <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> and <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> the answer, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/will-trump-appoint-special-prosecutor-to-investigate-ivanka-trump-emails\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/mike-pompeo-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia\">course</a>, is to conduct official business over private e-mail and messaging platforms like WhatsApp, including reported correspondence with dictators the C.I.A. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html\">says</a> ordered the assassination of a U.S. resident. Then, to really show âem, you refuse to comply with government requests for information re: your conduct, which, as a reminder, is the same conduct President Daddy said made <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> a criminal. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/cummings-gives-white-house-last-chance-comply-request-email-use-n985966\">Per NBC News</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>House Oversight Committee Chair <strong>Elijah Cummings</strong> is giving the White House a final chance to âvoluntarilyâ comply with his investigation into the use of private email accounts by Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and other White House officials before resorting to âalternative meansâ to obtain the information. In a letter sent Thursday to White House counsel <strong>Pat Cipollone,</strong> Cummings accused the White House of âobstructingâ his committeeâs work and called the officialsâ practices a potential violation of federal records laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Among the committeeâs concerns, according to Cummingsâ letter, is an admission by Kushnerâs attorney, <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> that Kushner âhas been using the messaging application WhatsApp as part of his official White House duties to communicate with foreign leaders.â Itâs unclear whether the communications may have contained classified information. In the letter, Cummings asks that Cipollone indicate by March 28 whether the White House will comply voluntarily.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jared and Ivanka, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/jared-kushner-security-clearance\">you may recall</a>, only received top-secret security clearance last summer because Trump overrode the concerns of the F.B.I., his then-chief of staff, and the then-White House counsel. Among the concerns over Kushner gaining access to top-secret information were questions about his âforeign and business contacts,â which intelligence officials worried made him a target ripe for manipulation. So itâs definitely not at all concerning that heâs reportedly been chatting with foreign governments&#8212;some of whom have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-jared-kushner-robert-mueller\">bragged</a> about having Kushner in their âpocketâ&#8212;on the D.L. (In response to Cummingsâs letter, Lowell disputed the congressmanâs recollection of their conversation, saying heâd told lawmakers, âIf there was a question about Jaredâs use of WhatsApp, that is a question for White House counsel, not me.â Lowell also claimed that when he said Ivanka continued to use private e-mail to conduct official business, he was talking about the period before September 2017.)</p>\n<p>Outside of Javankaâs electronic communications, other areas of concern for Cummings include former deputy national security advisor <strong>K.T. McFarland</strong> using a private e-mail account to discuss selling nukes to Saudi Arabia, an idea that <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/flynn-backed-plan-transfer-nuclear-tech-saudis-may-have-broken-n973021\">reportedly came from</a> from her disgraced ex-boss, <strong>Mike Flynn:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cummings also told Cipollone that the committee obtained a document showing that McFarland was using an AOL.com account to conduct official White House business. Cummings said the document shows that McFarland was in communication with <strong>Tom Barrack,</strong> a longtime Trump confidant and the chairman of the presidentâs Inaugural Committee, about transferring âsensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The White House acknowledged receiving Cummings&#39; letter but had no immediate response.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cummings has requested the relevant documents be handed over to his committee no later than April 4. Weâre sure the First Daughter and Son-in-Law have told West Wing staff to give the Congressman everything he needs.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Area man tries out new set at open mic night</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/learyreports/status/1108821147775307777\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/learyreports/status/1108821147775307777\">https://twitter.com/learyreports/status/1108821147775307777</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Wall Street donors not yet ready to board the Biden Express</strong></p>\n<p>âI told him, âI can donate but I donât think I can raise you money today.â The sense weâre getting [from other donors] is yes, heâs a good guy and everybody knows him, but he has run for president a couple times and it didnât always work out,â a billionaire financier, speaking on the condition of anonymity, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/21/skeptical-dem-donors-tell-biden-they-will-not-raise-funds-for-him.html\">told</a> CNBC. âI think with Biden thereâs a feeling of âI like him, heâs a really good guy, but heâd be running at a moment in time that a 76-year-old white guy may not be what voters want.â I donât want to give chits today for Joe.

We already knew that the pair <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-entitled-hypocrisy-of-ivanka-trumps-personal-e-mail-account\">flouted rules they didnât think applied to them</a>, maintained business ties that may have put <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/kushners-disclosed-foreign-business-ties-pose-difficult-security-hurdle-to-clear-officials-say/2018/03/07/cf336a0c-2234-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html\">national security at risk</a>, and only received top-secret clearance by <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/jared-kushner-security-clearance\">whining and stomping their feet</a> until President Daddy gave it to them. And now, thanks to a new report, weâve learned that Javanka reportedly believe all the powers of the presidency apply to them.</p>\n<p><em>Kushner, Inc.,</em> out next week from journalist <strong>Vicky Ward,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/us/politics/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-book.html\">tells the story</a> of  âtwo children . . . who have climbed to positions of power by disregarding protocol and skirting the rules when they can.â Among the anecdotes Ward gleaned from interviewing 220 people are that âMs. Trump and Mr. Kushner wanted to control who could travel on trips funded by the State Department,â and that the couple, who apparently view Air Force One as their own personal plane, had a handy work-around in place for when they didnât get their way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ms. Trump . . . often requested to travel on Air Force planes when it was not appropriate. When <strong>Rex W. Tillerson,</strong> the former secretary of state, would deny the requests, the couple would invite along a Cabinet secretary, often Treasury Secretary <strong>Steven Mnuchin,</strong> to get access to a plane.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hey, itâs not like Mnuchin had anything better to do! Elsewhere in <em>Kushner, Inc.,</em> Ward reports that Ivanka suffers from the same condition as her father wherein they both believe they can convince people a thing that was said on tape and captured by numerous news outlets <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/trump-claims-he-was-totally-misinterpreted-otto-warmbiers\">never</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-insists-he-his-intelligence-chiefs-are-all-same-page-n965626\">actually</a> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-rnc-donors-apple-tim-cook-lie-2fd8b004-6fc3-4f81-9eb0-3b92f3264ef1.html\">happened</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When <strong>Gary D. Cohn</strong> was considering resigning as the top White House economic adviser after President Trump blamed âboth sidesâ in a deadly white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Va., his first stop was a meeting with Mr. Trumpâs children.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a conversation in August 2017 with Ivanka Trump . . . Mr. Cohn was shocked by her reaction to his concerns, according to a new book about Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. âMy dadâs not a racist; he didnât mean any of it,â Ms. Trump said of the presidentâs refusal to condemn white nationalists outright. Appearing to channel her father, <strong>she added, âThatâs not what he said.â</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The book does attempt to explain that the only reason Ivanka and Jared are like this is because they had super-tough childhoods, though, somehow, weâre not sure the anecdotes about Ivanka having to tour an elite boarding school on her own (after arriving in a stretch limo) and Jaredâs parents asking a business associate to occasionally take him out to dinner while he was at Harvard âto make sure he was not dating non-Jews or doing drugsâ will elicit much sympathy.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the White House and the Kushner/Trump camp have tried to discredit <em>Kushner, Inc.,</em> insisting, through a spokesman, that âEvery point that Ms. Ward mentioned in what she called her âfact-checkingâ stage was entirely false,â and that âIt seems she has written a book of fiction rather than any serious attempt to get the facts. Correcting everything wrong would take too long and be pointless.â</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Of course Wall Street execs were part of the bonkers college-admissions scam</strong></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, wealthy parents hoping to game the college-admissions system to get the apple of their eye into Harvard, Yale, or whatever college Billy or Buffy thought they deserved to attend did so the old-fashioned way: cutting a sizable check directly to the school. But apparently in 2019, donating a building or <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/remember-that-time-when-jared-kushner-s-dad-donated-2-1833241931\">seven figures to be used however</a> is considered downright passÃ©. At least, thatâs the takeaway from todayâs Justice Department indictment of <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/all-the-parents-named-in-the-college-admissions-scandal.html\">33 parents</a> who went about getting their kids into universities in a slightly different fashion: paying a âcollege-admissions adviserâ to help them cheat on standardized tests and bribe athletic directors to pass their cherubs off as recruits even if âthey did not play the sport they were purportedly recruited to play.â Hereâs more from <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/college-admissions-cheating-scandal.html\">on this scam for the ages</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the center of the sweeping financial crime and fraud case was <strong>William Singer,</strong> the founder of a college-preparatory business called the Edge College &amp; Career Network, also known as The Key. Federal prosecutors did not charge any students or universities with wrongdoing. The authorities said Mr. Singer, who has agreed to plead guilty to the charges and cooperated with federal prosecutors, used The Key and its nonprofit arm, Key Worldwide Foundation, which is based in Newport Beach, Calif., to help students cheat on their standardized tests, and to pay bribes to the coaches who could get them into college with fake athletic credentials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also implicated were top college coaches, who were accused of accepting millions of dollars to help admit students to Wake Forest, Yale, Stanford, the University of Southern California, and other schools.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Singer, according to the indictment, was paid $25 million between 2011 and February 2019, offering his clients&#8212;among them, actresses <strong>Felicity Huffman</strong> and <strong>Lori Loughlin,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-12/ex-pimco-ceo-douglas-hodge-among-those-charged-in-college-scheme\">PIMCO founder</a> <strong>Douglas Hodge,</strong> and a private-equity executive <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-12/tpg-s-bill-mcglashan-among-defendants-charged-in-college-scheme\">who runs his companyâs âsocial goodâ business</a>&#8212;an Ã  la carte menu of bespoke cheating services. (Hodge <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-12/ex-pimco-ceo-douglas-hodge-among-those-charged-in-college-scheme\">declined</a> a request for comment from Bloomberg. Reps for Loughlin and Huffman <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/hollywood-college-admissions-scandal-felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin\">have not responded to <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs requests for comment</a>.) Sometimes, prosecutors claim, he would pay off testing officials to change test scores after a student had taken the ACT or SAT. In other instances, he would reportedly bribe test proctors to give the kids extra time and, in some cases, give them answers, âcorrecting their work or even letting third parties falsely pose as their children and take the tests in their stead.â T.P.G. managing partner <strong>William McGlashan,</strong> i.e. the âsocial goodâ guy, was allegedly instructed to claim that his son had learning disabilities to get more time for the SATs, taken at a center where Singer had a proctor on the inside who was known to accept monetary compensation. (McGlashanâs son was unaware of the scam, according to court documents; neither McGlashan nor his firm responded to requests for comment.)</p>\n<p>As for the athletic recruitment angle, thatâs where the real artistry came into play, per the <em>Times:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Singer . . . helped parents go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit. Mr. Singer fabricated athletic âprofilesâ of students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors they had not won. Some parents supplied âstaged photographs of their children engaged in athletic activity,â according to the authorities; and Mr. Singerâs associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the Internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In one example detailed in an indictment, the parents of a student applying to Yale paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million to help her get admitted. The student, who did not play soccer, was described as the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in Southern California in order to be recruited for the Yale womenâs soccer team. The coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit the student.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âThis girl will be a midfielder and attending Yale so she has to be very good,â Mr. Singer wrote in an e-mail detailing instructions, adding that he would need âa soccer pic probably Asian girl.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Justice Department, the investigation, known as âOperation Varsity Blues,â is ongoing.</p>\n<p><strong>Goldman partners implicated in multi-billion-dollar heist banned from banking industry</strong></p>\n<p>This seems . . . <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-12/ex-goldman-bankers-leissner-and-ng-banned-from-industry-by-fed\">reasonable</a>? Particularly for the guy who already pleaded guilty to the crime:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bankers <strong>Tim Leissner</strong> and <strong>Roger Ng</strong> were banned from the industry by the U.S. Federal Reserve for their role in helping divert billions of dollars from the Malaysian state fund 1MDB. Leissner and Ng coordinated bond offerings that allowed funds to be stolen from 1MDB, the Fed said in a Tuesday statement. Some of the money was used to bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi, and criminals also used proceeds to pay for lavish lifestyles, according to regulator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Leissner, who agreed to the Fedâs permanent ban, was fined $1.42 million, according to the statement. He has already pleaded guilty to charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department, including conspiring to launder money. Ng, Leissnerâs deputy at Goldman Sachs, was indicted on similar charges in October. Last month, Malaysia said it will extradite Ng to the U.S. after he has completed legal proceedings in local courts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lawyer for Leissner declined Bloombergâs request for comment; an attorney who has represented Ng didnât respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs spokesman <strong>Michael DuVally</strong> offered that âgiven the Department of Justiceâs charges, this development is hardly surprising.â</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Regulator Slams Wells Fargo After C.E.O.

In a scathing opening monologue, Oliver addressed the would-be political power couple that is <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> and <strong>Jared Kushner.</strong> <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance.html\">allegedly ordered</a> top-secret security clearance for his son-in-law, though Ivanka has said that her father had nothing to do with her husbandâs security clearance. Oliver couldnât resist mercilessly lampooning that claim, but only after heâd laid into her father and husband first.</p>\n<p>The presidentâs alleged order to grant top-secret security clearance to Kushner&#8212;who Oliver joked âwill be referred to as âDiminutive Nothing Boy 1â in the Mueller reportâ&#8212;reportedly raised concerns for both former White House chief of staff <strong>John Kelly</strong> and former White House counsel <strong>Don McGahn.</strong> In fact, the two <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance.html\">reportedly</a> wrote internal memos about their concerns at the time. But Oliver couldnât imagine why either of the men would have bothered.</p>\n<p>âThe fuck is Trump supposed to do with a memo raising concerns?!â the comedian scoffed. âRead it? A <em>memo</em>? With what? His <em>eyes</em>? For what possible reason? So he can <em>know stuff</em>? To what end? So he can <em>do</em> stuff? Why?! So he can get more memos about the stuff heâs doing? Nice try, memos!â</p>\n<p>Oliver also detailed a number of concerns regarding Trumpâs baby-faced senior adviser-slash-son-in-law, including the fact that several foreign entities have apparently seen him as a target for manipulation. But the most worrying thing about Kushner, according to Oliver, is not his political prowess or lack thereof, but his perfectly taut, glowing skin.</p>\n<p>âHow the fuck does he look so well rested?â Oliver said. âThis is a guy whoâs not just brokering peace in the Middle East; heâs tackling the opioid crisis, and national infrastructure as the head of the Office of American Innovation, while constantly traveling halfway around the world, and doing it all while navigating the psychosexual Stalingrad that is marriage to Donald Trumpâs daughter. Where are the bags under his eyes? How is his skin so smooth? It is deeply worrisome how unworried he looks!â</p>\n<p>Yet both Kushner and Ivanka have denied on the record that Kushner ever received special treatment. In an interview with ABC, Ivanka vehemently denied it once more&#8212;and thatâs what prompted Oliver to drop the harshest reality check of all.</p>\n<p>âOh, please,â Oliver said. âI honestly donât know whatâs sadder there. Either Ivanka is knowingly lying about her dad forcing her and Jaredâs security clearance through, or she genuinely thinks they got it on merit on their own. And if it is the latter, Ivanka, there are some things that you really should know.</p>\n<p>âYou only became an executive vice president of the Trump Organization at 24 because youâre Donald Trumpâs daughter&#8212;not because you were a 24-year-old business prodigy,â Oliver said. âYou only got a book deal because youâre Donald Trumpâs daughter&#8212;not because youâre a brilliant author and wordsmith. And you only hosted the Miss Teen U.S.A. pageant because your dad owned the contest&#8212;not for your sparkling on-camera presence. Oh, and you know how Santa Claus used to visit every Christmas morning to give you presents? Well, that wasnât the real Santa. That was <strong>Michael Cohen</strong>&#8212;and trust me, he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-cohen-testimony-donald-trump-late-night\">wonât</a> be coming down your

One stop on his itinerary is likely to steal the show.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>This weekend, <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> will board a military plane and embark on a six-country trip to present foreign diplomats with part of his long-awaited proposal to solve an epic quandary and bring peace to the Middle East. Kushner has said that he and the other members of the trip, including Middle East envoy <strong>Jason Greenblatt,</strong> State Department policy adviser <strong>Brian Hook,</strong> and deputy assistant to the president <strong>Avi Berkowitz,</strong> will not present the full peace plan until after the Israeli elections in April. Instead, they will gauge support for various economic incentives in the proposal, including foreign aid for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. These enticements are intended to persuade Palestinian officials to seek a broader deal.</p>\n<p>Over the course of seven days, Kushnerâs team will travel to Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey. They will also make a stop in Saudi Arabia, where Kushner plans to meet with Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman.</strong> It will be the first time the two will meet since 15 Saudis brutally strangled <em>Washington Post</em> journalist Jamal Khashoggi and dismembered him with a bone saw last fall.</p>\n<p>Kushner and M.B.S., as he is known, struck up a relationship nearly two years ago, when the Saudi prince visited the White House. Kushner and M.B.S., youthful heirs with complex family rivalries, have met a handful of times since. For a while, it was a mutually beneficial alliance. M.B.S. provided Kushner with a key ally and envoy in the region. Kushner, in turn, convinced his father-in-law to make Riyadh his first stop on a sweeping presidential tour of the Middle East, and helped promote an arms deal between the United States and the kingdom. But their bond came under great scrutiny last fall, after the assassination of Khashoggi.</p>\n<p>In the days following, Kushner reached out to M.B.S as the administration launched its investigation, and urged him to be as transparent as possible. (The C.I.A. later concluded that M.B.S. ordered the operation, although the Saudi government has denied the crown prince played any role in the killing.) In a rare town-hall interview with CNN in October, Kushner offered a chilling realpolitik explanation for the administrationâs failure to condemn the Saudis. âWe have to be able to work with our allies,â he said. âThe Middle East is a rough place. Itâs been a rough place for a very long time, and we have to be able to pursue our strategic objectives, but we also have to deal with what obviously seems to be a terrible situation.â</p>\n<p>The uncomfortable optics of the meeting are not lost on those planning the road show. But Kushner is meeting with the heads of states from the region, a person familiar with the trip explained, and M.B.S. is a head of state. Indeed, Saudi Arabia appears to be the lynchpin of Kushnerâs unprecedented strategy to forge lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Whereas past administrations sought to negotiate with both parties, the Trump White House is hoping to assemble a coalition of Gulf states aligned against Iran to exert influence in the region.</p>\n<p>The whirlwind tour will come on the heels of a two-day conference in Warsaw last week, during which Kushner met with leaders from 60 countries and obliquely discussed the plan. Israeli Prime Minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu,</strong> who was in attendance during Kushnerâs closed-door presentation, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-gulf-states-commend-kushners-peace-effort-11550182508\">congratulated</a> him for being âcrazy enoughâ to âcome up with ideasâ to resolve the conflict. A foreign-affairs minister from Saudi Arabia also offered support for Kushnerâs plan, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Palestinian officials, who have not engaged in peace talks since the U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem, did not attend the conference. On Friday, Kushner, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, joined Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong> at Auschwitz-Birkenau, before they flew to Germany for the weekend to attend the Munich Security Conference. Kushnerâs wife, <strong>Ivanka Trump,</strong> also made the trip.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Much has been said recently, both inside and outside the White House, about Jared and Ivankaâs influence within the Trump administration. The couple survived a series of power struggles with <strong>Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus,</strong> and finally <strong>John Kelly.</strong> With the West Wing thinned out, aides have been referring to Kushner as the de facto chief of staff, one person close to the couple told me. But itâs not that Jared or Ivanka have more power as a result of others leaving. Itâs that Trumpworld is finally beginning to understand the extent of the power theyâve had all along. âTheyâve always been son and daughter of a president who is a famously familial person,â this person said. âThe people who misunderstood that are no longer there. Everything takes time, and they have the luxury of time in this administration when most other people do not.â</p>\n<p>Trump, of course, is most comfortable when the West Wing is operating as a family office. It was how he ran his business in Trump Tower, and it remains the best way to assess who has staying power. It also helps to explain why, despite an anti-nepotism law that stood for 50 years, he deputized his son-in-law to lead some of the most significant foreign-policy initiatives of his administration, and why his daughter frequently represents the administration on trips abroad. While the rest of the White House is in a state of constant turnover, Kushner remains firmly ensconced in a closet of an office near the Oval. Ivanka has a sunny corner room just upstairs, outside of which hangs a blown-up photo of her and Kushner dancing onstage at inauguration, with a note from her dad scrawled out in gold Sharpie, saying how proud of them he was.</p>\n<p>They still worry about how they are portrayed in the media, though the negative press has slowed as their antagonists have left the White House. When Ivanka sat down with ABC for an interview earlier this year, she was caught off guard by questions she thought had been deemed off-limits, according to two people familiar with the situation. But as time has gone on, Jared and Ivanka, like everyone else, have cared less and less about about each individual story. The country, after all, has reached a late stage of Trump fatigue. Though news cameras panned to take in Ivankaâs stony expression in Munich when German chancellor <strong>Angela Merkel</strong> criticized her fatherâs foreign policy, the schadenfreude was fleeting. Back in New York, their social circle is similarly dazed. One former friend of the couple shrugged when NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/officials-rejected-jared-kushner-top-secret-security-clearance-were-overruled-n962221\">reported</a> that Kushner had only gotten his security clearance restored after a Trump appointee overrode the recommendation of career White House security specialists. âTomorrow, no one is going to talk about this,â this person said. âIs anything ever going to stick?â</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Middle East","socialTitle":"Jared Kushner Is Preparing for Another Face-to-Face Meeting with M.B.S.","socialDescription":"Kushner is embarking on a six-country tour to begin rolling out his Middle East peace plan.

According to Politico, Kushner has been working behind the scenes on a plan to expand some forms of legal immigration in an effort to âincrease the number of low- and high-skilled workersâ in the country. Even Trump, who delights in spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric and stoking xenophobic fears, seems to be on board, calling this week for more legal immigrants to ârun the factories and plants and companies that are moving back in.â</p>\n<p>One person who may be less enthused? Miller, who has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/03/jared-kushner-expand-legal-immigration-1249950\">reportedly</a> been only peripherally involved in the effort, and whose restrictionist views likely put him at odds with Kushner. âThe different factions in the White House represent different factions among Republicans,â an immigration activist involved in Kushnerâs efforts told Politico. âIt sure looks like the folks who want an expansion are winning.â</p>\n<p>Ironically enough, the schism comes as the president ramps up his draconian efforts to halt illegal immigration, including a threat to shut down the United Statesâ southern border and a seemingly counterproductive call to cut aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras&#8212;a plan experts say could actually <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/04/02/709089322/u-s-decision-to-cut-central-american-aid-could-worsen-migrant-crisis-experts-say\"><em>increase</em></a> the number of migrants seeking entry into the U.S. Those efforts, harebrained though they may be, are in keeping with Trumpâs rhetoric on the campaign trail and in office. But in recent months, the president has also made calls to increase legal immigration, including an ad-libbed line in Februaryâs <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-state-union-address-2/\">State of the Union address</a> in which he said he âwant[s] people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever.â</p>\n<p>According to Politico, Kushner has been put in charge of those efforts, potentially teeing up an inter-administration showdown between his views and Millerâs. Kushner has long been viewed as a more moderate member of the Trump administration, in part on the basis of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/criminal-justice-reform-bill-metaphor-for-the-trump-presidency-that-wasnt\">bipartisan criminal-justice reform package</a> that he helped ferry through Congress. Miller, on the other hand, is among the last remaining members of a cadre of fringe figures like <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> and <strong>Sebastian Gorka</strong> that initially populated the Trump administration. Miller has survived in the administration as one of Trumpâs closest advisers in large part because, as Politico noted, his anti-immigrant views appear to align with those of the president. Indeed, Miller has been one of the primary architects of Trumpâs hard-line immigration agenda, and the wordsmith behind much of the presidentâs fear-mongering rhetoric.</p>\n<p>If Kushner gets his way, that could change. But itâs unclear how the First Son-in-Lawâs plans will play out. Despite <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/06/immigration-trump-says-he-wants-more-legal-migrants-u-s/2792732002/\">telling reporters</a> Wednesday that we âneed people coming in,â Trump has shown no sign of letting up on his efforts to target undocumented immigrants. Even if Kushner can sway the president, Miller would need to sign off on the final plan, meaning he could bury this effort the way he has <a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article193865169.html\">other potential immigration compromises</a>. And, of course, thereâs the matter of Kushner himself who, despite seeing a criminal-justice reform bill to the finish line, has been largely feckless in his supposed attempts to draw the president

reason <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> and <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> received top-secret security clearance last May was because President Daddy <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance.html\">demanded</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/05/politics/ivanka-trump-security-clearance-pressure/index.html\">it</a>, over the objections of intelligence officials, the White Houseâs top lawyer, and the chief of staff at the time, all of whom worried that the First Daughter and Son-in-Lawâs business entanglements and lack of experience made them prime targets for manipulation by foreign powers. (This was particularly true of of Kushner, whose family recently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/qatar-666-5th-ave-jared-kushner\">received a bailout from his new friends in the Middle East</a>.) And now, weâve <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/white-house-whistleblower-says-security-clearance-denials-were-reversed-during-trump-administration/2019/04/01/9f28334e-542c-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e_story.html\">learned</a> that Javanka werenât the only ones who allegedly got the green light to access Americaâs most important intelligence, despite major red flags in their files. According to whistleblower testimony from a longtime security adviser, overturning clearance denials for individuals with major skeletons in their closets has become something of an official Trump administration policy!</p>\n<p>Speaking to lawmakers last week, <strong>Tricia Newbold,</strong> an 18-year career employee currently serving in the White House Personnel Security Office, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000169-d8ff-dc59-a16d-feff50910001\">said</a> she âwould not be doing a service to myself, my country, or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security.â Newbold said that in 2018, she began keeping a list of White House employees whose security-clearance denials had been overruled, a list that grew to a mind-boggling 25 names, âincluding two current senior White House officials, as well as contractors and individuals.â During her interview with the Committee on Oversight and Reform, Newbold said the individuals had received denials due to a âwide range of serious disqualifying issues involving foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use, and criminal conduct.â While she understood that her and other career employeesâ decisions could be overruled, she was initially concerned âthat these decisions were occurring without proper analysis, documentation, or a full understanding and acceptance of the risks.â Newbold, who said she exhausted all avenues to resolve her concerns before coming to the Committee, accused Director of Personnel Security <strong>Carl Kline</strong> of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Trying to get her to change her denial recommendation for a âhigh-profile official at the National Security Council,â with whom she said Kline spoke on the phone with daily;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Failing to address âdisqualifying concernsâ listed by Newbold and a first-line adjudicator when it came to overturning a denial for a senior White House official, and merely noting in the file that the worrisome âactivities occurred prior to Federal serviceâ;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Telling Newbold âdo not touchâ the application of a second âvery senior White House official,â who another reviewer believed had âmultiple disqualifiers, including foreign influence and outside activitiesâ (Kline granted this person a security clearance);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementing a policy wherein the White House no longer checks the credit of applicants&#8212;which prevents reviewers from knowing whether applicants âcould be susceptible to blackmail, depending on their debtsâ;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overseeing a situation wherein the White House was âgetting out of controlâ with the number of interim security clearances granted, enabling individuals to access sensitive, classified information for long periods of time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps most disturbing was the retaliation Newbold said she experienced for raising concerns about risks to national security, according to the committeeâs summary of her interview:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Ms. Newbold, the retaliation against her for raising her national security concerns began in January of 2018, when Mr. Kline began taking actions that were designed to humiliate her as a result of her rare form of dwarfism. According to Ms. Newbold, Mr. Kline repeatedly altered her office environment to cause impediments to her work, such as physically elevating personnel security files out of her reach. Ms. Newbold informed Committee staff: âThese are files that we work with every day. Thatâs an essential part of our job.â She explained that when she let Mr. Kline know this was a problem, he replied, âI have people, they can get the files for me.â Ms. Newbold responded, âno, sir, thatâs not acceptable accommodation.â She raised her concerns repeatedly to Employee Relations personnel and other White House officials, but it took approximately two months to make an accommodation so she could reach the files. According to Ms. Newbold, the files were moved out of her reach again in the spring of 2018 and yet again in October 2018.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Newbold, who said she was suspended without pay for 14 days in late January despite âno prior formal disciplinary actionâ in her 18 years on the job, and subsequently removed from her position as a direct supervisor, told the panel sheâs âterrified of going back,â adding, âI know that this will not be perceived in favor of my intentions, which is to bring back the integrity of the office.â</p>\n<p>In a letter to White House counsel <strong>Pat Cipollone,</strong> Representative <strong>Elijah Cummings</strong> wrote that âin light of the grave reports from this whistleblower&#8212;and the ongoing refusal of the White House to provide the information we need to conduct our investigation&#8212;the committee now plans to proceed with compulsory process and begin authorizing subpoenas, starting at tomorrowâs business meeting.â Republicans, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-04-01-Memo-to-COR-Members-re-WH-Security-Clearance-Transcribed-Interview.pdf\">say</a> Democrats are âmisusingâ Newboldâs testimony to âembarrass senior White House officialsâ and âmanufacture a misleading narrative that the Trump White House is reckless with our national security.â Theyâre also not entirely sure Newbold can be trusted due to complaints she raised about Kline&#8212;who, as a reminder, seemingly retaliated against her by, among other things, placing files where she couldnât reach them.

Moore continued failing to pay, according to the court filings, prompting the judge to order the sale of his house to satisfy the debt in 2013. But this process was halted by his ex-wife after Moore paid her about two-thirds of what he owed, the filings say.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a divorce filing in August 2010, Moore was accused of inflicting âemotional and psychological abuseâ on his ex-wife during their 20-year marriage. Allison Moore said in the filing she had been forced to flee their home to protect herself. She was granted a divorce in May 2011. Moore said in a court filing signed in April 2011 he admitted all the allegations in Allison Mooreâs divorce complaint. He declined to comment for this article . . . Allison Moore declined to comment during a brief telephone discussion this week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last week, we <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/stephen-moore-fed-taxes\">learned</a> that in addition to being unqualified for the Fed job in the eyes of virtually every economist to walk the earth, Moore also owes the I.R.S. more than $75,000, which his current wife insists is simply a matter of not knowing how to properly file taxes and not âan attempt at defrauding the U.S. government.â</p>\n<p><strong>Lawmaker whose company committed massive Medicare fraud is Trumpâs pick to fix health care</strong></p>\n<p>Last week, fresh off the news that the Attorney General he appointed to shield him from obstruction charges <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/nancy-pelosi-barr-mueller-report\">had done just that</a>, Donald Trump celebrated by declaring war on Obamacare. Despite the fact that Republicans spent nearly a decade, and Trumpâs first year in office, trying and failing to repeal and replace the law, the administration chose to throw its weight behind a lawsuit attempting to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, with no alternative waiting in the wings. But donât worry! Trumpâs got a guy. Meet <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-scott-trump-health-20190401-story.html\">Senator <strong>Rick Scott</strong></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As Floridaâs governor, he presided over an epic decline in the stateâs insurance coverage rate. He refused to accept Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, depriving 1.4 million residents of coverage they would have received with the change. Scott presents himself as a health-care expert. He boasts: âI ran one of the largest health-care companies in the world.â That company is Columbia/HCA, which Scott ran until 1997. He left just months after the federal government announced a sprawling investigation into whether the company had systematically defrauded Medicare, Medicaid, and other government health-care programs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The results of that investigation? The âlargest government fraud settlement in U.S. history,â which involved Columbia/H.C.A. and several of its subsidiaries pleading guilty to 14 criminal counts and paying more than $1.7 billion in fines and penalties. Stay tuned for Act II!</p>\n<p><strong>Trump is down to two candidates for newly created âimmigration czarâ job</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/40654a1b83eb45e3b661903305083d9e\">According to the Associated Press</a>, the president is considering former Kansas Secretary of State <strong>Kris Kobach</strong> and former Virginia Attorney General <strong>Ken Cuccinelli,</strong> meaning the selection process is a little bit like a sweepstakes for assholes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kobach, an immigration hard-liner, ran a failed bid for governor promising to drive immigrants living in the U.S. illegally out of the country and has recently been working for a nonprofit corporation, WeBuildtheWall Inc., which has been raising private money to build Trumpâs wall. Cuccinelli, meanwhile, has advocated for denying citizenship to American-born children of parents living in the U.S. illegally, limiting in-state tuition at public universities only to those who are citizens or legal residents, and allowing workers to file lawsuits when an employer knowingly hires someone living in the country illegally for taking a job from a âlaw abiding competitor.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the bright side, Representative <strong>Steve</strong> â<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/steve-king-trump-immigration-wall.html\">When did white nationalism become a bad thing</a>â <strong>King</strong> is not said to be under consideration for the job, <em>that we know of.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Lyftâs Tumbling Stock Is a Worrying Sign for Other Unicorns (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-01/lyft-s-tumbling-stock-is-a-worrying-sign-for-other-unicorns?srnd=premium\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Yale Grad Accused of Running Hedge-Fund Scam While in School (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-01/21-year-old-yale-alum-accused-of-running-hedge-fund-scam-by-sec?srnd=premium\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Aramco Tops Apple as Worldâs Most Profitable Company (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/aramco-is-the-most-profitable-company-on-earth-ratings-agencies-say-11554102173\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Pete Buttigieg</strong> raises $7M before announcing presidential run (<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/04/01/pete-buttigieg-raises-7-million-before-announcing-presidential-run/\"><em>N.Y.P.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Saudis accessed Amazon C.E.O.

The administration isnât worried!","body":"<p>Something you may have picked up on over the past 30 months is that the Trump administration considers Saudi Arabia to be a close personal friend, the kind for whom it would do just about anything. Thus far, that has included arming the erratic, murderous kingdom with <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/11/29/us-saudi-arabia-arms-deal/\">billions of dollars&#39; worth of missiles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/magnitsky-sanctions-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi\">letting</a> it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/trump-saudi-arabia-oil-tweet\">get away</a> with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html\">murdering a U.S. resident</a>, while one-time allies like France, Germany, the U.K., and Canada are <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/trump-officials-defend-telling-canada-to-rot-in-hell\">told to rot in hell</a>. And now, the U.S. is taking things to the next level. <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-companies-granted-authorizations-for-nuclear-work-in-saudi\">According</a> to the Daily Beast, the Trump administration has given six U.S. companies the green light to sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, a relationship milestone every authoritarian nation dreams of. Per the Beast:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Federal law stipulates that companies obtain clearance from the U.S. government for exporting nuclear technology to or engaging in the production or development of special nuclear material in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The authorizations&#8212;known as Part 810s, referring to a clause in federal regulations&#8212;allow U.S. companies to divulge specific details about plans for working in Saudi Arabia and certain information about the nuclear technology. For example, a company would need a Part 810 to transfer physical documents, electronic media, or the âtransfer of knowledge and expertiseâ to Saudi Arabia, according to the Department of Energy. Itâs been unclear to what extent the U.S. government, and U.S. companies, have communicated with Riyadh about nuclear energy, especially in the wake of the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and amid claims by Democrats on the Hill that individuals in the national security community attempted to discuss a nuclear deal with Riyadh without going through the proper regulatory approval process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this month, First Son-in-Law <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> had an <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/jared-kushner-saudi-arabia-mbs-meeting\">intimate reunion</a> with his buddy <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong> that U.S. Embassy staffers were reportedly barred from attending, âraising concern by Democratic lawmakers that Kushner and M.B.S. had discussed a nuclear deal with minimal oversight.â (The meeting, it should be noted, came just a week after reports that Kushner only received top-secret security clearance <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/jared-kushner-security-clearance\">because <strong>Donald Trump</strong> demanded it</a>, overriding the concerns of the F.B.I., which expressed question about whether Kushnerâs business entanglements and utter lack of experience made him a ripe target for manipulation.) During a hearing on Wednesday with Secretary of State <strong>Mike Pompeo,</strong> Representative <strong>Brad Sherman</strong> questioned the 810 authorizations, noting that while it is in the U.S.âs interest âto prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon . . . what Iâve seen in this administration recently . . . is an effort to evade Congress and to some extent evade your department and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while [the country] refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment.â</p>\n<p>Kush is not the only Saudi link to the Trump administration. Last month, NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/flynn-backed-plan-transfer-nuclear-tech-saudis-may-have-broken-n973021\">reported</a> that before he was unceremoniously canned, disgraced former national security adviser <strong>Mike Flynn</strong>&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/ivanka-trump-helping-choose-next-world-bank-president\">an <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> hire</a>&#8212;was seemingly attempting âto transfer sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabiaâ in what appeared to be âa scheme for [a group of retired] generals to make some money.â (Flynn did not respond to NBCâs request for comment.) All of which is to say that, really, it was only a matter of time before the shoulder-rubbing commenced in plain view.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why is Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/why-donald-trump-is-obsessed-with-orourke?inline\">obsessed with Beto OâRourke?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/the-boeing-tragedy-is-just-the-beginning-of-the-self-driving-techpocalypse?inline\">self-driving techpocalypse:</a> the Boeing tragedy is just the beginning</p>\n<p>&#8212; Inside the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/inside-hollywoods-disney-fox-freakout?inline\">Disney-Fox Freakout</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-vs-biden?inline\">Beto vs. Biden:</a> who is Obamaâs true heir apparent?</p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story?inline\">Cover story:</a> Riding around with Beto OâRourke as he comes to grips with a presidential run</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Nuclear Technology","socialTitle":"Trump Admin Weirdly Eager to Hand the Saudis Nuclear Secrets","socialDescription":"Lawmakers want to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon.

âunwittingâ partner in the deal.","body":"<p>Last August, an economic miracle occurred. Eleven years after a young <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> purchased an aging skyscraper that would become an albatross around his familyâs neck, and six months before the Kushners would have to cough up the $1.4 billion that was due on the mortgage for 666 Fifth Avenue, a Canadian asset-management company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/nyregion/kushners-building-fifth-avenue-brookfield-lease.html\">swooped in</a> and agreed to take a 99-year lease on the building, paying a near-centuryâs worth of rent upfront. The bailout was surprising for a few reasons, chief among them being comments by the Kushnersâ previous partner that 666 Fifth â<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/is-jared-kushner-the-worlds-worst-real-estate-investor\">would be worth a lot more if it was just dirt</a>,â plus the fact that the family had spent two years trying to get new partners or financing to no avail. Also, there was the matter of the Qatar Investment Authority being a major investor in the company, Brookfield Asset Management, and Kushnerâs <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-backed-qatar-blockade-after-qataris-wouldnt-finance-his-property-828847\">support of a Saudi- and U.A.E.-led blockade of Qatar</a>. To some, it sure <em>sounded</em> like a foreign government was trying to influence policy by greasing the presidentâs son-in-lawâs wheels! At the time, Brookfield told reporters that the Qataris âhad no knowledge of the deal before its public announcementâ&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/nyregion/kushner-deal-qatar-666-5th.html\">apparently they donât read <em>The New York Times</em></a>&#8212;and now that the deal has officially gone through, Doha is doubling down, insisting, somewhat curiously, that the government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qatar-fund-kushner-insight/qatar-revamps-investment-strategy-after-kushner-building-bailout-idUSKCN1Q00W3\">had absolutely nothing to do with the 666 debacle</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When news emerged that Qatar may have unwittingly helped bail out a New York skyscraper owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Donald Trumpâs son-in-law, eyebrows were raised in Doha. . . . The bailout, in which Doha played no part and first learned about in the media, has prompted a rethink of how the gas-rich kingdom invests money abroad via its giant sovereign wealth fund, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The country has decided that the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) will aim to avoid putting money in funds or other investment vehicles it does not have full control over, according to the sources, who are familiar with the QIAâs strategy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âQatar started looking into how its name got involved into the deal and found out it was because of a fund it co-owned,â said one of the sources. âSo QIA ultimately triggered a strategy revamp.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is it possible that Qatar truly had no knowledge of its role in doing a major solid for the Kushners just months before a make-or-break deadline? Sure, just like literally anything is possible. But many are suspicious!</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/jedshug/status/1095198659870945281\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jedshug/status/1095198659870945281\">https://twitter.com/jedshug/status/1095198659870945281</a></p></blockquote></div><div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1095362087038140416\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1095362087038140416\">https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1095362087038140416</a></p></blockquote></div><p>In addition to likely having had the chance to hear about the deal through Brookfield directly or read about it in the paper of record, one would imagine the Qataris were keeping tabs on all things Kushner on account of Jaredâs father, <strong>Charles Kushner,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-companies-confirms-meeting-with-qatar-on-financing/2018/03/18/55e281ac-1e3c-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html\">taking a meeting</a> with Qatarâs finance minister, <strong>Ali Sharif Al Emadi</strong> in April 2017. (Kushner the Elder later said he accepted the invite purely â<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/jared-kushners-dad-leave-my-boy-alone\">out of respect</a>â for the Qataris to tell them there was no way âwe could do business.â) So why is Doha taking pains to insist it accidentally bailed out the First-in-Laws on their no good, very bad investment now?

So letâs just zero in on the money.\n<p>âIâm <em>really</em> rich,â Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a âSummary of Net Worthâ balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to âin excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.â (The caps are his.)</p>\n<p>Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, itâs really anybodyâs guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. <em>Forbes</em> put his net worth at $4.5 billion. <em>Fortune</em> postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was âcloser to $2.9 billion.â</p>\n<p>In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. â<em>Forbes</em> is a bankrupt magazine, doesnât know what theyâre talking about.â â<em>Fortune</em> has no idea what my assets areâ and âhas totally lost its way.â But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his âfriend,â the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. âMaybe Michael told them to do it,â Trump speculated in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> âbecause he always wanted to do what Iâm doing.â Perhaps wisely, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&#8212;wouldnât venture any closer than âjust a back-of-the-envelope calculationâ of $2.56 billion, âwhich shouldnât be taken too seriously.â</p>\n<p>In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"searchable":true,"expired":false,"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/donald-trump","distributionChannels":[{"name":"web-owned-and-operated","metadata":{"searchable":true}}],"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","revision":5,"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Colbert Fires Back at Trump, Insists His Comedy Is Not âOne-Sidedâ","promoHed":"Colbert Fires Back at Trump, Insists His Comedy Is Not âOne-Sidedâ","dek":"âI can make fun of the president from <em>every</em> angle.â","promoDek":"âI can make fun of the president from <em>every</em> angle.â","body":"<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMfNlPDISHg\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>It appears the <strong>Donald Trump</strong>-vs.-late-night feud has begun once more in earnest. On Wednesday, the president <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/donald-trump-jay-leno-late-night-one-sided\">tweeted</a> an out-of-context quote about something said by <strong>Jay Leno,</strong> using it to decry the âone-sidedâ nature of todayâs late-night programs. The president has, of course, feuded with comedians several times in the past about all sorts of things&#8212;but perhaps none more so than <strong>Stephen Colbert,</strong> who responded to the presidentâs complaints Wednesday night by insisting, âThe comedy I do is not one-sided. I can make fun of the president from <em>every</em> angle.â</p>\n<p>ââJay Leno points out that comedy (on the very boring late night shows) is totally one-sided. Itâs tough when thereâs only one topic,ââ Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1105789414565908480\">tweeted</a> Wednesday, seemingly quoting a <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> segment on the subject. âActually, the one-sided hatred on these shows is incredible and for me, unwatchable. But remember, WE are number one - President!â</p>\n<p>âJust a little correction,â Colbert countered. âActually, <em>we</em> are No. 1, <em>The Late Show.</em> And I donât hate the president. I just donât trust him. Like, I donât hate the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/13/trump-issues-executive-order-grounding-all-boeing-737-max-8-and-max-9-jets.html\">737 Max 8</a>, but Iâm not getting on board!â</p>\n<p>Lenoâs full comments, as said on the third hour of NBCâs <em>Today</em> show, read like so: âI kind of used Johnny [Carson]âs model [on <em>Tonight</em>]. People couldnât figure out&#8212;âWell, you and your Republican friendsâ; âWell, Mr. Leno, you and your Democratic buddies.â And I would get hate mail from both sides equally, and I went, âOh thatâs fabulous. Thatâs exactly what I want.â But when people see you as one-sided, it just makes it tough. And plus, you know, I did it when, you know, <strong>Clinton</strong> was horny and <strong>Bush</strong> was dumb. It was just a little easier. You know, now itâs all very serious.â The comedian also logged an appearance Wednesday night on his former network home, <em>The Tonight Show,</em> where he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kPum8t3ZFs\">took over</a> <strong>Jimmy Fallonâs</strong> monologue as part of a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/jay-leno-tonight-show-monologue\">recurring bit</a>. He did not at any point mention Trump.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQYPEo4cfyk\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>Meanwhile, on ABC, <strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> was just as miffed as Colbert, reading Trumpâs tweet aloud and saying snidely, âWhat a snowflake.â Responding to Lenoâs point that in those halcyon olden days of late night, âClinton was horny and Bush was dumb,â Kimmel agreed that these days, the political landscape is tougher to cover&#8212;âbecause Trump is dumb <em>and</em> horny at the same time.â</p>\n<p>As for the idea that late-night comedians cover Trump too much? Kimmel said he and his colleagues would <em>love</em> to cover the president less&#8212;if he gave them any choice. âBefore 10 oâclock this morning, his former campaign chairman was sentenced to prison for the second time in a week,â Kimmel said. âHe called himself the most successful president in history, and he tweeted to let people know his wife hasnât been replaced with a body double. Iâm <em>not</em> supposed to mention that?!â</p>\n<p>â<strong>Obama</strong> wore mom jeans one time; we made jokes about it for six straight years,â Kimmel continued. âHow about this? You stop being terrible, weâll stop pointing it out. O.K.?â</p>\n<p>But perhaps the funniest detail in all this was one tiny coincidence that Colbertâs team discovered. Soon after his late-night rant, the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1105789862853128192\">tweeted</a> âMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!â, followed, 27 seconds later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1105789962576973824\">by</a> âKEEP AMERICA GREAT!â That, Colbert said, <em>obviously</em> means that the few seconds between those tweets was the exact moment when America became great. âThatâs just science!â</p>\n<p>âSo the question is, what did Trump see on Fox News at 7:17 A.M.?â Colbert said. âWell, we looked, and this is true, it was an Arbyâs commercial.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/10-undeniable-facts-about-the-michael-jackson-sexual-abuse-allegations?inline\">10 undeniable facts</a> about Michael Jacksonâs sexual abuse allegations</p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/bob-greenblatt-hbo-plepler-battle-with-netflix?inline\">new HBO</a>&#8212;and its coming battle with Netflix</p>\n<p>&#8212; <em>Captain Marvel</em> is a period piece, a space adventure, and an attempt at feminist filmmaking&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/captain-marvel-movie-review?inline\">and, our critic writes, it mostly succeeds</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Thought <em>Borat</em> was daring?

href=\"http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/\">boasted</a> to supporters that he was going to build âa great, great wall on our southern borderâ and make Mexico pay for it. Shortly thereafter, that became <em>taxpayers will put up the money but <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-president-niinisto-finland-joint-press-conference/\">Mexico will reimburse us</a>,</em> which changed to <em>Mexico will pay <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-president-niinisto-finland-joint-press-conference/\">through tariffs</a>,</em> and then <em>Mexico will pay â<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/11/trump-claims-mexico-will-pay-for-his-border-wall-through-nafta.html\">indirectly through NAFTA</a>,â</em> which preceded <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/local-moron-now-claims-mexico-border-wall-will-pay-for-itself\">the wall will pay for itself</a></em>, which turned into <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-didnt-realize-a-government-shutdown-would-shut-down-the-government\">Congress will fund it and if they donât Iâll shut down this whole damn government</a>.</em> That, of course, was followed by an attempt <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">to scrape the money together via a national emergency</a> that Congress voted down and which Trump <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/03/15/president-trump-first-veto-congress-border-national-emergency/\">is still trying to make happen</a>. In the meantime, however, the administration has a new plan of sorts: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/20/trump-wants-to-use-a-big-banking-settlement-to-help-build-the-wall.html\">make the French pay</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The White House is targeting a windfall from an international banking scandal to help pay for the border wall, according to an administration official. French bank Societe Generale struck a deal with the U.S government in November to pay $1.3 billion after admitting that it violated U.S. sanctions on Cuba and Iran for years. . . . The administration is hoping to funnel as much as $359 million from that settlement to a special account at the Treasury Department to fund the wall, the official said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be fair, this isnât the <em>worst</em> idea Team Trump has come up with wall funding, setting aside the fact that <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/sixty-percent-of-americans-oppose-trumps-border-wall-poll\">most Americans donât want the thing</a> and would probably prefer that money be spent elsewhere. Unfortunately, thereâs also the minor matter of it potentially being illegal for Trump to appropriate the cash to build his fence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. . . itâs unclear whether the White House can use the money for the wall. The Treasury account&#8212;known as the asset forfeiture fund&#8212;is made up of cash, property and other items seized during civil and criminal investigations. Use of the funds is restricted by federal law, and the account itself is a lightning rod for criticism, with both conservatives and liberals calling it an example of government overreach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âFundamentally, this is a slush fund of money taken from private citizens that law enforcement officials are allowed to use for their own purposes,â said <strong>Robert McNamara,</strong> a senior attorney with the libertarian Institute for Justice. âIf Congress is supposed to be in charge of appropriations, we shouldnât be setting up funds that the executive can self-fund based on how many people it shakes down,â McNamara said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other ideas that have been thrown around include using disaster money that would otherwise go to areas affected by things like deadly hurricanes and, more recently, using funds intended for military construction, pay, and pensions. Shockingly, none of those suggestions have gone over too well, but the latter was seen as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-may-tap-military-pay-pensions-for-border-wall/2019/03/07/0e3b37d4-411a-11e9-85ad-779ef05fd9d8_story.html\">particularly egregious</a>. âMore than $10 billion of other top priorities that the military and their families have requested over the last several years is on the chopping block to placate the president,â Senators <strong>Dick Durbin,</strong> <strong>Patrick Leahy,</strong> and <strong>Brian Schatz</strong> said in a joint statement this week. âThis madness will not stop until more of our Republican colleagues are willing to put the military ahead of party politics.â</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>The Commerce Department has a report ready to go justifying slapping tariffs on all foreign cars</strong></p>\n<p>But it wonât let anyone see it as officials race to convince â<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/trump-tariff-man-china-trade.html\">Tariff Man</a>â that the levies, which could reach as high as 25 percent, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/20/trump-tariffs-automobiles-commerce-1228344\">are a terrible idea</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Trumpâs senior economic advisers are almost universally opposed to slapping new tariffs on auto imports, warning of dire economic and political consequences. They argue that the tariffs would infuriate close U.S. allies from Asia to Western Europe. German Chancellor <strong>Angela Merkel</strong> said last month that the idea German cars threaten the U.S. would be âa shock.â The move could also undermine efforts to persuade Congress to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even some Trump advisers who have backed other Trump tariffs are wary this time. U.S. Trade Representative <strong>Robert Lighthizer</strong>&#8212;who has frequently sided with Trumpâs more protectionist advisers&#8212;has privately raised concerns about imposing the auto tariffs, according to two senior administration officials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, Trump has until May to make a decision, and itâs not out of the realm of possibility that he could get riled up by something he read on Twitter, ignore his staff, and go nuclear. (As Politico notes, <strong>Peter Navarro,</strong> the economic adviser <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/759559/how-jared-kushner-amazon-search-led-looming-trade-war\">__Jared Kushner found on Amazon</a>, is in favor of the auto tariffs, and has âother officials concerned that Trump might ignore the advice of his other aides and order the tariffs.â) Strangely, parties that would be majorly affected in the event the administration does choose to use the dubious ânational securityâ argument to justify the punitive measures, arenât thrilled about being left in the dark. âThis is a major policy decision that would have a significant impact on an industry that employs directly and indirectly 10 million Americans. If in fact this report is a secret plan to tax hard-working Americans, we ought to know about it. Itâs as simple as that,â <strong>John Bozzella,</strong> the president and C.E.O. of Global Automakers Group and a former Chrysler executive, told Politico. <strong>Jennifer Thomas,</strong> vice president of federal government affairs at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, estimated that a 25 percent tariff would raise the price of foreign cars anywhere from $2,000 to $7,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Jared Kushnerâs father: next time you write about my son, be sure to mention what a kick-ass real-estate investor he is</strong></p>\n<p>Hey, media: <strong>Charles Kushner</strong> has had it with your unfair characterizations of his son, like the one about him being a crappy businessman who made a <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/03/news/companies/kushner-666-fifth-avenue-brookfield/index.html\">historically terrible investment</a> that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/qatar-666-5th-ave-jared-kushner\">Qatar just happened to bail him out of last summer</a>. You be nice to Jared or his dad will have no other choice but to write a follow-up to todayâs op-ed in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-kushner-heres-the-truth-about-my-family-and-our-business/2019/03/20/7e56f49a-4b2e-11e9-b79a-961983b7e0cd_story.html?utm_term=.4c8cc8b3cb44\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>! Sayeth Papa Kush:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Critics of our 666 Fifth Ave. purchase often focus their attacks on my son Jared Kushner, who became chief executive in 2008. That criticism is also baseless. You wouldnât know it from the way his nine-year stewardship of the company has been portrayed, but before he resigned to join the Trump administration in 2017, Jared led major property acquisitions worth more than $5 billion, and the company grew from about 50âemployees to more than 700. We now have more than $7 billion of assets under management.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Charles would also like to point out that Jared, who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/jared-kushner-saudi-arabia-mbs-meeting\">pals around with murderous dictators</a> and only received top-secret security clearance because his father-in-law <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/jared-kushner-security-clearance\">demanded it</a>, is pretty much the most ethical guy youâll ever meet, and left more money on the table to serve his country than you sad sacks will make in your entire lives.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When he left the company, Jared took several steps to preclude conflicts of interest. At the recommendation of his legal counsel, in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics, he divested from more than 80 partnerships, including 666 Fifth Ave., at a substantial financial sacrifice. We walled off Jared from receiving information on the company, and he resigned as the controlling partner in more than 100 entities. This was all done out of an abundance of caution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Caution. Sacrifice. These are the words that are to be used in conjunction with Charlieâs son, while âcompromised,â âincompetent,â and âborn on home plate and thinks he knocked it out of the parkâ are <em>banned.</em> If youâd like, feel free to send any first drafts of articles concerning Jared to the Kushner Cos.â offices, and Chuck will be happy to edit them in advance of publication.</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>UBS Says First Quarter Was âOne of the Worstâ in Recent History (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-20/ubs-says-first-quarter-was-one-of-the-worst-in-recent-history\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Disney Closes $71.3 Billion Deal for 21st Century Fox Assets (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-completes-buy-of-foxs-entertainment-assets-11553074200\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>How <strong>Elizabeth Holmes</strong> fooled everyone about Theranos for so long (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/20/hbos-the-inventor-how-elizabeth-holmes-fooled-people-about-theranos.html\">CNBC</a>)</p>\n<p>Is $430 Million All Itâs Cracked Up to Be?

To date, though, only one person who actively disparages <strong>Donald Trump</strong> online also has the distinction of being married to one of his most prominent White House employees: <strong>George Conway,</strong> husband to presidential adviser <strong>Kellyanne.</strong> Unlike his wife, Conway is known for questioning the presidentâs competence and mental state, a habit he continued over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/george-kellyanne-conway-twitter-feud\">tweeting</a> screenshots from the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder</em>, including an entry for Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and warning that âall Americans should be thinking seriously <em>now</em> about Trumpâs mental condition and psychological state, including and especially the media, Congress&#8212;and the Vice President and Cabinet.â According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-total-loser-trump-lashes-out-at-george-conway-who-has-been-questioning-his-mental-health/2019/03/19/c81bcec0-4a43-11e9-93d0-64dbcf38ba41_story.html?utm_term=.9086738c1d4a\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Trump has âwanted to attack George Conway on Twitter beforeâ but was talked down by aides. This time, he couldnât resist. Georgeâs tweets didnât sit right with the president, and on Tuesday he responded <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=loser%20from%3Arealdonaldtrump&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">the only way he knows how</a>.</p>\n<p>âA total loser!â Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1107983725034463232\">tweeted</a>, re-tweeting a claim by his 2020 campaign manager, <strong>Brad Parscale,</strong> that the president âdoesnât even knowâ his senior adviserâs husband, and that the only reason Conway attacks Trump is out of bitterness over losing out on a job and jealousy of his wifeâs success. Unfortunately, like so many statements that come out of Trumpâs mouth, this one <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-total-loser-trump-lashes-out-at-george-conway-who-has-been-questioning-his-mental-health/2019/03/19/c81bcec0-4a43-11e9-93d0-64dbcf38ba41_story.html\">doesnât hold up in the face of reality</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>George Conway said in an interview with <em>The Washington Post</em> Tuesday that he has had a number of notable interactions with Trump over the past decade, often concerning legal representation and sensitive legal matters since Trump became president. He described the president as âmendaciousâ and âincompetentâ and predicted he would not win reelection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conway said that contrary to Parscaleâs tweet, he opted against working at the Justice Department after Trump offered him a position heading the civil division because he watched Trump attack the departmentâs leaders and then fire <strong>James B. Comey,</strong> the F.B.I. director, in early 2017. Conway said he remembered riding down the West Side Highway in Manhattan and hearing on the radio that special counsel <strong>Robert S. Mueller III</strong> had been appointed to lead an investigation of possible connections between Russian election interference and the Trump campaign. âIâm thinking to myself, this guy is going to be at war with the Justice Department for the next two years,â Conway said. âIâm not doing this.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Conway told the <em>Post</em>, heâs met Trump on numerous occasions, including instances in which the president has asked him for legal advice, or for his opinion on various potential legal hires. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shortly after they were married in 2001, Kellyanne and George Conway moved into an apartment in Manhattanâs Trump World Tower. A few years later, George Conway made an impression on the future president at a condominium board meeting where he argued against removing Trumpâs name from the building. The speech earned him an offer to join the condo board, which he declined but passed on to his wife, who accepted. In a 2006 letter shared with The Washington Post, Trump praised Conway for helping him keep control of the building.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for the assertion that George is jealous of Kellyanne, Conway told the <em>Post</em> he is âproudâ of his wifeâs ability to get this stain on U.S. history elected, and harbors no envy, though he wishes she didnât work in the White House. The senior adviser to the president, however, apparently feels otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kellyanne Conway went on a lengthy rant about her husband to several guests at a British Embassy party for members of Congress last month, including New York Times columnist <strong>Maureen Dowd,</strong> NBC anchor <strong>Andrea Mitchell,</strong> and former Post journalist <strong>Sally Quinn,</strong> according to two attendees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conway told the group that she and the president think her husband is jealous of her, and that the president has kept her at a prominent place in the administration because he trusts her and wants to âprotect her,â the attendees said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the greatest marriage counselors on earth probably couldnât unpack the psychosexual drama that is the Conway union, according to George, his tweets attacking his wifeâs boss arenât a slight against her, as <strong>Eric Trump</strong> has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1069765937568628736\">suggested</a>, but <em>for</em> her. âThe tweeting is just the way to get it out of the way, so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day,â he told the <em>Post</em> âThatâs basically it. Frankly, itâs so I donât end up screaming at her about it.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What does âelite universityâ even mean?

including and especially the media, Congress&#8212;and the Vice President and Cabinet.â And on Wednesday, the president did his best to prove Conwayâs point, re: him being clinically insane.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/donald-trump-george-conway-kellyanne-conway-loser\">calling</a> the conservative attorney âa total loser!â the day prior,

Did Conway and Trump collude to <em>disappear</em> Georgeâs rÃ©sumÃ©?

103,â i.e. the <a href=\"https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/dec-21-1988-pan-am-flight-103-crashes-over-lockerbie-scotland/\">transatlantic flight</a> that was bombed by a terrorist in 1988, killing all 259 passengers on board and 11 on the ground when large part of the aircraft landed on residential areas of Lockerbie, Scotland. (âHereâs a reference these Scots will understand,â he presumably thought to himself.) Returning to his avian anxieties, the noted animal-rights activist <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/trump-coal-plan-will-kill-1400-americans-a-year\">told</a> a West Virginia crowd last summer, âYou look underneath some of those windmills, itâs like a killing field [for] birds.â</p>\n<p>His concerns, it seems, arenât limited to wildlife. âIf Hillary got in. . . youâd be doing wind. Windmills. Weee,â he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/436408-trump-on-wind-energy-i-know-a-lot-about-wind\">told the crowd</a> at a rally in Michigan last week during an aside that, were he not president, would be submitted as evidence to have him committed. âIf it doesnât blow, you can forget about television for that night. âDarling, I want to watch television.â âIâm sorry! The wind isnât blowing.â I know a lot about wind.â So, really, it was only a matter of time before <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-claims-wind-turbines-cause-cancer-reigniting-long-feud-2019-4\">this happened</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>President Donald Trump on Tuesday launched his latest wild attack on wind turbines, an energy source that has long attracted his ire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âThey say the noise causes cancer,â the president remarked of the turbines at the National Republican Congressional Committee fund-raiser in Washington, D.C. âIf you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations&#8212;your house just went down 75 percent in value.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As virtually everyone on the Internet was quick to point out, out here, on planet Earth, cancer is not caused by noise, wind-induced or otherwise. Meanwhile, an energy source that <em>does</em> tend to cause health issues, as <em>New York</em>âs <strong>Jonathan Chait</strong> <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/trump-says-wind-turbine-noise-causes-cancer-it-does-not.html\">notes</a>, âis coal, an extremely dirty fuel Trump loves and has attempted to bolster, with almost no success. Aside from costing more to produce than other sources of power, and in addition to enormous air-pollution side effects, coal also emits greenhouse gases in large amounts.â</p>\n<p>âWind turbines cause cancerâ isnât the first piece of medical advice Dr. Trump has dispensed to his followers. In April 2012, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/194493341302394880\">tweeted</a> a story claiming that âpeople who live up to 2 miles away from the turbines develop such things as sleep, stress and mood disorders once wind farms go up.â (More likely, experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/15/windfarm-sickness-spread-word-australia\">say</a>, the symptoms are psychosomatic.) That same year, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/258593090107998208?lang=en\">warned</a> that L.E.D. light bulbs cause cancer, and that one must âbe careful,â because âthe idiots who came up with this stuff donât care.â Meanwhile, he believes fracking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/329676026382790656\">poses</a> âZERO health risksâ and is, in fact, good for you.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why is Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/why-donald-trump-is-obsessed-with-orourke?inline\">obsessed with Beto OâRourke?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/the-boeing-tragedy-is-just-the-beginning-of-the-self-driving-techpocalypse?inline\">self-driving techpocalypse:</a> the Boeing tragedy is just the beginning</p>\n<p>&#8212; Inside the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/inside-hollywoods-disney-fox-freakout?inline\">Disney-Fox Freakout</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-vs-biden?inline\">Beto vs. Biden:</a> who is Obamaâs true heir apparent?</p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story?inline\">Cover story:</a> Riding around with Beto OâRourke as he comes to grips with a presidential run</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Theories","socialTitle":"Certified Moron Donald Trump Thinks Wind Turbines âCause Cancerâ","socialDescription":"Trump, who once likened wind turbines to the Lockerbie bombing, has a new conspiracy theory.","seoTitle":"Certified Moron Donald Trump Thinks Wind Turbines âCause Cancerâ","seoDescription":"Trump, who once likened wind turbines to the Lockerbie bombing, has a new conspiracy theory.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Business","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"âCome on people!

the electoral college and electing the president based on the popular vote.","body":"<p>Democrats are getting sick of losing. More specifically, Democratic candidates are beginning to ask why, in two of the last five presidential elections, they won the popular vote but lost the White House. In 2000, <strong>Al Gore</strong> edged out <strong>George W. Bush,</strong> but we still got Abu Ghraib and <strong>Harriet Miers</strong> and Katrina and the Iraq War. <strong>Hillary Clintonâs</strong> margin over <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was even larger&#8212;close to 3 million votes&#8212;but Trump won the electoral college, 304 to 227. He has since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/treyyingst/status/862669407868391424?lang=en\">hung the final 2016 electoral map</a> in the West Wing, commemorating his victory. No wonder, then, that a growing number of Democratic presidential candidates are circling a proposal to ditch the electoral college entirely.</p>\n<p>At least four Democratic presidential candidates&#8212;<strong>Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris,</strong> and <strong>Beto OâRourke</strong>&#8212;have either called for or signaled that they are open to eliminating the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. Buttigieg and Warren have been the most direct. In January, the South Bend mayor <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/indiana-mayor-pete-buttigieg-touts-more-experience-in-government-than-trump/\">said</a> that the electoral college has made our society âless and less Democratic.â âWeâve got to repair our democracy,â Buttigieg said on <em>CBS This Morning.</em> âThe electoral college needs to go.â Senator Warren took up the call <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l-254XnpkA\">this week</a>, making her own pitch during a CNN town-hall Monday. âMy view is that every vote matters,â Warren said to applause from the Mississippi crowd. âThe way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the electoral college&#8212;and every vote counts.â</p>\n<p>Harris and OâRourke, both of whom are seen as top-tier Democratic candidates, didnât directly endorse abolishing the electoral college, but nevertheless seem open to such a measure. âI think thereâs a lot of wisdom in that,â OâRourke told MSNBC on Tuesday, citing Clintonâs large popular-vote victory over Trump, and the fact that it âputs some states out of play altogether.â âIâm open to the discussion,â Harris <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B65bZOOH2BI\">said</a> in an appearance Tuesday on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> âThereâs no question that the popular vote has been diminished, in terms of making the final decision about whoâs the president of the United States, and we need to deal with that. So Iâm open to the discussion.â</p>\n<p>Itâs exceedingly unlikely that any such change could be made in the near future, let alone before 2020. Ending the electoral college would require amending the U.S. Constitution, necessitating either a super-majority of both houses of Congress or a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of state legislatures. Still, thereâs plenty of backing for the idea. A <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/20/politics/popular-vote-poll/index.html\">poll</a> last year found that a majority of Americans support âamendingâ the Constitution to elect the president by popular vote. (Interestingly, the outcome flipped when pollsters inquired about âchangingâ the Constitution, suggesting that respondents are sensitive to the wording regarding the process.)</p>\n<p>The growing drumbeat on the left has caught the attention of the president, who railed against the idea in a late-night tweetstorm this week, despite having previously called the electoral college a âdisaster for a democracyâ as recently as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/266038556504494082\">2012</a>. âCampaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier &amp; different than campaigning for the Electoral College,â Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1108187855954870272\">wrote</a> on Tuesday. âItâs like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to just the large States - the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States &amp; the entire Midwest would end up losing all power - &amp; we canât let that happen.â</p>\n<p>âI used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.,â he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108190837257764864\">added</a>.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason for his change of heart is likely his loss of the popular vote in 2016, something he has falsely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/802972944532209664?lang=en\">ascribed</a> to millions of illegal votes being cast for his Democratic opponent, but also the fact that the electoral college tends to favor Republicans. As PolitiFact <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/17/donald-trump/donald-trumps-questionable-claim-electoral-college/\">noted</a> last year, states with small populations&#8212;which tend to be red-leaning&#8212;have a âdisproportionatelyâ large voice in the electoral college, and the swing states necessary to win have larger-than-average populations of non-college-educated whites, who make up a significant portion of Trumpâs base, as polling guru <strong>Nate Silver</strong> <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-electoral-college-blind-spot/\">observed</a> in 2017.</p>\n<p>There have been any number of high-profile pushes to switch over to a popular vote. As <strong>Jesse Wegman</strong> pointed out in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/opinion/birch-bayh-constitution.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> last week, no other part of the Constitution has been targeted more often for reform or removal. The Democratic rumblings this week to amend the electoral college came days after former senator Birch Bayh, who led perhaps the most viable campaign to kill the electoral college, died. His effort to abolish the college in 1968, Wegman wrote Thursday, earned the bipartisan backing of 80 percent of Americans, and in 1969 passed the House and gained the support of then-President Richard Nixon, before being shot down in the Senate by Southern segregationists, who saw the electoral college as key to their political power. Some <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/20/politics/popular-vote-poll/index.html\">polling</a> suggests that Americansâ support for electing the president through a popular vote alone is on the rise&#8212;but itâs nowhere near the overwhelming bipartisan majority that seemed to support the idea 50 years ago, and itâs unclear how much political will there is to actually move the needle.</p>\n<p>But a number of states are already taking action, with several signing on to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, wherein a group of Democratic states and Washington, D.C., have agreed to award their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote overall&#8212;supposing enough states join to hit the magic number of 270 electoral votes. California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and D.C. had already joined. Colorado on Friday <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/colorado-joins-effort-to-elect-presidents-by-popular-vote-skip-electoral-college\">became</a> the latest state, and the first swing state, to join the pact, bringing the groupâs total number of electoral votes to 181. Delaware, with its 3 electoral votes, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/434545-delaware-house-passes-bill-to-give-states-electoral-college-votes-to\">passed</a> a measure through its state house last week to join up.</p>\n<p>Itâs unlikely to have any impact on the 2020 election, but with growing buzz among Democratic candidates, it could become a campaign issue for those vying to challenge Trump, who has implied they are trying to steal the upcoming election. âThe Democrats are getting very âstrange,ââ he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1108217768187449344\">said</a> in a tweet late Tuesday. âActually, youâve got to win it at the Ballot Box!â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What does âelite universityâ even mean?

According to his own advisers, that ainât gonna happen.","body":"<p>When <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was running for office, he regularly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/29/donald-trump-keeps-moving-the-goal-post-for-economic-growth/\">claimed</a> he would preside over a rate of âtremendousâ economic growth as high as 6 percent. When he actually became president, that goalpost moved to 3 percent annually. Now, as he gears up for reelection, heâll undoubtedly tell supporters that the skyâs the limit, and hey, 6, 7, or even 8 percent might be possible. Yet one group of people is cautioning that even expectations of 3 percent a year for the next decade wonât be achievable without a long list of legislation that has little chance of actually happening: his own economic advisers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To achieve the higher growth rate, the White House assumes that the individual tax cuts will be made permanent (theyâre currently slated to expire after 2025) and that Congress will pass an infrastructure bill âcommencing in 2019 with observable effects beginning in 2020,â the report says. While thereâs widespread agreement that the United States needs a major infrastructure upgrade, thereâs a big gap between the Democratic and Republican visions of what to do. . .The 3 percent White House growth prediction . . . also assumes more deregulation, especially in the finance industry, and a push for âimproving self-sufficiencyâ by placing more work requirements on recipients of government aid. Some of those initiatives might be possible to implement through executive action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Growth would be about 2.5 percent in 2022 if no additional policies are implemented, according to White House calculations. By 2026, growth could fall to about 2 percent, the model suggests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though Trump <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan-with-no-tax-hike-2016-10\">claimed</a> during the 2016 election that he would spend $1 trillion on infrastructure, so far all weâve gotten has been a series of âInfrastructure Week(s)â that consisted of little more than light  <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-caps-infrastructure-week-tossing-binders-ground-n770376\">prop comedy</a>. (Meanwhile, the budget he proposed last month would cut infrastructure spending.) And while Trump may be able to act unilaterally in some areas, like work-requirements, in others heâll almost certainly need Democratic support.</p>\n<p>National Economic Council chair <strong>Kevin Hassett</strong>&#8212;who <em>wrote</em> the report noting that a perfect storm would have to occur for Trumpâs predicted growth to pan out&#8212;insists anyone doubting the president is nothing more than a naysayer, noting that predictions for 2017 and 2018 were nearly dead on. âEveryone said we wouldnât get 3.1 percent,â Hassett said. âWeâre relying on the same analysis because nothing has come up which suggests to us itâs not going to happen.â</p>\n<p>Economists, however, believe Trumpâs economy is nothing more than a giant tax cut-induced sugar high that will ultimately fade. âWeâve always said 3 percent growth for one year was possible after we gave the economy a lot of stimulus. But you canât keep giving the economy more stimulus every year,â <strong>Marc Goldwein,</strong> senior policy director at a Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told <em>The Washington Post.</em> âThereâs nobody that thinks weâre going to be anywhere close to 3 percent growth a year over the next decade.â</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Donald Trump Jr: Brexit would have gone swimmingly if Theresa May had listened to my dad</strong></p>\n<p>Hereâs <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-jr-brexit-election-comparison/\">a take</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Writing in the Telegraph, Trump Jr. said British Prime Minister Theresa May has âpromised on more than 50 separate occasions that Britain would leave the EU on March 29 2019. She needs to honour that promise.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âBut Mrs May ignored advice from my father, and ultimately, a process that should have taken only a few short months has become a years-long stalemate, leaving the British people in limbo.â Trump Jr., whose net worth is reputed to be $200 million and who is executive vice president of his father&#39;s business empire, also said that âelites control London from Brusselsâ and that with the Brexit deadline fast approaching, âit appears that democracy in the UK is all but dead.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the the guy who <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/snl-donald-trump-jr-tweet.html\">thought</a> the âNâ in S.N.L. stood for âand,â Brexit âis an example of how the establishment elites try to subvert the will of the people when theyâre given the chance.â Perhaps Parliament should fly in the second generation of the Trump Brain Trust to help them out over these next couple weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>How are those China negotiations working out?</strong></p>\n<p>Good, great, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-19/some-u-s-officials-said-to-see-china-walking-back-trade-pledges?\">nothing to see here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some U.S. negotiators are concerned that China is pushing back against American demands in trade talks, according to people familiar with the negotiations, even as President Donald Trump sounded optimistic about reaching a deal that could boost his reelection chances. Chinese officials have shifted their stance because after agreeing to changes to their intellectual-property policies, they havenât received assurances from the Trump administration that tariffs imposed on their exports would be lifted, two of the people said on condition of anonymity. Beijing has also stepped back from its initial promises over data protection of pharmaceuticals, didnât offer details on plans to improve patent linkages, and refused to give ground on data-service issues, one person familiar with the U.S.âs views said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, on Planet Trump:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaylatausche/status/1108070624839286785\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaylatausche/status/1108070624839286785\">https://twitter.com/kaylatausche/status/1108070624839286785</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Criminal Past Haunts Surviving Founder of Troubled Crypto Exchange (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-19/from-fraud-to-fintech-quadriga-co-founder-s-past-crimes-emerge\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Tie Guy Is Breakout Star of the <strong>Elizabeth Holmes</strong> Documentary (<a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/bitcoin-tie-theranos-documentary.html\">NYM</a>)</p>\n<p>Kushnerâs Peace Plan Includes âLand Swapsâ With Saudi Arabia, Book Claims (<a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Kushners-peace-plan-includes-land-swaps-with-Saudi-Arabia-book-claims-583932\">Jerusalem Post</a>)</p>\n<p>19 blacked-out pages of Cohen search warrant suggest legal peril for Trump (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/19/cohen-search-warrant-19-blacked-out-pages-suggest-trump-legal-peril.html\">CNBC</a>)</p>\n<p>Transportation Department seeks audit of FAAâs certification of Boeing 737 Max 8 (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/19/transportation-secretary-asks-departments-inspector-general-to-audit-faas-certification-of-boeing-737-max.html\">CNBC</a>)</p>\n<p>Buy Gold, Sell Stocks Is the âTrade of Centuryâ Says One Hedge Fund (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-19/top-hedge-fund-says-buy-gold-sell-stocks-in-trade-of-century?srnd=premium\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Elon Muskâs</strong> defense of his Tesla tweets âborders on the ridiculous,â SEC says (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/19/elon-musks-defense-his-tesla-tweets-is-flawed-sec-says/\">Washington Post</a>)</p>\n<p>Prosecutors reportedly offer deal to drop prostitution solicitation charges against New England Patriots owner <strong>Robert Kraft</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/19/prosecutors-offer-to-drop-prostitution-charges-against-robert-kraft.html\">CNBC</a>)</p>\n<p>Trump picks ex-Delta executive <strong>Steve Dickson</strong> to lead FAA amid Boeing 737 Max crisis (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/19/white-house-expected-to-pick-steve-dickson-as-permanent-faa-head-wsj-citing-sources.html\">CNBC</a>)</p>\n<p>Racing pigeon sells for record $1.4 million (<a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2019/03/19/Racing-pigeon-sells-for-record-14-million/3171553006237/\">UPI</a>)</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What does âelite universityâ even mean?

<strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> longtime golf caddie, would things like mild-mannered, reasonable, or housebroken be on the list? Of course they wouldnât. Weâre talking about a guy who prizes loyalty above all else, who flies off the handle at the slightest provocation&#8212;real or imagined&#8212;and who surrounds himself with <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/paul-manafort-ny-indictment\">criminals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/kushner-cos-subpoenaed-over-slumlordesque-tactics\">slumlords</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/donald-trump-bob-kraft-white-house\">massage parlor enthusiasts</a>, and at least one guy whoâs said he would do âanythingâ for him, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/28/matthew-calamari-went-viral-after-cohen-hearing-hes-real-he-loves-trump/?utm_term=.5afb4c8efe8d\">including kill a man</a>. So, really, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/21/donald-trump-golf-caddy-225885\">this all checks out</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A.J.</strong> (who asked that I not use his last name in my book) is so loyal that if someone criticizes Trump, heâll fight him&#8212;and has. One day, when the 2017 Senior PGA Championship was being held at Trump Washington, he overhead one of the Tour proâs caddies&#8212;<strong>Brian âSullyâ Sullivan</strong>&#8212;dissing Trump.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âHe was running his mouth, sir,â says A.J., who calls everybody âsirâ or âmaâam.â âYellinâ about Mr. Trump. He was sayinâ to somebody, âDonât tell me how I have to feel about him! I hate that motherf-----!ââ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A.J. says he came up on Sully from behind and put him in a full military choke hold, yelling, âNow, you listen to me, f-----! Youâre not gonna come to Mr. Trumpâs course and eat Mr. Trumpâs food and then use the word âhateâ about my president. I wonât have it, you got me?â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A.J.âs intolerance for people running their mouths about the president is not confined to fellow caddies. Hereâs another fun story he told sportswriter <strong>Rick Reilly,</strong> for the forthcoming book, <em>Commander-in-Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump,</em> about having to deal with people disrespecting his man:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tensions were high because, for seniors, it was a big tournament and Trumpâs name was attached to it. There were protesters by the entrance every day that week, and A.J. always made sure to drive his car right by them. âThereâd be a bunch a women out front with all their stupid signs, sir. So I go real slow by âem, see, hit the window button&#8212;zzzzzzttt&#8212;toss âem the bird and I yell, âF--- you!â Theyâd start yelling at me and Iâm like&#8212;zzzztttt&#8212;right back up. And I laughed, sir.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If loving Trump so much that he has to tell people to go f--k themselves and/or assault them to set them straight is wrong, well, sorry. A.J. doesnât want to be right.</p>","rubric":"Personnel","socialTitle":"Of Course Trumpâs Golf Caddie Is a Violently Overprotective Sociopath","socialDescription":"âListen to me, f--ker!â Meet

The most obvious one has been staring us in the face all along.","body":"<p>Attorney General <strong>William Barrâs</strong> summary of special counsel <strong>Robert Muellerâs</strong> conclusions, in the fancy language of lawyers, impeaches itself. That means that its own words and reasoning call some of Barrâs conclusions into doubt, particularly Barrâs eagerness to say that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> canât be proven to have obstructed justice.</p>\n<p>It is hard for any of us to know how much credence to give Barrâs prÃ©cis of the Mueller investigation without knowing more about the evidence. Barrâs letter, however, acknowledges that much and pledges to work to disclose as much as he can without violating Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which bars making public grand jury proceedings. But the attorney generalâs eagerness to clear Trump of possible obstruction of justice, after having the report in hand for less than 48 hours, is unbecoming of his office and Muellerâs two-year investigation. Furthermore, some of the reasoning in his letter is clearly deeply flawed.</p>\n<p>In particular, Barrâs conclusion that obstruction canât be proven beyond a reasonable doubt involves bootstrapping that is utter nonsense in this case. Barr&#8212;just like Trumpâs lawyer <strong>Rudy Giuliani</strong>&#8212;claims that ordinarily obstruction requires a nexus to an underlying crime. Because Mueller found the evidence insufficient to prove that Trump actively conspired with the Russians to interfere with the election, traditional legal reasoning would say heâs not likely to have committed obstruction either. Barr says, âGenerally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding.â</p>\n<p>This sounds like arcane legal stuff, but itâs actually a matter of common sense. In judging whether a suspect had a corrupt intent to obstruct justice, a reasonable prosecutor would look at the potential gain to the defendant by engaging in the questionable behavior. In most cases, if the target didnât commit an underlying offense, he would have no reason to hinder the investigation.</p>\n<p>But that is not true in Trumpâs case. Throughout his election campaign and long after, Trump denied that Russia was responsible for the massive interference in our election that Mueller has now concluded occurred. Trump made these denials âdespite,â to quote Barr, âmultiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.â Aside from any crimes Trump or his campaign committed by being in cahoots with the Russians, there are other clear gains to Trump in hindering the investigation. The most obvious is that the Russian interference, which both Barr and Mueller say the Trump campaign knew about, calls the legitimacy of the 2016 election into question.</p>\n<p>With our focus on whether the president is going to jail, we have run past a point that is now undeniable: Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States after a sustained series of crimes by the Russian government aimed at boosting his chances of winning. Because of the political damage to the president that Russiaâs criminal interference posed, he had an obvious reason to terminate the investigation. In other words, he had something to hide, and the Mueller inquiry seems to have concluded that there was plenty of evidence that he hid it.</p>\n<p>To argue that no underlying crime means no obstruction is therefore nonsense. That is fallacious reasoning and it impugns Barrâs integrity and his reputation as a lawyer. Worse, it represents a troubling effort to paper over the acknowledged evidence that Mr. Trump committed a crime in public view.</p>\n<p><em>Scott Turow, a Vanity Fair contributor, attorney, and best-selling author, is the author of</em> Presumed Innocent, The Burden of Proof, Ordinary Heroes, Identical, <em>and</em> Testimony.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why is Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/why-donald-trump-is-obsessed-with-orourke?inline\">obsessed with Beto OâRourke?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/the-boeing-tragedy-is-just-the-beginning-of-the-self-driving-techpocalypse?inline\">self-driving techpocalypse:</a> the Boeing tragedy is just the beginning</p>\n<p>&#8212; Inside the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/inside-hollywoods-disney-fox-freakout?inline\">Disney-Fox Freakout</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-vs-biden?inline\">Beto vs. Biden:</a> who is Obamaâs true heir apparent?</p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story?inline\">Cover story:</a> Riding around with Beto OâRourke as he comes to grips with a presidential run</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Mueller Report","socialTitle":"âA Crime in Public Viewâ: How William Barr Pardoned Donald Trump","socialDescription":"Trump had plenty of reasons to obstruct Muellerâs investigation, whether or not there was an underlying crime.

whoppers he told to get $2 billion from Deutsche Bank.","body":"<p>One of the great mysteries of the business world is why Deutsche Bank lent financial pariah <strong>Donald Trump</strong> $2 billion over two decades, when other firms treated him like an infectious disease capable of wiping out entire populations. Thanks to Democratsâ newly obtained subpoena power, the answer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/business/trump-deutsche-bank.html\">may be revealed</a> through the âextensive internal documents and communications about Mr. Trumpâ the bank is expected to start handing over to congressional committees next month. In the meantime, however, a report from <em>The New York Times</em> about the presidentâs relationship with the German lender has shed some light on the matter. For one, Deutsche had a âravenous appetite for risk,â including the risk of doing business with a guy whose name was synonymous in some quarters with bankruptcy. As a result, reporter <strong>David Enrich</strong> writes, bank executives were happy not only to ignore repeated, glaring red flags, but to go along with Trumpâs cornucopia of financial lies.</p>\n<p>Enrich brings the receipts. In 2004, shortly after Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts defaulted on hundreds of millions of bonds, causing steep losses for Deutsche clients, Trump asked the bankâs commercial real-estate group to lend him more than $500 million to build a 92-story skyscraper in Chicago. It did, but not before employees determined, among other things, that Trump was massively inflating his assets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Trump told Deutsche Bank his net worth was about $3 billion, but when bank employees reviewed his finances, they concluded he was worth about $788 million, according to documents produced during a lawsuit Mr. Trump brought against the former <em>New York Times</em> journalist <strong>Timothy OâBrien.</strong> And a senior investment-banking executive said in an interview that he and others cautioned that Mr. Trump should be avoided because he had worked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/d7b621dd-7240-4e6f-883f-42f814ab19d6\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/d7b621dd-7240-4e6f-883f-42f814ab19d6\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

And donât forget to subscribe.</em></strong></p>\n<p>In patented Trump fashion, shortly before the bulk of the loan was due in November 2008, he sued the bank to get out of repaying, demanding $3 billion in damages and arguing that Deutsche had, in part, caused the financial crisis and was therefore to blame for his inability to sell hundreds of condo units. The firm countersued, and investment-banking executives severed ties with the real-estate developer. However, other divisions of the company were more than happy to go back for more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shortly after the Chicago lawsuit was settled, <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> was told that Mr. Trump was looking for a loan and introduced him to [private banker] <strong>Rosemary Vrablic,</strong> according to people familiar with the relationship.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Trump flew Ms. Vrablic to Miami to show her a property he wanted to buy: the Doral Golf Resort and Spa. He needed more than $100 million for the 72-hole property. Deutsche Bank dispatched a team to Trump Tower to inspect Mr. Trumpâs personal and corporate financial records. The bankers determined he was overvaluing some of his real-estate assets by as much as 70 percent, according to two former executives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But hey, whatâs a few wildly inflated assets among friends? And speaking of friends, if Deutsche <em>really</em> wanted to show it was Trumpâs friend . . .</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Trump also expressed interest in another loan from the private-banking division: $48 million for the same Chicago property that had provoked the two-year court fight. Mr. Trump told the bank he would use that loan to repay what he still owed the investment-banking division, the two former executives said. Even by Wall Street standards, borrowing money from one part of a bank to pay off a loan from another was an extraordinary act of financial chutzpah. . . . A powerful committee in Frankfurt, which evaluated loans based on risks to the bankâs reputation, signed off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By 2014, according to the <em>Times,</em> Deutsche was not only happy to go along with Trumpâs alternative truths about his assets, but helped to aid and abet them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In early 2014, Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> approached Ms. Vrablic about more potential loans. The owner of the Buffalo Bills had died, and the N.F.L. franchise was up for sale. Mr. Trump was interested, and he needed to show the league he had the financial wherewithal to pull off a transaction that could top $1 billion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Trump asked Ms. Vrablic if the bank would be willing to make a loan and handed over bare-bones financial statements that estimated his net worth at $8.7 billion. Mr. Cohen testified to Congress last month that the documents exaggerated Mr. Trumpâs wealth. Deutsche Bank executives had reached a similar conclusion. They nonetheless agreed to vouch for Mr. Trumpâs bid, according to an executive involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trumpâs bid did not win, but shortly thereafter, the bank lent him $170 million to renovate the Old Post Office building that would become the Trump International Hotel Washington, where foreign governments and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/t-mobile-acknowledges-its-patronage-of-trumps-washington-hotel-increased-sharply-after-announcement-of-merger-with-sprint/2019/03/05/d123be66-3ecb-11e9-922c-64d6b7840b82_story.html\">other parties looking to kiss the ring</a> are known to book rooms. Shortly after <em>that,</em> Trump was elected president, and the bank, realizing it had somehow âbecome the biggest lender to the president-elect,â reportedly uttered a collective <em>dear god, what have we done?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A report prepared by the boardâs integrity committee concluded that executives in the private-banking division were so determined to win business from big-name clients that they had ignored Mr. Trumpâs reputation for demagogy and defaults, according to a person who read the report.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The review also found that Deutsche Bank had produced a number of âexposure reportsâ that flagged the growing business with Mr. Trump, but that they had not been adequately reviewed by senior executives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the <em>Times,</em> managers started telling employees not to mention the word âTrumpâ to people outside the bank, out of fear of âstoking public interest in its ties to the new president.â Unfortunately, as the old saying goes, it was <em>a little fucking late for that.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Two years after Mr. Trump was sworn in, Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The chamberâs financial services and intelligence committees opened investigations into Deutsche Bankâs relationship with Mr. Trump. Those inquiries, as well as the New York attorney generalâs investigation, come at a perilous time for Deutsche Bank, which is negotiating to merge with another large German lender.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What does âelite universityâ even mean?

Law","promoHed":"Trump Administration Declares âAll-Out Warâ on Obamaâs Signature Law","dek":"The Department of Justice is supporting a ruling that would invalidate the Affordable Care Act.","promoDek":"The Department of Justice is supporting a ruling that would invalidate the Affordable Care Act.","body":"<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> still has Obamacare in his crosshairs, and now his administration has launched a new effort to torpedo the law. On Monday, Trumpâs Department of Justice threw its weight behind a federal district judgeâs ruling that would invalidate the Affordable Care Act in its totality, a more extreme position than the administration had previously staked out, and one that could prove potentially devastating for Americans who depend on the law. âThe Department of Justice has determined that the district courtâs judgment should be affirmed,â the D.O.J. wrote in a <a href=\"https://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/letter-from-DOJ.pdf\">filing</a> Monday to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is currently considering the case. âThe United States is not urging that any portion of the district courtâs judgment be reversed.â</p>\n<p>Republicans have sought to undermine <strong>Barack Obamaâs</strong> signature health-care policy since its inception nearly 10 years ago, and Trump last year succeeded in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/13/17226566/obamacare-penalty-2018-individual-mandate-still-in-effect\">ending the lawâs individual mandate</a>, a key part of the legislation requiring Americans to either have health insurance or pay a fine. But he and his allies have so far failed to repeal and replace the A.C.A., despite having controlled both the House and Senate for the first two years of Trumpâs presidency. Trump has groused about those high-profile defeats, most notably in his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1107020360803909632\">bizarre, ongoing attacks</a> against late senator John McCain, who shot down the G.O.P.âs half-baked âskinny repealâ with a dramatic, last-minute <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT2pp_KrJGg\">thumbs-down</a>. Trump has also continued to target the A.C.A., <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/trumps-health-care-plan-will-influence-2020-debate/585442/\">proposing</a> in his most recent budget that Obamacare be repealed and replaced with his preferred block-grant system&#8212;a position that will likely figure heavily into the 2020 campaign, but that would almost certainly be a nonstarter in the Democratically controlled House.</p>\n<p>But the D.O.J.âs support for Judge <strong>Reed OâConnorâs</strong> ruling in <em>Texas v. United States</em> could present a legitimate threat to the A.C.A. Texas, banded with other red states that opposed Obamacare, argued that the whole law should be thrown out because the individual mandate had been repealed. California and several blue states have challenged the judgeâs ruling, setting up a battle in the Fifth Circuit, and likely in the Supreme Court down the road. The administrationâs support for the sweeping ruling is a more aggressive position than its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-administration-wont-defend-aca-in-cases-brought-by-gop-states/2018/06/07/92f56e86-6a9c-11e8-9e38-24e693b38637_story.html?utm_term=.e1ccebc93fe8\">previous stance</a>, which held that only some parts of the law, like protections for people with pre-existing conditions, should be eliminated.</p>\n<p>That argument last year by then-Attorney General <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> was a direct and unusual threat by the Justice Department against an existing law. This even more extreme position, under <strong>William Barrâs</strong> D.O.J., not only threatens to leave millions of Americans without health care, but, as Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/25/trump-obamacare-justice-department-1236116\">noted</a>, would upend some of the Trump administrationâs own agenda, such as its proposed drug-price reforms and its battle against opioids. It could also carry political costs for the president. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/kff-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&amp;aRange=twoYear\">Polls</a> suggest that more Americans support the A.C.A. than oppose it. And several Democratic presidential candidates have not only defended Obamacare, but have pledged to expand access to health care.</p>\n<p>Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, have vowed to fight the administrationâs latest âmonstrousâ broadside. âTonight in federal court, the Trump Administration decided not only to try to destroy protections for Americans living with pre-existing conditions, but to declare all-out war on the health care of the American people,â House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> said in a <a href=\"https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/32519-2/\">statement</a> after the D.O.J.âs filing. âDemocrats will continue to fight relentlessly to protect people with pre-existing conditions and to deliver lower health costs and prescription drug prices for every American.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why is Trump <a

But it never got Trump involved!","body":"<p>Over the weekend, Attorney General <strong>William Barr</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/24/18279926/mueller-report-letter-full-text-plain-barr-trump-congress\">submitted</a> a letter to Congress summarizing the findings of <strong>Robert Muellerâs</strong> investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice by <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> his campaign, and his administration. With regard to the latter, the special counsel apparently did not come to a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice, though Barr and Deputy Attorney General <strong>Rod Rosenstein</strong> decided on their own not to charge him. With regard to the former, Mueller did not find any evidence of collusion with Russia. However, the letter <em>does</em> note that Mueller found Russia <em>aggressively</em> attempted to meddle in the election, both through a disinformation campaign âto sow social discordâ and âcomputer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election.â</p>\n<p>In the end, the Kremlin apparently failed to get anyone from the campaign to go along with its efforts, âdespite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.â For the outraged Russian politicians claiming the Kremlin has been vindicated by the investigation, though, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/mueller-report-russia-responds-to-the-mueller-investigation-summary.html\">thatâs a distinction not worth mentioning</a>!</p>\n<p>âFrom the very start it was a biased, artificial, provocative, conspiratorial, designed-to-fuel-hatred towards Trump campaign,â Russian Senator <strong>Alexey Pushkov</strong> tweeted Sunday. âIts second goal was to demonize Russia and prevent any US moves towards better relations with Moscow.â</p>\n<p>âSo, Muellerâs long-awaited report proved what was known in Russia from the very beginning: There was no collusion between Trump and any of his team with the Kremlin,â <strong>Konstantin Kosachev,</strong> a senator in Russiaâs upper house of Parliament, wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, claiming that the administration was forced to come down hard on Russia as a result of the investigation. âTwo years of unceasing lies. Two years of the highest-level policy built on the allegation of collusion. A conspiracy explaining the allegedly pro-Russian position of Trump, because of which he was essentially forced to impose more and more stringent measures against our country. That is why two years were not just lost for Russian-American relations, but simply crushing for them. Someone will answer for this damage? Someone apologize? Someone will adjust something?â</p>\n<p>In a weekly press conference on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong> expressed similar grievances. âWe saw some sort of squeeze, some summary, which does not say anything new&#8212;except for the recognition of the absence of some kind of collusion,â he noted, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/mueller-report-russia-responds-to-the-mueller-investigation-summary.html\">according</a> to CNBC. âIt is difficult to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it is not there.â</p>\n<p>Again, all three of these men seem to be focusing on the fact that Mueller found no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia, rather than his findings that Russia attempted&#8212;many times!&#8212;to get the campaign to collude. Anyway, the Kremlin wants an apology, and it wants one now. And what better way for Uncle Sam to show he cares than by turning the other cheek when it comes to 2020 election meddling that may or may not <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-intel-agencies-russia-china-plotting-interfere-2020-election-n963896\">already be underway</a>?</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why is Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/why-donald-trump-is-obsessed-with-orourke?inline\">obsessed with Beto OâRourke?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/the-boeing-tragedy-is-just-the-beginning-of-the-self-driving-techpocalypse?inline\">self-driving techpocalypse:</a> the Boeing tragedy is just the beginning</p>\n<p>&#8212; Inside the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/inside-hollywoods-disney-fox-freakout?inline\">Disney-Fox Freakout</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-vs-biden?inline\">Beto vs. Biden:</a> who is Obamaâs true heir apparent?</p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story?inline\">Cover story:</a> Riding around with Beto OâRourke as he comes to grips with a presidential run</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Mueller Report","socialTitle":"Russia: How Dare You Drag Trump into Our Crimes","socialDescription":"Sure, the Kremlin attempted to throw the U.S. election.

Not many people can get away with dropping an f-bomb on the chief executive of one of the worldâs most influential investment banks. But not many people are known as the sage of Wall Street and one of the most important figures in modern finance.\n<p>Fink is responsible for building BlackRock into the worldâs largest investment firm, with $4.6 trillion in assets under management. He came to Wall Street with long hair, decked out in turquoise jewelry, as any good California boy would, and ended up as a Wall Street consigliere of sorts, particularly during the financial crisis, when he became the de facto manager of how Washington bailed out Wall Street. He advised the Treasury and Federal Reserve, along with the whole cadre of bank C.E.O.s in over their heads. His equanimity and respect from all sides of the aisle make him a perennial guess as to who will be the next Treasury secretary.</p>\n<p>A move to Washington would upset Finkâs finely honed daily routine, which has him waking up at five, in his car with three newspapers in hand (the contents of which he has mostly read the night before) 45 minutes later, and in his Midtown Manhattan office by six for an hour and a half of free time before his long slog of meetings starts. In his schedule every morning is time to call his wife, Lori, whom he met in high school. Washington is also quite a hike from their 26-acre farm in New Yorkâs North Salem and not an easy trip to their home in Aspen.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574370278c923dbe03a29bad_hive-contributor-profile-larry-fink.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 5:06 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-larry-fink.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-larry-fink.jpg","credit":"By Simon Dawson/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57437027b09823be03ef3d12","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 5:03 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 5:06 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 462001618","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/larry-fink","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574370278c923dbe03a29bad_hive-contributor-profile-larry-fink.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 5:06 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-larry-fink.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-larry-fink.jpg","credit":"By Simon Dawson/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57437027b09823be03ef3d12","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 5:03 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 5:06 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 462001618","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"searchable":true,"expired":false,"revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/larry-fink","distributionChannels":[{"name":"web-owned-and-operated","metadata":{"searchable":true}}],"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revision":3,"entityId":"5739f8adff97be4071974e2e"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Duel of the Mega-Dealers","promoHed":"The Ultimate Art-World Cage Match: Larry Gagosian vs. David Zwirner","dek":"Gallery owners Larry Gagosian and David Zwirner, two of the biggest names in contemporary art, are locked in a high-stakes skirmish to represent the late Austrian artist Franz West.","promoDek":"Mega-dealers Gagosian and Zwirner, two of the biggest names in contemporary art, are locked in a high-stakes skirmish to represent the late Austrian artist Franz West.","body":"<p>Every June they fly in like an air force of contemporary art: the worldâs top dealers and collectors landing in Basel, Switzerland, for the yearâs most significant fair. Of that glittering throng, four figures stand apart. The mega-dealers occupy booths no different from the rest. They just sell a lot more art: not a million dollars here at Art Basel, but tens of millions. Not tens of millions over the course of a year, but hundreds of millions. Or, in the case of Larry Gagosian, $1 billion. If, that is, you believe those numbers: the mega-dealers may boast of a particular sale, but all are private, and they stay mum on profits in what is, notoriously, the worldâs largest unregulated market of legal goods.</p>\n<p>At 48, Swiss-born Iwan Wirth, of Hauser &amp; Wirth, is the youngest of the four. Oldest, at 80, is Arne Glimcher, who opened New York Cityâs Pace Gallery in 1963. Glimcher has notched many of the top sales of the last half-century, and remains a force. But he is openly weary of the global bazaar that contemporary art has become. âThis market has nothing to do with art,â he says. âItâs all about how fast one can make money.â Glimcher has made his son, Marc, 55, his successor, and it is Marc who comes to Basel now, while his father keeps to his small, lamp-lit office on Manhattanâs 57th Street&#8212;the street where contemporary art began.</p>\n<p>The other two Megas&#8212;Gagosian, 73, and David Zwirner, 54&#8212;are the ones most carefully watched at Art Basel. Gagosian, while powerful, is less given to the rages that once defined him. The German-born Zwirner is calmer, more genial. But the two are still so competitive that for all the events they have attended together&#8212;the art fairs and gallery openings and ceaseless art-world parties&#8212;they have never âbroken breadâ with each other, says Zwirner. Not one face-to-face meal or drink, not one cheery chat. Theirs is an art-world cold war that has helped shape the entire marketplace. It is no exaggeration to say that the deals made by this pair of adversaries can alter the fates and fortunes of their numerous allies and challengers.</p>\n<p>All dealers, of course, vie with one another, and tensions rise and fall. But Gagosian and Zwirner have had an especially bitter history, epitomized by their fight over a now deceased, hard-drinking Viennese artist once relatively unknown&#8212;whose estate is now worth more than $50 million. The story of Franz West is the story of how Gagosian and Zwirner became arch-rivals and then, through proxies, became entangled in a seven-year court battle that is only now awaiting a final verdict.</p>\n<p>Some dealers, like Gagosian, start with nothing. Most start with family money and connections. David Zwirner is one of those. His father, Rudolf, was a well-known German dealer and intellectual. David grew up above his fatherâs gallery in Cologne, hanging out with houseguests like Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Cy Twombly.</p>\n<p>David was 10 when his parents divorced; four years later he moved with his father to SoHo. Briefly he nursed dreams of becoming a jazz drummer. He was 28 in 1993 when he opened a gallery of his own, on SoHoâs Greene Street. His timing was propitious: the art-market recession of 1990 was ebbing. Zwirner had no fixed ideas about what he wanted to show. âI didnât care what medium: painters, sculptors, video&#8212;no parameters,â he recalls. âAuthenticity was what I was after.â</p>\n<p>Zwirner knew he would have to build his business in the secondary market: works already sold at least once by artists established or on their way. But discovering new artists&#8212;the primary market&#8212;was what made his heart race. To find new talent, he went to then small European fairs such as Documenta. He came back with, among others, a video artist named Stan Douglas, who made short, noir-ish movies; a figurative painter named Luc Tuymans; and a young, carousing dynamo named Franz West.</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>West was a multi-media artist much admired in Europe for his collages, made of papier-mÃ¢chÃ©, plaster, and aluminum. Some of his works resembled small boulders; others were masks of varying sizes; later sculptures suggested sausages&#8212;or phalluses. As a teenager, West had hung out at bars with an older set of artists known as the Viennese Actionists. A debauched bunch, they made performance art meant to shock and revolt the authorities: from public masturbation to rubbing themselves with the blood of slaughtered animals. âHe was a young guy sitting with them and drinking all the time,â recalls Eva Presenhuber, his Swiss dealer. âIt was a rock ânâ roll story: They did a lot of drugs, went to Afghanistan. You got opium and got high because you wanted to âgrow.â â</p>\n<p>Zwirner dedicated his first show to West&#8212;a bold stroke. Westâs work wasnât easy to love, but love it Zwirner did. Already he was showing he had an eye as keen as anyoneâs in contemporary art.</p>\n<p>âIt was a <em>rock ânâ roll</em> story: They went to Afghanistan. You got opium and got high because you <em>wanted</em> to âgrow.â â</p>\n<p>West seemed pleased, too. But as Presenhuber noted, the artist was acutely aware of his own talent, which in time would lead to tensions. âZwirner was a young gallerist, maybe a little too ambitious&#8212;he told Franz what to do all the time,â Presenhuber explains. âFranz started to hate that.â Through the 1990s, though, he held his tongue and enjoyed the stretch limos Zwirner provided on opening nights.</p>\n<p>Zwirner had no doubt he could make West a major name in the United States. It was just a matter of keeping him on track as an artist and not letting his demons get the better of him. Zwirner acknowledges that he sometimes tried to monitor Westâs behavior and keep him from engaging in excesses. That was a challenge, for West already had alcohol-related liver damage and at some point contracted hepatitis C.</p>\n<p>When Zwirner opened his gallery, the most propulsive force in the contemporary-art market was Larry Gagosian. Everyone knew his story: his Armenian roots; his modest upbringing as an accountantâs son working his way through U.C.L.A.; his starting job in the William Morris mail room, from which he was fired after a year; the period of low-level gigs&#8212;record store, bookstore, supermarket&#8212;until, as a parking-lot manager, he noticed a man selling posters out of the trunk of his car and thought he could do that, too.</p>\n<p>A poster-framing shop in L.A. led to a gallery, and then a fancier one, along with another in New York. He charmed dealer Leo Castelli, the prince of Pop art, while hustling sales with a brute force never before seen in the market. By 1991 he had a gallery on West 23rd Street&#8212;the Chelsea frontier&#8212;another in SoHo, and a block-size flagship on Madison Avenue.</p>\n<p>For all his success in the roller-coaster 1980s&#8212;recognizing the genius of a young Jean-Michel Basquiat before almost anyone else, selling modern masterpieces in excess of $10 million to publisher S. I. Newhouse (who resurrected <em>VANITY FAIR</em> in 1983), then reselling some of the paintings for even more to entertainment mogul David Geffen&#8212;Gagosian had a secret longing. He wanted his own primary artists. Basquiat, for all the still-wet canvases Gagosian bought and sold, was represented by Swiss dealer Bruno Bischofberger and later by Mary Boone; the rest of Gagosianâs triumphs were secondary sales.</p>\n<p>One of his early breakthroughs was Cy Twombly, the artist whose elegant abstract paintings of hand-drawn scribbles and flower-like shapes werenât yet astronomically valued, in part because Twombly had left the New York art scene years before to reside in Italy. At first, as Gagosian made his pitch to represent him, Twombly seemed standoffish, and the dealer feared his effort had been in vain. In desperation, he blurted out, âWhy donât you give the Armenian a chance?â Twombly found that hilarious and signed on.</p>\n<p>Gagosian went from peak to peak in the 90s, taking on Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons, among other enormously lucrative artists. Poaching Franz West from David Zwirner in 2001 was, for Gagosian, a modest move, almost an afterthought. One of his senior directors in London, Stefan Ratibor, had suggested West would be a good&#8212;and profitable&#8212;fit. âHe was the architect of that,â Gagosian says.</p>\n<p>Westâs motives were mixed. He liked the prospect of joining the gallery that had Cy Twombly. Also, in addition to Ratibor, West knew and liked a Gagosian director named Ealan Wingate. But for West, as for Gagosian, this marriage was mostly about power, prestige, and money. Gagosian was well on his way to global dominance, with a foothold in London to complement his three New York galleries. He had his detractors, rough as he could sometimes be in his business dealings. But none could deny the beauty of his shows, from his clean, Castelli-like exhibition spaces to the gorgeous frames and museum-quality catalogues. There was, perhaps, one more reason for West to bolt. Gagosian was no schoolmarm; he wasnât going to tell West how to live. For Zwirner, Westâs departure was a devastating and baffling blow. âI loved him as a person as well as an artist,â Zwirner recalls, âand we had worked so hard for him.â What more could the dealer have done? Slowly it sank in: nothing. Gagosian simply had more money and clout.</p>\n<p>Westâs departure changed everything for Zwirner. âIt made clear to me that I had to grow,â he explains. Zwirner needed a space big enough to excite artists with its exhibition potential and to draw talent from other galleries. He leased one, in 2002, in the heart of Chelsea.</p>\n<p>Zwirnerâs record by now was remarkable, one hot primary artist after another: Diana Thater, who made site-specific video installations depicting the contrasts between nature and modern culture, and Jason Rhoades, whose anti-social installations were tinged with wry humor&#8212;the first, <em>CHERRY Makita</em>, depicted the artist as mechanic in a body shop, working on a car engine that actually turned on, its toxic fumes piped out of the gallery to keep from killing the curious. For secondary sales, where the most profits lay, Zwirner teamed up with dealers Iwan and Manuela Wirth, smoothing their way to New York from Switzerland while they helped him reach European collectors: not until 2009 would the two parties split.</p>\n<p>Yet for all his success, Zwirner nursed a grudge against Gagosian, who, in turn, had his own grievances. He bridled at Zwirnerâs public pique, expressed after Gagosian wooed away portraitist John Currin from dealer Andrea Rosen with a brusqueness that startled the art world. âOur generation doesnât have that aggressive behavior,â Zwirner declared. Gagosian was furious. âIf the tables were turned, heâd do the same thing,â Gagosian now says. âZwirner had a lot of nerve trying to burnish his ethics on my hide.â</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, the two dealers were alike in many ways. Both were tall&#8212;over six feet&#8212;tightly coiled, and fit. Perhaps Zwirner was in better shape, given his passion for surfing off Montauk, but Gagosian, nearly two decades older, was no slouch. Both had close-cropped silvery hair and wore a uniform of casual shirts and jeans. Both had a keen eye for art, both were tough bargainers, and both thrilled to the art of the deal. Both, as it happened, were jazz aficionados.</p>\n<p>The contrasts were just as striking. Zwirner was a family man, devoted to his wife and three young children. His circle of friends came mainly from the art community. Gagosianâs personal life involved a succession of girlfriends, lavish parties, and luxurious stays on the yachts of friends who were also business partners.</p>\n<p>Unlike Zwirner, Gagosian had been a pioneer of âhistoricalâ shows of works not for sale: museum-like exhibitions of artists such as Edward Hopper, Yves Klein, and Andy Warhol, curated by world-class experts like the late Picasso biographer and <em>VANITY FAIR</em> contributor John Richardson. Also unlike Zwirner, Gagosian had generally stayed away from new artists. No emerging talents just out of art school. No brilliant discoveries in their 20s. âI like it when thereâs some momentum&#8212;the artist has some traction,â he says. âThe economics of it [are] more attractive.â Also, as he notes, âwhen theyâre up the food chain, and their prices are up, they tend to be better artists.â But, he adds with a laugh, âsometimes you see a young artist whoâs really a genius and you have to resist the temptation to do anything!â</p>\n<p>As they signed on with the older dealer, the artists experienced a new phenomenon: the Gagosian effect. His wealthy collectors stood ready to buy what Gagosian suggested they buy. Newly signed artists, as a result, tended to see their work spike in price over the course of a year or two. (Gagosian would be accused in one high-profile lawsuit of misrepresenting the worth of an artwork to cosmetics billionaire Ron Perelman, only to have the suit dismissed. Gagosian is currently named in two suits regarding the supposed non-delivery of Jeff Koons sculptures. Gagosian has said the works will be handed over when theyâre ready.)</p>\n<p>Collectors, more than artists, seemed to make Gagosianâs world go round. The dealer gave elegant dinners, either at one of his homes or his favorite restaurant, Mr. Chow, on East 57th Street. Art-market lawyer Aaron Richard Golub, who had started as a social acquaintance of Gagosianâs and ended up fighting him in court, attended a number of those parties and appreciated the dynamic involved. The guests, he noted, were nearly all male and, of course, quite wealthy.</p>\n<p>For collectors who might be a bit insecure, being invited to Gagosianâs soirÃ©es conferred a heady validation. They could drop Gagosianâs name in art circles&#8212;just âLarryâ to them&#8212;and tell friends that this or that painting had been bought from him. The Gagosian brand name was now nearly as important as the artistsâ.</p>\n<p>These gatherings were often sprinkled with a few of Gagosianâs artists. âThe artists just stand in one place; theyâre stationary,â Golub explains. âYou can talk to them and shake their hands.â But not just anyone could stroll up to them. âThose who get that privilege have either bought Gagosian art or are about to do so. The handshake is very helpful.â</p>\n<p>The guests had one thing in common: theyâd bought art from Larry. And so, to make conversation, they talked about what artworks they had. They visited one anotherâs vast homes to see each othersâ collections, and often saw works by the same artists. The âLarry collection,â as Golub puts it, would typically feature a Damien Hirst. Also a Mark Grotjahn, a Richard Prince, an Ed Ruscha, a Cy Twombly, and a Rudolf Stingel. And, if the collector had outdoor space, a Richard Serra and, of course, a Koons sculpture.</p>\n<p>As a Gagosian artist, Franz West saw his star rise, both in Europe and in the U.S. Along with his rough-hewn sculpture, he designed lines of playful furniture; Gagosian sold those, too. West had no quarrel with his dealer, or his principal go-between, Ealan Wingate&#8212;not yet, at least. His personal life was where the complications lay.</p>\n<p>Shortly after signing on with Gagosian, West hired a pixie-ish studio assistant 24 years his junior, and the two fell in love. Tbilisi-born Tamuna Sirbiladze was an artist herself&#8212;a good one&#8212;and loved West enough to become his wife. But when a young writer named Benedikt Ledebur began working with West on the books that arose from his art, Sirbiladze was drawn to him as well. Ledebur was likewise smitten, despite the fact that he, too, was married, and had two children.</p>\n<p>An open relationship ensued. From this unconventional arrangement came a son, LazarÃ© Otto, born in 2008, and a daughter, Emily Anouk, born in 2009. The identity of the biological father was an issue but not one that any of the three cared to pursue. âI did have a relationship with Tamuna at the same time,â Ledebur says. âWhen she had children, Franz said he wanted them as his own.â As Westâs Swiss dealer, Eva Presenhuber, puts it, it was a very Viennese tale. âFranz liked complicated situations,â she contends. âHe provoked things like this.â</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>Presenhuber observes that family life failed to bring West the happiness he sought. âI always said to Franz, âItâs interesting you have these children,â â she recalls. âHe said, âIâm more like the grandfather to them.â â Presenhuber says West often spoke of seeking a divorce. Ledebur admits the troika had âdifficult phasesâ but says West always fell back in love with his family&#8212;and kept working with Ledebur.</p>\n<p>With an eye toward his legacy, West began talking to Gagosianâs Wingate about how to safeguard his art. West had formed a nonprofit archive some years before, but he had come to regret the power heâd ceded to its director. What he needed, he felt, was a repository for his art, from which it could be shown and sold, and into which he could put the archive. âI know that Franz wanted to have this foundation,â Presenhuber says. âHe had been in touch with lawyers two years before.â</p>\n<p>With Sirbiladzeâs help, West had stopped drinking. But he had lived too hard in his youth to escape the consequences. By early 2012 he was losing his fight against hepatitis C and cirrhosis. Hoping the Italian sun would help, West moved to Naples to live and work while Sirbiladze tended to the children in Vienna. Soon, however, he fell into a coma and was checked into a private clinic.</p>\n<p>West had stabilized by the time Ealan Wingate dispatched a private plane to Naples. The urgent message, says Ledebur, was that West return with doctors to Vienna. Only there could they sign all the documents needed to ratify the foundation West had planned on. Ledebur says West protested: he wanted to stay in Naples and had managed to line up a potential liver transplant in Nice.</p>\n<p>Wingate, according to Ledebur, insisted on bringing West home to Vienna: the jet was already booked. Erich Gibel, who would become one of the foundationâs lawyers, disputes that version: âWest was flown to Vienna at his own request. So it is not true that Ealan Wingate [pushed] to bring West home.â Westâs friends saw the tussle as a sign of the Gagosian camp asserting itself, possibly against its artistâs personal wishes. Others saw yet another chapter in the West-family drama. Some even wondered if Zwirner, in some way, might enter the fray; he remained close to the archiveâs director and made a point of staying in touch.</p>\n<p>Soon after checking into a Viennese hospital, West was visited by Wingate. With him were the putative members of the new Franz West foundation. Wingate had brought along a notary public and documents for West to sign. Christoph Kerres, who would serve as lawyer for Benedikt Ledebur and Westâs estate until 2017, suggests that West was no longer in his right mind when he signed the documents. âWhen the notary was present in the hospital, Franz West was about to be taken into intensive care,â he says. âIt remains questionable if Franz West understood the consequences of the notarial deed.â</p>\n<p>Why otherwise would West assign all of his art and assets to a foundation, Kerres notes, leaving nothing of his work to his widow and children? For into the foundation would go all of Westâs royalties, copyrights, art, and assets, including all the holdings in the nonprofit archive. Foundation lawyer Erich Gibel takes issue with this interpretation of Westâs intentions. He maintains that West&#8212;not Gagosian and not Wingate&#8212;âhad the clear desire to establish the foundation and wanted to bring in his whole oeuvre.â It was, says Gibel, Westâs âdying wish: the artistâs way of protecting his assets.â</p>\n<p>Less than a week later&#8212;on July 25, 2012&#8212;West was dead. His widow was shown the foundation documents: a <em>fait accompli</em>. âThe night after Franz died,â Ledebur recalls, âEalan was standing in [the artistâs] flat, telling Tamuna that all this art now belongs to the foundationâ&#8212;not to Westâs two children, his direct heirs. Wingate, in Ledeburâs telling, conveyed it as good news, supposedly saying, âYou donât have to live in a museum. We can get you furniture you like.â Wingate, according to Ledebur, added that he would send someone from the foundation over to make a list of the works before the foundation took possession of them. Ledebur recalls Sirbiladze being stunned.</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>According to West foundation lawyer David Stockhammer, âEalan Wingate did not go to the apartment of Franz West. Nor would he indicate anything regarding ownership or possession of any of Franzâs works. Language like âyou donât have to live in a museum, we can get you furniture you likeâ is not anything that Ealan Wingate would say. On the contrary, Ealan Wingate had been with Tamuna for the previous days and was providing her lots of support.â</p>\n<p>So began the years-long court battle. Sirbiladze sued the foundation, claiming it had sucked up all of her late husbandâs work without her permission. The Gagosian gallery was not named in the suit, but Sirbiladze had concerns that the man chosen to oversee the foundation was a Gagosian director, Ealan Wingate. His title was âprotectorâ of the foundation&#8212;a lifetime appointment. According to the documents, he had the power to name all board members under him and to sell or consign Westâs work to galleries. One indicator was the foundationâs selection of consignee for the late artistâs playful lines of furniture. For its U.S. distributor, the foundation chose the Gagosian gallery.</p>\n<p>Gibel, the foundation lawyer, says that despite Wingateâs title and authority, the Gagosian gallery had nothing to do with the court case âand also â¦ nothing to do with the foundation.â That wasnât how some in the art market saw it. âZwirner and Gagosian fight,â suggested collector and dealer Adam Lindemann, and Westâs reputation âalways suffers.â</p>\n<p>Through Westâs last years, Zwirner had had little contact with the artist. âWe bumped into each other a couple of times, but there was no love lost on either side after he left,â Zwirner admits. Yet he appeared to be playing the long game. Quietly, he kept buying Westâs work whenever he could and, at the same time, kept ingratiating himself with the nonprofit archive, always eager to be of assistance.</p>\n<p>Two years after Westâs death, Zwirner, who had effectively been frozen out, staged a major show of his work in New York&#8212;much of it with art Zwirner owned&#8212;and invited Westâs widow, Sirbiladze, along with Ledebur and the two West children. âIt was during this trip that the family ended up staying in the galleryâs artist/guest apartment, and I got to know Benedikt and Tamuna well,â Zwirner recalls. âTamuna was gregarious, an engaged mother, a very interesting artist in her own right, and full of fond memories of her life with Franz. She was devastated and appalled by the goings-on.â</p>\n<p>Christoph Kerres says he found one clause of the new foundationâs documents mind-boggling&#8212;and motivating. The legal papers West had signed called for <em>all</em> of his artworks to be put in the foundation. That violated a fundamental legal tenet in Austria, where children are entitled to 50 percent of a parentâs inheritance, period.</p>\n<p>âThe foundation has so far never denied or contested that the children of Franz West are entitled to 50 percent,â says Gibel. As far as the foundation was concerned, Westâs wife and children had come out well. They were inheriting, as Gibel put it, a luxurious villa, five apartments in Vienna, five cars, cash, and Westâs private collection of other artistsâ work. All this, Gibel says, added up to $17 million. Kerres begs to differ. The children got two apartments, he declares, and the villa, which was more like âa cottage.â The cars were a modest substitute for paintings and sculptures. As for Westâs collection of other artistsâ work, it was, Kerres acknowledges, of meaningful worth&#8212;so much so that the foundation reclaimed it, according to Kerres, after having it appraised at $10 million.</p>\n<p>A settlement seemed close in early 2016, one in which the children might get a substantial chunk of their fatherâs estate and the foundation the rest. Then came a tragic twist: Tamuna Sirbiladzeâs death from cancer at age 45. One of her last legal efforts was to question the fees that some foundation board members were paid. That June, the Austrian Supreme Court found that the foundationâs three-person secondary board had paid themselves âsuspiciousâ sums: salaries totaling more than $560,000 over a five-month period in 2012, followed in 2013 by payments of some $900,000. The secondary board members were expelled by the court. No such sums were associated with Wingate, who remained in charge. But now one court decision after another went against the West foundation.</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>âI think Ealan was a bit too nosy, too clever,â suggests Presenhuber. âHe should have drawn Tamuna in and told her 50 percent would go to the kids.â Instead, the foundation hung tough. Even after the Austrian Appellate Court quashed its appeal in June 2017, the foundation asked for an appeal to the Supreme Court. The foundation also threw the estate a curve: Franz West had had a sister. The foundation lawyer became her lawyer, too, asserting on her behalf that she&#8212;though not named in any of Westâs wills, according to two sources&#8212;was the rightful heir, not Westâs children.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Courtâs ruling, when it came in, this January, was a mortal blow to the foundation. The court ruled that it had had no right to take Westâs art. It was ordered to give all its assets back to Westâs estate, and back they have been coming, piecemeal.</p>\n<p>Two months ago, however, another Austrian court found in favor of Westâs sister, declaring <em>her</em> to be the rightful heir. While some insiders expect the courtâs decision to be overturned, if the sister <em>does</em> prevail, she will inherit all of the art that has gone from the foundation back to the estate. Because of the 50 percent inheritance rule, she would have to give the children their half of the estate in cash. But she could still end up with tens of millions herself.</p>\n<p>Over the years in this battle royal, all four mega-dealers have come to dominate the contemporary-art market. Hauser &amp; Wirth is building a colossal space on West 22nd Street. Arne Glimcher, of Pace, is erecting an eight-story extravaganza on West 25th Street. Gagosian now has 16 outposts around the world; he was the first to build a supersize gallery in Chelsea. And Zwirner is putting up a $50 million space on West 21st Street. In it, he will be able to showcase one of his newest artists, if the court so rules: none other than Franz West.</p>\n<p>For some years now, the West estate and Benedikt Ledebur had hoped to switch representation of Westâs works from Gagosian back to Zwirner. âZwirner,â says Presenhuber, âalways knew he would show West again.â And now it has come to pass: the late artist is technically back with the dealer whose admiration, if unreciprocated, has been constant all these years.</p>\n<p>Last fall, in Paris, the Centre Georges Pompidou staged a major West retrospective, which then moved to Londonâs Tate Modern, where it remains until June 2; at the same time Zwirner proudly opened a separate West show at <em>his</em> London gallery, with works from his private collection. Two floors are dedicated to the artist and a third to his ill-starred wife, Tamuna Sirbiladze, a show curated by her lover Benedikt Ledebur. âIs it a triumph?â Ledebur reflects. âYes, but a tragedy, too. Franz dead, Tamuna dead&#8212;the cost is too high.â</p>\n<p>With the disposition of Westâs work still uncertain, Zwirner will have to wait to learn how much of it he can take on, even as Westâs legacy continues to flower.</p>\n<p>Gagosian is hopeful, too. For there, in the dealerâs unparalleled online roster of global greats&#8212;roughly 100 artists in all&#8212;is Franz West. Gagosian has access to his own cache of West works, acquired by the gallery over the years. Win, lose, or draw, heâs still selling the masterâs bounty.</p>\n<p><em>Adapted from</em> Boom: Mad Money, Mega Dealers, and the Rise of Contemporary Art, <em>by Michael Shnayerson, to be published on May 21, 2019, by PublicAffairs.

Skeptics, who say last yearâs 3 percent increase in G.D.P. was based on the 2017 tax bill, deregulation, and increased government spending, the effects of which they say will fade by 2020, are effectively <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/economic-growth-reached-3-percent-first-time-decade-thanks-president-donald-j-trumps-policies/\">told to fuck off on official White House letterhead</a>.</p>\n<p>When the economy needs help&#8212;if, say, a recession is on the horizon&#8212;the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates to make borrowing cheaper in order to increase spending and spur economic growth. When itâs doing as well as Team Trump says it is, the Fed typically raises interest rates to make sure things donât overheat. Which made National Economic Council Director <strong>Larry Kudlowâs</strong> Friday demand a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/29/white-house-advisor-kudlow-says-fed-should-cut-rates-report.html\">bit of a head-scratcher</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow wants the Federal Reserve to âimmediatelyâ cut interest rates by 50 basis points. âI am echoing the presidentâs view&#8212;heâs not been bashful about that view&#8212;he would also like the Fed to cease shrinking its balance sheet. And I concur with that view,â Kudlow told CNBC Friday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a sign that the cognitive dissonance is especially strong with this administration, Kudlow insisted he wasnât calling for a rate cut out of fear the economy would slow down&#8212;remember, under Trump, it never will&#8212;but out of an alleged abundance of caution. âLooking at some of the indicators&#8212;I mean, the economy looks fundamentally quite healthy, we just donât want that threat,â Kudlow said. Yet, strangely, not everyone is buying the argument that the central bank must immediately lower rates in spite of a supposedly unstoppable economy. Could it be that the White House has a sinking feeling its economic projections are a bit too optimistic, and that things will turn right around the time of the next presidential election, hurting President Buy-and-Sellâs chances for a second term? In making these public requests now, is Team Trump trying to make the Fed the fall guy if economic growth does slow down? Some people&#8212;one of Kudlowâs former colleagues at CNBC, for instance&#8212;seem to think so!</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWapnerCNBC/status/1111712406642794502\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWapnerCNBC/status/1111712406642794502\">https://twitter.com/ScottWapnerCNBC/status/1111712406642794502</a></p></blockquote></div><div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWapnerCNBC/status/1111695729091842048\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWapnerCNBC/status/1111695729091842048\">https://twitter.com/ScottWapnerCNBC/status/1111695729091842048</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Meanwhile, just in case it wasnât clear that the administration has no intention of respecting the independence of the Federal Reserve, Trump, the perennial bankruptcy artist who has claimed to have more knowledge of monetary policy <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/donald-trump-jerome-powell-gut\">in his G.I. tract than âanybody elseâs brain,â</a> made sure to pile on:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1111745178824511489\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1111745178824511489\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1111745178824511489</a></p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Bay Area ride-hailing company had itself a pretty good day</strong></p>\n<p>Lyftâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/lyft-ipo-millionaires\">newly minted millionaires</a> know <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-29/lyft-jumps-in-debut-after-ride-hailing-ipo-raises-2-34-billion\">what weâre talking about</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lyft Inc., the No. 2 U.S. ride-hailing giant, jumped in its debut after raising $2.34 billion in an initial public offering that priced at the top of an elevated range, sending an encouraging signal to the stampede of Silicon Valley companies lining up to go public this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shares opened Friday morning at $87.24&#8212;21 percent above the I.P.O. price of $72&#8212;and drifted downward in the afternoon, closing up 8.7 percent to $78.29 in New York.

Persuading that person to take the job is likely to be even harder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While Wells Fargoâs finances are fundamentally sound, the bank faces a daunting list of problems: litigation, with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line; more than a dozen restrictions imposed by federal regulators; a largely demoralized workforce that is chafing under the bankâs leadership; and rigorous scrutiny of the bankâs next leader from high-profile members of Congress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âThis is a really hard search,â <strong>Jeanne Branthover,</strong> a managing partner at the executive-search firm DHR International, told the <em>New York Times,</em> putting it mildly. âNot everyone wants to lead something that could wreck their reputation.â</p>\n<p><strong>Congress to Trump: if you want the new NAFTA ratified, drop the tariff B.S.</strong></p>\n<p>If your only knowledge of U.S.M.C.A., the U.S.âs new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, i.e. NAFTA 2.0, was based on Trumpâs Twitter feed, you might be under the impression that it had gone into effect months ago, considering heâs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1080457560291987457\">claimed</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1075386058282545152?lang=en\">multiple occasions</a> that âMexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal.â But, surprise! It hasnât, and, currently, itâs unclear when or if it will, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/north-american-trade-deal-faces-early-headwinds-on-capitol-hill/2019/03/29/ef5b0d0c-5178-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html\">per <em>The Washington Post</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>President Trumpâs effort to rework a major trade deal with Canada and Mexico is showing increasing signs of faltering on Capitol Hill, straining under a variety of angry complaints from lawmakers of both parties who wonât commit to backing the plan . . . In the latest obstacle, key Republican senators including Finance Committee Chairman <strong>Charles E. Grassley</strong> (R-Iowa) have begun insisting stridently that Trump lift steel and aluminum tariffs imposed on Canada and Mexico as a precondition to any congressional vote. Grassley said in an interview Thursday that heâd made the case directly to Trump at a recent meeting, but that the president refused to budge. Nonetheless, Grassley predicted Trump would have no choice but to give in if he wants the new NAFTA deal&#8212;one of the signature promises of his presidential campaign&#8212;to advance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Canada, too, the tariffs are the biggest sticking point to consideration of a deal. Prime Minister <strong>Justin Trudeauâs</strong> government, weakened by domestic political controversy, faces voters in October. Canadaâs House of Commons has an ever-narrowing window to ratify the deal on their end, and it could be near impossible if the tariffs remain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âThe existence of these tariffs for many Canadians raises some serious questions about NAFTA ratification,â <strong>Chrystia Freeland,</strong> Canadaâs foreign minister, told reporters after a meeting with [Robert E.] Lighthizer this week. âI donât want to sound threatening, because that is not helpful, but practically speaking, we have an election coming up in Canada. It will be extraordinarily tough if steel and a aluminum tariffs are in place,â added <strong>David MacNaughton,</strong> Canadaâs ambassador to the United

out âphonyâ economic data, declaring that the jobs numbers were nowhere near as good as the Bureau of Labor Statistics claimed, and that the âtrueâ unemployment rate was <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-unemployment-rate-may-be-42-perc/\">probably more like 42 percent</a>. (Yes, he literally attempted to suggest that nearly half the country was looking for work.) Naturally, once he became president, that tune about the government faking official data changed faster than you can say â<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/jared-kushner-security-clearance\">DADDY, GIVE ME MY TOP SECURITY CLEARANCE</a>!â, and he was more than happy to believe, brag about, and take credit for the numbers the Labor Department reported, including the ones that came out when he had <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/trump-economic-adviser-says-trump-deserves-no-credit-for-strong-jobs-report\">barely been on the job for a month</a>.

But though he understands the global popularity of his best-known works&#8212;heâs seen bootlegged versions of his films sold on the streets of Jordan, and has had fans approach in Palestine to tell him that they are fans of Seinfeldâs eccentric neighbor, Kramer&#8212;he had never known such uniform praise before Netflix released his new four-part docuseries, <em>Larry Charlesâ Dangerous World of Comedy,</em> in the middle of February.</p>\n<p>âThe significance of this show to people&#8212;when they talk to me about it, personally, on the street&#8212;has been very, very sweet, and unexpected to me,â he said during a recent interview at a coffee shop in Los Angeles. âI mean, <em>Borat</em> got bad reviews. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/04/larry-charles-controversial-seinfeld-episodes-the-comedians\"><em>Seinfeld</em> was a slow build</a>. I donât know if Iâve had such a great response to anything Iâve ever done.â</p>\n<p>Armed with a cameraman, a soundman, and two producers&#8212;a crew that could essentially fit into one van&#8212;Charles and company traversed the globe looking for people who use humor to combat their dire circumstances. While he had ambitions to head into Asia, Latin America, and Syria, he was constrained by budgets and security issues. (All travel had to be cleared by the State Dept.) So instead, he focused his efforts on the Middle East and Africa, touching down in a slew of war-torn countries looking for comedians.</p>\n<p>The series shows Charles meeting a former warlord on the streets of Liberia: General Butt Naked, a nickname for <strong>Joshua Milton Blahyi,</strong> one of the most notorious commanders during the First Liberian Civil War. (He was known for leading his troops into battle nude.) Blahyi discusses his atrocious cannibalistic behaviors and penchant for human sacrifice with Charles before sharing that heâs a big fan of <strong>Bill Cosbyâs</strong> <em>Kids Say the Darndest Things.</em> Talk about irony.</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/51ccb6f2c2b4c00d58423fe3.js?autoplay=0\"></div></div><p>He tracks down Iraqâs <strong>Ahmed Albasheer,</strong> best known for his satirical talk show, the <em>Albasheer Show,</em> created in the vein of <em>The Daily Show.</em> In his quest to keep young people from joining ISIS, said Charles, Albasheer could either become the countryâs next president or risk his life doing so. Charles also interviews former child soldiers in Liberia, who use comedy to help ease the trauma of seeing their parents murdered. He discusses rape jokes with the most famous comedians in Nigeria. And he talks to U.S. veterans as well, including <strong>Bobby Henline,</strong> a retired Army sergeant who turned to stand-up after nearly 40 percent of his body was burned when his Humvee hit an I.E.D. in Iraq.</p>\n<p>In most cases, Charles was surprised by what he found during his quest. âI wasnât really looking to have an emotional experience, and all of my expectations were shattered. Everywhere I went, I was expecting one thing, and I got something way more,â he said. âI saw no bitterness, no anger. And no anger towards America. Iâm more angry than most of the people that I met.â</p>\n<p>Charles did encounter some hate in the U.S. itself, via far-right trolls who use anti-humor to promote their views of white supremacy. One of them, notorious neo-Nazi <strong>Tim Gionet,</strong> who goes by <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/08/baked-alaska-charlottesville-and-the-end-of-ironic-nazi.html\">Baked Alaska</a>, said that he was excited to talk to Charles, since he found <em>Borat,</em> and the absurdist characterâs anti-Semitic views, to be an inspiration. (He clearly didnât get the movie.) I asked Charles&#8212;a Jew from New York himself, raised in Trump Village in Brooklyn, New York&#8212;if he had reservations about including figures like this in the episode.</p>\n<p>âI didnât,â he said. âJust like I didnât have any reservations about talking to Buck Naked, to an ISIS person, to [terrorist group] al-Shabaab. I wanted to go into the heart of darkness with this, where humor is kind of oddly juxtaposed with horror and it comes in many forms.</p>\n<p>âI donât agree with pushing these people aside and marginalizing them,â Charles continued. âLetâs see what they have to say. Letâs understand it. I donât want to give these people a platform to sell their hate, but I want people to actually hear what they think, and have people make a judgment for themselves.â</p>\n<p>Charles began ruminating on the idea that would become this series in 2015. He was in Morocco for 11 months, shooting a movie starring <strong>Nicolas Cage</strong> called <em>Army of One</em>&#8212;produced by CondÃ© Nast Entertainment, which shares a parent company with <em>Vanity Fair</em>&#8212;and he saw a burgeoning comedy scene coming up in the middle of the Muslim monarchy.</p>\n<p>âI started thinking about all the international travel Iâve done with <strong>Sacha [Baron Cohen],</strong> and all the mayhem we created. But we get to leave, and we come home, and we get rewarded, and we get accolades. I thought, âWhat happens to these guys who stay? How do they survive?ââ</p>\n<p>That question coincided with Charles engaging in the most painful movie-making process of his career, one that resulted in him losing control of his film in âa long, horrible saga.â Eventually, he said, he was kicked out of the editing room as the film was recut with different music and a new ending, then sent straight to video. âIt really just destroyed me,â he said. âI swore to myself that I was done with that.â</p>\n<p>Rather than engaging in a big studio movie again, what Charles craved was control of a small, upstart crew that could nimbly traverse locations and capture footage in an authentic, vÃ©ritÃ© manner. âI loved making <em>Borat.</em> I loved making <em>Religulous,</em>â he said. âIâm a guerrilla army guy, not a big platoon person. Leading platoons like on <em>Army of One</em> or <em>The Dictator,</em> itâs too unwieldy. This way, it was very pure and very urgent, and I think you feel that urgency when you watch it.â</p>\n<p>Charles has been buoyed by the anecdotal reception to his new show, though <em>Dangerous World</em>âs residence on Netflix means he has yet to see any hard viewership numbers. He would like to set out for a second season, hopefully reaching some of the countries he couldnât hit the first time: Yemen, Venezuela, Syria. But he also has other ambitions: a <em>Dangerous World of Comedy</em> tour, perhaps, or longer stand-alone interviews with some of his most compelling subjects that Netflix could air in their entirety.</p>\n<p>One thing is for sure: Charles wants more.</p>\n<p>âIâm always looking to do challenging, provocative things,â he said. âI donât really care about the medium. I donât really care if itâs fiction or nonfiction. Iâm looking, again, to have this pure, urgent filmmaking experience. Iâm looking to present stories that nobody else really could. Iâm trying to delve deeper into my niche.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; âThereâs no tragedyâ: Selma Blair <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/selma-blairs-transformation?inline\">opens up about her M.S. diagnosis</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What <em>Green Book</em>âs best-picture win <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/what-green-books-best-picture-oscar-does-and-does-not-mean?inline\">means about movie awards</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; How Rami Malek <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/oscars-2019-rami-malek-wins-best-actor-speech-bryan-singer?inline\">went from underdog to best-actor winner</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Meghan Markleâs $200K baby shower: <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/meghan-markle-baby-shower?inline\">an in-depth analysis</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Look at these <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2019/02/inside-the-2019-vanity-fair-oscar-party?inline\">Oscar party photos</a>!</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Laughing Matters","socialTitle":"Thought Borat Was Daring?

In an episode inspired by <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em>&#8212;in which Garry Shandling manned his own fictional late-night program with plenty of acerbic dissatisfaction behind the scenes&#8212;Fallon grew increasingly impatient as all of his guests, including sidekick <strong>Steve Higgins,</strong> derailed what was supposed to be a fun anniversary program. To kick things off, he trotted out an angry <strong>Ben Stiller</strong> and a grouchy <strong>Tina Fey.</strong></p>\n<p>Stiller shows up in a panda suit to âsurpriseâ Fallon, who accidentally sees him early after a cockroach infestation drives the comedian out of his dressing room. (The cockroaches, courtesy of a previous appearance from <strong>Robert Irwin,</strong> become a running joke.) Stiller spends the rest of the episode <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auv-cuCsTxM\">angrily wandering the halls</a> of 30 Rock before storming onto the stage for a brief, awkward appearance.</p>\n<p>Throughout the episode, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong.

Fallon is caught yelling at 15-year-old Irwin on a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWelcIFAPxE\">hot mic</a>. Even the showâs writers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beRnnjrh1Uc\">prank</a> their boss by feeding him an embarrassing monologue for a Telemundo promotional clip.

All night, Fallonâs colleagues discuss his puffy face and weight gain&#8212;and in perhaps the harshest moment of the entire episode, Fey mutters, âTrump got elected because of youâ during her appearance.

Republican National Party for trying to lock down the presidential primary.","promoDek":"Maryland Governor Larry Hogan is calling out the Republican National Party for trying to lock down the presidential primary.","body":"<p>Maryland Governor <strong>Larry Hogan</strong> is still playing (sort of) coy. When asked on Wednesday about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/larry-hogan-2020-republican-primary-challenge\">reports</a> that heâs weighing a primary challenge to <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> he <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/larry-hogan-maryland-governor-isnt-ruling-out-primary-challenge-to-trump/\">replied</a>, âIâm being approached from a lot of different people, and I guess the best way to put it is I havenât thrown them out of my office.â Despite the stream of visitors, which has reportedly included ur-Never Trumper <strong>Bill Kristol,</strong> Hogan faces a near-insurmountable hurdle: the incipient Trump campaign has essentially absorbed the R.N.C., joining forces with the party and boxing out any potential primary challenger, while working to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-2020-republican-party-purge-delegates\">ensure</a> that only delegates loyal to Trump show up on the convention floor. When Hoganâs name surfaced a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/larry-hogan-2020-republican-primary-challenge\">month ago</a>, Trumpâs campaign director, <strong>Chris Carr,</strong> fired a warning shot: âAny potential challenger should understand that the Trump campaign is better organized than any campaign in history, especially with the support of the Republican Party, which is firmly behind the president.â</p>\n<p>Even if heâs not quite ready to announce a challenge, Hoganâs clearly peeved at Carrâs chutzpah. In an interview with Politico published Thursday, the popular Maryland governor <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/larry-hogan-2020-trump-1179635\">ripped</a> the R.N.C.âs strategy to lock down the 2020 primary, calling it an âunprecedentedâ move. âItâs very undemocratic and to say, âWeâre in some cases not going to allow a debate, we may not have a primary,ââ he said. âAnd the question is, what are they afraid of? Because on the one hand you look at polls, 70 percent of Republicans support the president in a primary. Why are they so concerned? Why the puffing out the chest?â</p>\n<p>The answer, he proposed, is that Republican leadership is genuinely worried about Trumpâs viability, particularly as <strong>Robert Muellerâs</strong> report looms. âPerhaps the way things look today are not the way they think things look a few months from now or next week or six months from now,â Hogan said. âMaybe theyâre concerned that they will drop in the polls and that they could be at some point down the road be subject to a threat in a primary.â</p>\n<p>Hogan is correct: numerous <a href=\"https://thehill.com/campaign-polls/428396-poll-4-out-of-10-republicans-want-a-primary-opponent-for-trump\">polls</a>, particularly out of swing states like <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/donald-trump-2020-wisconsin-polling\">Wisconsin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/2020-republican-presidential-primary-iowa-poll\">Iowa</a>, have found that, though Republican voters would likely vote for Trump again in 2020, they are open to a primary challenger. Notably, few want to see anyone with a national profile run again&#8212;in Wisconsin, for instance, Trump soundly beat former rivals <strong>Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio,</strong> and likely candidate <strong>John Kasich</strong>&#8212;but that could leave the door open to relative unknowns. Hogan, who easily won re-election in blue-leaning Maryland, may be in a position to offer Republican voters a Trump alternative. âIâve been pretty clear, I donât like the tone that the president uses,â he <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/larry-hogan-maryland-governor-isnt-ruling-out-primary-challenge-to-trump/\">told</a> CBS on Wednesday. âI think there are times where he acts irrationally, and makes decisions and . . . does things in a way that arenât great for the Republican Party, or for the country, or for him and his agenda, for that matter. I mean, I think sometimes he can be his own worst enemy.â</p>\n<p>Trumpâs behavior in 2016 and beyond could certainly pose a problem. âI think you would see a number of potential challengers in the Republican Party consider jumping inâ if Muellerâs report proves damning, Hogan warned. That, in turn, could cripple Trump&#8212;presidents forced to spend precious time and resources campaigning against a challenger typically end up losing the general election. (<strong>Bill Weld,</strong> the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, is going this route, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bill-weld-2020-republican-primary-challenge\">announcing</a> a kamikaze-style campaign earlier this month.) Other potential candidates are reportedly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/republicans-waiting-for-mueller-report-trump-2020-primary\">lying in wait</a>, eyes trained on the special counsel. But if people like <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> and <strong>Ben Sasse</strong> are remaining quiet for now&#8212;they do, after all, have to be team players in the Senate&#8212;Hogan clearly has no compunctions about speaking his mind, visiting Iowa, and conferring with New Hampshire power brokers at Saint Anselm College. âAt this point in time, I donât see any path to winning a Republican primary against this president, or anybody doing it. But things have a way of changing,â he said. âI donât know what the lay of the land is going to look like this summer, or in the fall.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity

Now, Spade will try and make 11:30 work with a new nightly series that, for now, remains untitled. The show will air Monday through Thursday.</p>\n<p>Longtime Comedy Central fans might recall that Spade hosted a show on the cable network once before: <em>The Showbiz Show with David Spade.</em> The series, which took its inspiration from Spadeâs â<a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update---david-spade/n10395\">Hollywood Minute</a>â segments on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>âs âWeekend Update,â ran for three seasons, parodying celebrity news shows like <em>Entertainment Tonight.</em> Itâs unclear how closely Spadeâs new program might hew to that old formula, but Comedy Centralâs <a href=\"https://press.cc.com/press-release/2019/02/11/comedy-central-announces-new-late-night-series\">press release</a> does promise the series will offer Spadeâs âsignature take on the pop-culture news of the day,â with a rotating group of Spadeâs famous friends as well as field segments that mimic Instagram Stories&#8212;an art form Spade is particularly <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/davidspade/?hl=en\">fond of</a>.</p>\n<p>For more  details, letâs turn to Spade himself, whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcHkYtzki20\">announcement</a> at least offers one concrete promise. âWeâre gonna cover everything,â Spade says. âPop culture; whateverâs funny; whateverâs stupid; whateverâs dumb. Itâll be me and my stupid friends. Weâll talk about <strong>Cardi B,</strong> Cardi C, Cardi D . . . But the big headline is, there will be no politics&#8212;mostly because Iâm too stupid. I went to community college. I have six credits in anthropology. I donât even understand whatâs going on out there.

The generally positive response from his favored outlets&#8212;Drudgeâs headline blared âTrump Rocks Houseâ&#8212;has pleased the president this week, sources said. âHeâs been in a good mood,â another prominent Republican said. And the no-socialism themes were seen as a potent weapon against Democrats in 2020&#8212;the first hopeful sign in a while.</p>\n<p>But while the State of the Union adjusted the presidentâs mood, it wasnât enough to re-align the underlying dysfunction of the West Wing. Morale inside the White House, never high to begin with, has turned particularly bleak, according to interviews with 10 former West Wing officials and Republicans close to the president. The issue is that many see Trump himself as the problem. âTrump is hated by everyone inside the White House,â a former West Wing official told me. His shambolic management style, paranoia, and pattern of blaming staff for problems of his own making have left senior White House officials burned out and resentful, sources said. âItâs total misery. People feel trapped,â a former official said. âTrump always needs someone to blame,â a second former official said. Sources said the leak of Trumpâs private schedules to Axios&#8212;which revealed how little work Trump actually does&#8212;was a signal of how disaffected his staff has become.</p>\n<p>White House Communications Director <strong>Bill Shine</strong> has told friends heâs angry that Trump has singled him out for the bad press during the government shutdown. âBill is like, âyouâre the guy who steps on the message more than anyone,ââ said a Republican whoâs spoken with Shine recently. Economic adviser <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong> has told people heâs probably got six months left. âLarryâs really tired of it all,â a source close to Kudlow said.</p>\n<p>Whatâs driving a lot of the frustration is that Trump, now more than ever, runs the West Wing as a family business. Four sources said the only White House advisers he truly consults are daughter <strong>Ivanka</strong> and son-in-law <strong>Jared Kushner.</strong> âThis is a family affair, and if youâre not in the family, youâve got problems,â a former official said. The special privileges and access afforded to Kushner and Ivanka have been alienating Trumpâs acting chief of staff, <strong>Mick Mulvaney.</strong> âMick is not entirely thrilled with the family,â a Republican close to Mulvaney told me. Multiple sources said Mulvaney is looking for a way out of the West Wing. Heâs said to be interested in a Cabinet position, either at the Commerce Department or Treasury, and heâs reportedly been pursuing the University of South Carolina presidency. A senior White House official recently lobbied a friend of Mulvaneyâs to convince Mulvaney to stay.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Mulvaney is working to stave off another political crisis before Trump either shuts the government down again or declares a state of emergency to fund his southern border wall. One source briefed on the internal debate said that Mulvaney is advising Trump to accept less than his demand of $5 billion and make up the difference by shuffling money around the existing budget. âMick wants to re-program existing funds,â the source said. Trump has insisted he wonât compromise, but he faces no good options, with a G.O.P. revolt likely if he goes the national-emergency route. âTrump is going to declare whatever happens a victory,â a former West Wing official said.</p>\n<p>The White House declined to comment.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is Americaâs most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>âs 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, TimothÃ©e Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Capitol Hill","socialTitle":"âTrump Is Hated by Everyoneâ: Trumpâs SOTU Euphoria Masks West Wing Misery","socialDescription":"The leak of his schedules is a sign of deep disaffection.

In a statement to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/liam-neeson-racist-comment-apology-1203176270/\"><em>Variety</em></a>, Neeson said that by telling the story in the first place, he âmissed the point and hurt many people.â</p>\n<p>âOver the last several weeks, I have reflected on and spoken to a variety of people who were hurt by my impulsive recounting of a brutal rape of a dear female friend nearly 40 years ago and my unacceptable thoughts and actions at that time in response to this crime,â Neeson said in a statement. âThe horror of what happened to my friend ignited irrational thoughts that do not represent the person I am. In trying to explain those feelings today, I missed the point and hurt many people at a time when language is so often weaponized and an entire community of innocent people are targeted in acts of rage. What I failed to realize is that this is not about justifying my anger all those years ago, it is also about the impact my words have today. I was wrong to do what I did. I recognize that, although the comments I made do not reflect, in any way, my true feelings nor me, they were hurtful and divisive. I profoundly apologize.â</p>\n<p>Neeson originally told the story in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/liam-neeson-interview-rape-race-black-man-revenge-taken-cold-pursuit-a8760896.html\"><em>The Independent</em></a>, drawing a comparison between himself and his character in the revenge thriller <em>Cold Pursuit</em>. While trying to explain why revenge doesnât work, he used an example from his own life: years ago, he said, a female friend of his was raped by a black man. When she told Neeson about the attack, he went out into the street, âhoping Iâd be approached by somebody&#8212;Iâm ashamed to say that&#8212;and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some <em>[gesturing with air quotes]</em> âblack bastardâ would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could . . . kill him.â Neeson ended the anecdote by saying that it took a week and a half to calm down.</p>\n<p>The story immediately went viral after it was published, forcing Neeson to go on <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/liam-neeson-good-morning-america-rape-revenge-im-not-racist\"><em>Good Morning America</em> and clarify</a> the situation.</p>\n<p>âI did seek help,â the actor said. âI went to a priest that heard my confession . . . Two very, very good friends that I talked to. And, believe it or not, power walking. Two hours every day to get rid of this. Iâm not racist.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/10-undeniable-facts-about-the-michael-jackson-sexual-abuse-allegations?inline\">10 undeniable facts</a> about Michael Jacksonâs sexual abuse allegations</p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/bob-greenblatt-hbo-plepler-battle-with-netflix?inline\">new HBO</a>&#8212;and its coming battle with Netflix</p>\n<p>&#8212; <em>Captain Marvel</em> is a period piece, a space adventure, and an attempt at feminist filmmaking&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/captain-marvel-movie-review?inline\">and, our critic writes, it mostly succeeds</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Thought <em>Borat</em> was daring?

is your idea of perfect happiness?</strong> Late one Sunday afternoon, my three-year-old granddaughter, out of the blue, took my hand and said she wanted to whisper something to me. Could we go for a ride around the block before we all sat down for dinner? Just the two of us? Holding hands as we walked to and from the car in the driveway: Bliss.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your greatest fear?</strong> That we will be remembered as a people who locked our fellow citizens in cages and who believe that some people are rich and some people are poor because âitâs their natureâ and that racism and poverty are inevitable parts of the order of things; that M.L.K. and Bobby Kennedy died in vain; and that no one any longer believes what M.L.K. said in his Nobel Prize address in Oslo: âThere is nothing new about poverty. What is new, however, is that we have the resources to get rid of it.â</p>\n<p><strong>Which historical figure do you most identify with?</strong> I most admire W. E. B. Du Bois, for the same reason that M.L.K. did: âOne idea he insistently taught was that black people have been kept in oppression and deprivation by a poisonous fog of lies that depicted them as inferior, born deficient, and deservedly doomed to servitude to the grave.â¦ So long as the lie was believed the brutality and criminality of conduct toward the Negro was easy for the conscience to bear. The twisted logic ran: If the black man was inferior he was not oppressed&#8212;his place in society was appropriate to his meager talent and intellect. Dr. Du Bois recognized that the keystone in the arch of oppression was the myth of inferiority and he dedicated his brilliant talents to demolish it.â But there was only one Du Bois. I donât identify myself with him; I admire him.</p>\n<p><strong>Which living person do you most admire?</strong> Itâs a tie between Vernon Eulion Jordan Jr., Wole Soyinka, and Oprah Winfrey. All are fearless, all know themselves, all have examined themselves, and all are comfortable with what they have seen.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your greatest extravagance?</strong> Signed first editions in dust jackets by pre-Harlem Renaissance writers. And suits made by a London tailor.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite journey?</strong> Then: hitchhiking across the equator with Lawrence Biddle Weeks when I was 20. Now: the drive to the ferry at Woods Hole on July 1.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your greatest regret?</strong> Not realizing that I was never meant to become a medical doctor or a lawyer sooner than I did.</p>\n<p><strong>What or who is the greatest love of your life?</strong> Producing films and writing about the historical experiences of black people.</p>\n<p><strong>When and where were you happiest?</strong> Well, Iâm happiest on Marthaâs Vineyard, between July 1 and Labor Day, riding my tricycle with Larry Bobo every afternoon and fishing with Buddy Vanderhoop. But I was happiest from my childhood through high school in Piedmont, West Virginia; it was magical. I was sorry when it was time to go off to college.</p>\n<p><strong>Which talent would you most like to have?</strong> Iâd love to be able to do Japanese calligraphy. And slam-dunk a basketball.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your current state of mind?</strong> Iâm worried that Donald Trump is not an aberration, but the beginning of a trend.</p>","rubric":"Proust Questionnaire","socialTitle":"Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. Answers the Proust Questionnaire","socialDescription":"The producer and host of the docuseries Reconstruction: America After the Civil War and author of Stony the Road talks calligraphy, hitchhiking, and history.","seoTitle":"Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. Answers the Proust Questionnaire","seoDescription":"The producer and host of the docuseries Reconstruction: America After the Civil War and author of Stony the Road talks calligraphy, hitchhiking, and history.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","issueDate":"April 2019","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"magazine","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["proust questionnaire","_syndication_noshow"],"revisionAuthor":"Joanna Brenner","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c9bc25197ed21689d12a185","revision":6,"createdAt":"March 27, 2019 2:34 pm","modifiedAt":"March 28, 2019 1:37 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"March 28, 2019 1:37 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Television","slug":"television","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120ae03af0739cf33e2","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-functional-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"_syndication_noshow","slug":"syndication-noshow","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7e17a97170b75493045","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"proust questionnaire","slug":"proust-questionnaire","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb82032b3790c82c9b593","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Vanity Fair","id":"53d70c86db4ec93c547cd568","revision":14,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"December 6, 2016 2:57 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"December 6, 2016 2:57 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"<em>Vanity Fair</em> features in-depth reporting, gripping narratives, and world-class photography, plus heaping doses of Oscar-blogging, royal-watching, and assorted guilty pleasures.

Sorry, but no. You canât have him, because Netflix does. It is holding tight to its homegrown leading man and it is <em>not</em> letting go, casting him in yet anther romantic comedy&#8212;his third for the streamer!&#8212;titled <em>The Perfect Date.</em> In a trailer released Tuesday, Centineo plays Brooks Rattigan (an unbelievable name that should belong to, say, an oft-forgotten Southern cocktail or a special type of golf club), a strapped-for-cash high-schooler who realizes he can make a lot of money by loaning himself out to rich kids who need last-minute dates to things.</p>\n<p>âIâve always wanted to date the most popular girl, drive the nicest car, and go to the fanciest school&#8212;but I canât afford any of that,â he reasons in the beginning of the trailer. That school, by the way, is Yale (<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/defendants-charged-25-million-college-entrance-scam-set/story?id=61910331\">so hot right now</a>). His side-hustle begins when he avails his date services to a rich kid whose cousin doesnât have a date to the semi-formal dance. Itâs a dash of <em>Sheâs All That</em> meets <em>To All the Boys Iâve Loved Before,</em> if <strong>Lana Condorâs</strong> character were paying Centineoâs character lots of dough to be her fake boyfriend. Our boy Brooks Rattigan starts hustling, becoming whichever guy these dates want him to be for the night.</p>\n<p>But of course, his new gig isnât without downsides. His relationship with best friend Murph (<strong>Odiseas Georgiadis</strong>) starts to falter as he gets caught between his old crowd and his wealthy new one, which includes a dalliance with popular girl Shelby Pace (<em>Riverdale</em> royalty <strong>Camila Mendes</strong>). He starts to lose himself in the music, the moment. âIâve been so many people these past few months&#8212;a cowboy, an art connoisseur, and a bad friend,â he mourns. Weâve all been there.</p>\n<p><em>The Perfect Date,</em> set for an April 12 release, is Centineoâs third rom-com with Netflix in under a year, which is somewhat unbelievable (<em>almost</em> as unbelievable as the name Brooks Rattigan). His first turn was in <em>To All the Boys Iâve Loved Before,</em> the zeitgeist-y hit that really cemented his status as a rising star last summer, followed by <em>Sierra Burgess Is a Loser.</em> Thanks to his charm and endless comparisons to a young <strong>Mark Ruffalo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/1106268985438425093\">the Ruff sees it too</a>), Centineo has quickly become the streamerâs latest star.

The young comedian (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/11/pete-davidson-ariana-grande-snl-sketch\">and <strong>Ariana Grande</strong> ex</a>) dropped by the latest <em>Weekend Update</em> to share his thoughts on the difficulty of enjoying <strong>R. Kelly</strong> and other âcanceledâ artists, as well as his latest offscreen romance.</p>\n<p>Davidson opened his appearance on the <strong>Idris Elba</strong>-fronted episode with a caveat on R. Kelly&#8212;whose <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/gayle-king-r-kelly-interview-stephen-colbert\">interview with <strong>Gayle King</strong></a> was also parodied in the cold open. âBefore I continue, this guy is a monster, and he should go to jail forever,â Davidson opined, before taking a controversial turn. âBut . . . if you support the Catholic church, isnât that the same thing as being an R. Kelly fan? I donât really see the difference&#8212;only, like, oneâs music is significantly better.â</p>\n<p>Once the audience seemed to waver, Davidson clarified his point on discredited artists. âIâm not saying itâs an easy decision, Iâm just saying you donât know how good someoneâs music really is until you find out theyâre a pedophile,â he continued. âAnd the reason everybodyâs so upset is because R. Kelly and <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> made great music. If I found out <strong>Macklemore</strong> did some weird stuff, Iâd be happy to free up the space on my iPhone.â</p>\n<p>Davidson suggested a third way: âif you want to listen to their music, you just have to admit that theyâre bad people.â He likened Kellyâs transgressions to the problematic histories of <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2001/08/mark-wahlberg-200108\">Mark Wahlberg</a></strong> or <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/kevin-spacey-lawsuit-malibu\">Kevin Spacey</a></strong>, suggesting âthe rule should be you could appreciate their work, but only if you admit what they did . . . every time any of us listen to a song or watch a movie made by an accused serial predator, you have to give a dollar to a charity that helps sexual assault survivors.â</p>\n<p>Once Davidsonâs point was made, anchor <strong>Colin Jost</strong> turned the discussion toward his co-starâs increasingly publicized love life. Davidson was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/03/pete-davidson-kate-beckinsale-kissing-hockey-game-2019\">recently photographed</a> (and memed) locking lips with actress <strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong>, despite their notable age gap&#8212;25 to her 45. He downplayed the affair, calling attention to a wealth of age differences in celebrity relationships. âIf you have questions about a relationship with a big age difference, just ask <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>, <strong>Jason Statham</strong>, <strong>Michael Douglas</strong>, <strong>Richard Gere</strong>, <strong>Jeff Goldblum</strong>, <strong>Scott Disick</strong>, <strong>Dane Cook</strong>, <strong>Derek Jeter</strong>, <strong>Bruce Willis</strong>, <strong>Harrison Ford</strong>, <strong>Tommy Lee</strong>, <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>, <strong>Sean Penn</strong> and whoever the president of France is, <strong>Mel Gibson</strong>, <strong>Billy Joel</strong>, <strong>Mick Jagger</strong>, <strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>, <strong>Eddie Murphy</strong>, <strong>Kelsey Grammer</strong>, <strong>Larry King</strong>, Larry King, Larry King, <strong>Rod Stewart</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.â</p>\n<p>You can watch the full appearance above.</p>","rubric":"S.N.L.","socialTitle":"Pete Davidson Compares R.

","familyName":"Dimon","bio":"Every crisis needs a white knight, and as the worldâs financial markets melted in the first decade of the 21st century, Jamie Dimon stepped in to fill the role. As head of J.P.Morgan Chase, Dimon hadnât let his firm take on the same level of exposure to subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations as virtually every other firm had. This allowed Dimon to sweep in as both the de facto critic of the industry and its savior. He scooped up Bear Sterns and took over Washington Mutual, saving some 30,000 jobs in the process.\n<p>In some ways, Dimon was destined to fill this seat. Born in Queens to a stockbroker father (and stockbrother grandfathers before him), Dimon and his twin brother studied at Tufts University before Jamie went on to Harvard Business School, where he palled around with Steve Burke and Jeffrey Immelt. Years later, Francis Ford Coppola would call him to have lunch, and he thought it was Burke playing a joke on him. (It was, in fact, Coppola, and the two had a three-hour lunch during which <em>The Godfather</em> director told him he was interested in basing a character on him).</p>\n<p>But when youâre Wall Streetâs golden boy, it stings extra when the narrative shifts in the other direction, as it did in 2012 when the âLondon Whaleâ cost JPMorgan at least $6 billion in trading losses for a series of huge, embarrassingly risky bets that called the bankâs management into question. âWe have egg on our face. We deserve any criticism we get,â Dimon told analysts and the media in a conference call soon after.</p>\n<p>The trading losses were just part of the criticism Dimon and the bank had to field. There was also the $13-billion settlement with federal and state agencies in 2013 over its pre-crisis mortgage practices. And then there was the Dimon family Christmas card in which the executive, his wife, three daughters, and one son-in-law were seen trashing a pristine penthouse with tennis rackets and balls in an artfully-done panoramic shot. After 10 years at the bank, Dimon, who battled throat cancer in 2014, is still one of the most active, and handsomely paid executives on Wall Street. As his bankâs stock struggled in a volatile market in early 2016, he invested $26.6 million of his own fortune into the company&#8212;a vote of confidence when shareholders needed it. The white knight had returned.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574338a4614dc9a45cb0a3c3_hive-contributor-profile-jamie-dimon.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 1:07 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-jamie-dimon.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-jamie-dimon.jpg","credit":"By Laura McDermott/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574338a4c1f81aa45c8117df","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 1:06 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 1:07 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 488776168","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/jamie-dimon","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574338a4614dc9a45cb0a3c3_hive-contributor-profile-jamie-dimon.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 1:07 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-jamie-dimon.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-jamie-dimon.jpg","credit":"By Laura McDermott/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574338a4c1f81aa45c8117df","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 1:06 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 1:07 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 488776168","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"searchable":true,"expired":false,"revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/jamie-dimon","distributionChannels":[{"name":"web-owned-and-operated","metadata":{"searchable":true}}],"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revision":5,"entityId":"573a341eff97be40719753aa"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Early <em>Rocketman</em> Footage Has Hollywood Buzzing","promoHed":"Early <em>Rocketman</em> Footage Has Hollywood Buzzing","dek":"Taron Egerton, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jamie Bell were on hand Monday to introduce 15 minutes from the upcoming Elton John biopic&#8212;which might just be the next <em>Bohemian Rhapsody.</em>","promoDek":"Taron Egerton, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jamie Bell were on hand Monday to introduce 15 minutes from the upcoming Elton John biopic&#8212;which might just be the next <em>Bohemian Rhapsody.</em>","body":"<p>The Troubadour in West Hollywood was packed on Monday night, with <strong>Patrick Stewart, Darren Criss, Diane Warren,</strong> and key Paramount Pictures executives <strong>Jim Gianopulos</strong> and <strong>Wyck Godfrey</strong> turning out to get a glimpse at the upcoming <strong>Elton John</strong> biopic, <em>Rocketman.</em> The only element missing was Elton himself&#8212;though the iconic rock starâs facsimile in the film, <em>Kingsman</em> star <strong>Taron Egerton,</strong> did show up. Egerton was on hand to introduce 15 minutes of footage from the Paramount release to a slew of journalists crowded into the tiny club.</p>\n<p>âHow like the set this is,â said Egerton, hopping onto the stage alongside <strong>Bryce Dallas Howard</strong> (who plays Johnâs mother, Sheila Farebrother, in the film) and <strong>Jamie Bell</strong> (who takes the role of <strong>Bernie Taupin,</strong> Johnâs longtime lyricist and writing partner). âItâs quite strange to be up here not in an outrageous costume.â</p>\n<p>Egerton has shown off his own rock-star swagger before, as when he joined John to perform âTiny Dancerâ at the musicianâs Oscar party last month&#8212;a move that seemed like <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/taron-egerton-elton-john-duet-video-tiny-dancer-rocketman-oscars\">the opening salvo</a> of his own best-actor campaign. Yet he seemed nervous on Monday. Onstage, Egerton was momentarily distracted by the sight of Stewart in the audience. âIâve got a funny feeling I may have peaked,â he said with a laugh, before turning back to the matter at hand: his introduction of the new footage. âI really, really, really hope you like it. Weâve poured everything into it. This is all weâve got.â</p>\n<p>Set to bow on May 31, <em>Rocketman</em> is perfectly positioned to draft off the success of last yearâs <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>, the Queen biopic that landed four Academy Awards&#8212;including the best-actor prize for <strong>Rami Malek</strong>&#8212;and has earned close to $900 million worldwide since it opened last November. The John musical was also directed by <strong>Dexter Fletcher</strong> (<em>Eddie the Eagle</em>), the man who had the dubious honor of finishing <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> after <strong>Bryan Singer</strong> reportedly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/rami-malek-bryan-singer-allegations-not-pleasant\">stopped showing up for work</a>. (Fletcher was stuck in London finishing the film while his cast was promoting it in Los Angeles on Monday.)</p>\n<p>For better or worse, what will likely set <em>Rocketman</em> apart from its lip-syncing cousin is the key fact that in this film, Egerton performs all of Johnâs songs himself. And while Egerton may not be a perfect John soundalike, the early footage indicates that he embodies the icon on a molecular level&#8212;understanding his genius as well as his demons. While this story takes viewers through a typical biopic trajectory&#8212;budding talent, the first taste of success, the eventual downfall&#8212;<em>Rocketman</em> is also unique in that John endorsed the whole enterprise, producing the movie along with his husband, <strong>David Furnish,</strong> and <em>Kingsman</em> franchise director <strong>Matthew Vaughn.</strong> And he did not demand the film shy away from the uglier moments of his history, including his battle with alcohol.</p>\n<p>âI think Elton is in such a good place in his life, where there is so much to celebrate, that [showing] whatever it took to get there could be cathartic,â said Howard in an interview after the footage aired. âBut it does take courage. I think he picked the right people who he trusted. But, come on, weâre talking about Elton John&#8212;of course he had the courage to go there.â</p>\n<p>Egerton tried not to get tripped up by the heady concept of playing an icon while the icon himself was watching. âI think if I spent too much time trying to process the whole situation, and essentially portraying the more turbulent parts of his life, I think I would find the whole thing overwhelming,â he said. âI think Elton is just about as human as they come; his vibrancy, his unbridled creativity, and also his imperfections that he is relentlessly candid about. And by being candid about his peaks and troughs, I think heâs become someone grounded and healed. Because frankly, he used to be someone who wasnât very well.â</p>\n<p>Egerton spent a lot of time with John while preparing for the shoot, visiting him at his English manor in Windsor and even reading Johnâs diaries from the years 1971 to 1976. The actor also recorded âYour Songâ and âDonât Let the Sun Go Down on Meâ at Abbey Road as an audition for the studio. <em>Rocketman</em> became the first movie that head of production Godfrey greenlit as part of the revamped Paramount.</p>\n<p>âFor my part, I tried to fall in love with him as a man, which is not hard. And give the most heartfelt performance that I can,â added Egerton. âAnd try and not have a nervous breakdown.â</p>\n<p>Egerton has also stayed at Johnâs home in L.A. and met his children&#8212;heâs so close to them, he joked, that heâs practically a member of the family. âIf this doesnât work out,â Egerton quipped, âI could be their butler or something.â</p>","rubric":"Musical Theater","socialTitle":"Early Rocketman Footage Has Hollywood Buzzing","socialDescription":"Taron Egerton, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jamie Bell were on hand Monday

Kraft</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bob-kraft-charged-with-soliciting-prostitution\">busted</a> for allegedly soliciting prostitution at a Florida massage parlor last month, the immediate question that popped into everyoneâs brain, given 45âs longtime friendship with Kraft and personal history as a noted sleazebag, was: âHow is <strong>Donald Trump</strong> connected here?â We got our answer just a few short weeks later, when it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/donald-trump-li-yang-robert-kraft-massage-parlor\">emerged</a> that the woman who founded the Orchids of Asia spa, <strong>Li âCindyâ Yang,</strong> was a frequent guest at Mar-a-Lago who spent the Super Bowl with the president and donated more than $16,000 to his campaign. While Yang sold Orchids of Asia prior to the spa being busted as part of an alleged human-trafficking operation, her family <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article227186429.html\">reportedly</a> continues to own other massage parlors that have âgained a reputation for offering sexual services.â (Yang says that she and her family have never broken the law.) The Trump super-fan, meanwhile, reportedly came up with <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/03/a-florida-massage-parlor-owner-has-been-selling-chinese-execs-access-to-trump-at-mar-a-lago/\">an alternative revenue stream</a>: offering access to the entire Trump family and high-ranking administration officials through a business called G.Y. U.S. Investments. And now, Congressional Democrats <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/dems-to-fbi-secret-service-what-do-you-know-about-cindy-yang\">have a few questions</a> theyâd love intelligence agencies and federal law enforcement to answer about Yang and her âapparent relationship with the president.â</p>\n<p>In a letter addressed to the F.B.I., the Secret Service, and the Director of National Intelligence, Representatives <strong>Adam Schiff</strong> and <strong>Jerry Nadler,</strong> along with Senators <strong>Dianne Feinstein</strong> and <strong>Mark Warner,</strong> wrote that they have âserious counterintelligence concernsâ about the fact that an individual who founded a chain of massage parlors âsuspected of involvement in prostitution and human trafficking,â and who reportedly created a business that âmay be selling accessâ to the commander in chief to Chinese clients, has hung out at the presidentâs private Palm Beach club on multiple occasions, visited the White House at least once, and was photographed with Trump at the aforementioned Super Bowl party.</p>\n<p>Prior to the press reporting Yangâs âactivitiesâ and connection to Trump, were intelligence agencies, the Bureau, or Secret Service officials aware of her âties to alleged illicit businesses,â or did they find out about them from the media? Since the revelations about Yang and her interactions with the president, has anyone at the F.B.I. âtaken any steps to investigate potential violations of law or national security vulnerabilitiesâ? Is the president, his campaign, or his political action committee doing anything to âvet donors and determine whether funds are  being contributed illicitly or through straw donorsâ? Who made the guest list for the Super Bowl party and whose idea was it to invite Yang? Is she the only one âoffering foreigners access to the Presidentâ through Mar-a-Lago, or are there others? Does the F.B.I., the Secret Service, or other agencies in the Intelligence Community even vet the foreign nationals that attend Mar-a-Lago events, or vet anyone who shows up to the presidentâs private club for that matter? These are the questions Dems would like answering, by no later than 5 P.M. on March 21, if possible. âAlthough Ms. Yangâs activities may only be those of an unscrupulous actor,â the lawmakers wrote, âher activities also could permit adversary governments or their agents access to [the president and other] politicians to acquire potential material for blackmail or other even more nefarious purposes.â</p>\n<p>Of course, unsaid in the letter is the fact that Mar-a-Lago effectively exists to <em>in order</em> for Trump to sell access to the highest bidder. While paying members have allegedly been given free rein to run <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/three-of-trumps-mar-a-lago-buddies-are-secretly-running-the-va\">at least one government agency</a>&#8212;something agency officials characterized as receiving a âbroad range of inputâ&#8212;others are <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/mar-a-lago-members-trump-presidency\">given a front-row seat to the presidency</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/lana-marks-mar-a-lago-south-africa\">an ambassadorship if they want it</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Auto-union reps not spared from presidentâs weekend of Twitter rage</strong></p>\n<p>Over a 48-hour period in which the leader of the Free World attacked everyone <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/everything-trump-attacked-over-a-wild-weekend-on-twitter.html\">from <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> to John McCain to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> to France</a>, few <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/18/trump-blames-union-leader-gm-job-cuts-ohio-jobs-president-once-vowed-hed-save/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.93e70038785a\">were left unharmed</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>President Trump blamed a small-town union leader Sunday for not doing enough to save a General Motors factory in Lordstown, Ohio, that shuttered on March 6, causing about 5,400 job losses in a struggling part of the country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âDemocrat UAW Local 1112 President <strong>David Green</strong> ought to get his act together and produce.

</iframe></div></div><p><strong>BeyoncÃ©</strong> and <strong>Jay-Z</strong> made an appearance on Thursday night at the 30th Annual GLAAD Media Awards in Los Angeles, where they were both honored for their support of the L.G.B.T.Q. community. At the Beverly Hilton hotel, an emotional BeyoncÃ© dedicated the Vanguard Award to her uncle, Johnny, who died from complications related to HIV. Calling her uncle âthe most fabulous gay man Iâve ever known and ever knew,â the star opened up for the first time about the man who was close with her and <strong>Solange Knowles</strong> when the sisters were growing up in Houston.</p>\n<p>âHe lived his truth,â she said. âHe was brave and unapologetic during a time when this country wasnât as accepting, and witnessing his battle with HIV was one of the most painful experiences Iâve ever lived.â She fought back tears as Jay-Z placed his hand on her back. âIâm hopeful that his struggles started to open pathways for other young people to live more freely. L.G.B.T.Q.I. rights are human rights. To choose who you love is your human right. How you identify and see yourself is your human right. Who you make love to and take that ass to Red Lobster is your human right.â</p>\n<p>BeyoncÃ© ended her speech by personally thanking her husband of nearly 11 years for his work to make the rap industry more inclusive. âI just want to say to you, Jay, Iâm so proud of you for making incredible strides towards changing stigmas in the hip-hop community,â she said. âItâs a privilege to watch you to take those steps and to stand right next to you. I love you.â</p>\n<p>Jay-Z began his speech by thanking his mother, <strong>Gloria Carter,</strong> whom he revealed was a lesbian in his 2017 song âSmile,â GLAAD presented her with a <a href=\"https://www.glaad.org/blog/jay-zs-mom-gloria-carter-accepts-special-recognition-award-robin-roberts-29th-annual-glaad\">special recognition award</a> last year, but Jay-Z was unable to attend the ceremony. Last night, the rapper used his time to acknowledge his mom and said that she taught him the meaning of acceptance.</p>\n<p>âLife is a journey, and is filled with highs, lows, and a lot of learning,â Jay-Z told a crowd that included <strong>Lena Waithe, Jamie Lee Curtis,</strong> and <strong>Allison Janney.</strong> âThis a momentous night and I also want&#8212;cause I didnât get to do it last year&#8212;honor my mother who received an award last year. I get to follow in her footsteps of spreading love and acceptance and her strong message of love&#8212;who you love and the souls that connect to.â</p>\n<p>The <em>RuPaulâs Drag Race</em> alum <strong>Shangela</strong> nearly stole the show by delivering a crowd-pleasing, seven-minute-plus BeyoncÃ© tribute performance, lip-syncing a medley of the pop starâs hit songs and mimicking a few of her well-known moves.</p>\n<p>âIâve already cried and put a run in my stockings from Shangela,â BeyoncÃ© said while collecting her award onstage, as the crowd cheered.</p>\n<p>The nightâs other top honoree was <em>Will &amp; Grace</em> star <strong>Sean Hayes,</strong> who received the Stephen F. Kolzak Award, named after the Los Angeles casting director who devoted his life to fighting homophobia, for his contributions to the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Hayesâs speech included a zinger aimed at  <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/jussie-smollett-update-attack-charges-dropped\"><strong>Jussie Smollett</strong></a>: âIâve been getting in shape for tonight with the Jussie Smollett workout. You hire two trainers and sweat eight weeks,â Hayes quipped, which drew both cheers and jeers from the crowd. âIt wipes out all your belly fat and your credibility.â</p>\n<p><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> presented the outstanding-film award to the teen romantic comedy <em>Love, Simon.</em> The Starzâs television show <em>Vida,</em> won the outstanding-comedy-series award, and the outstanding reality program went to Netflixâs <em>Queer Eye,</em> starring <strong>Bobby Berk, Karamo Brown, Tan France, Antoni Porowski,</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Van Ness.</strong></p>\n<p>âWhen I was growing up, I never imagined being here. I didnât think I would be out of Missouri,â Berk told <em>Vanity Fair</em> on the red carpet. âNot that Missouri is a bad place. Itâs a little bitty town in our day and age. But I grew up very religious. So, itâs an honor and a big deal to be here and celebrate such an amazing night with our peers.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why canât we get <a

Spectrum?","dek":"Hooray&#8212;question mark?","promoDek":"Hooray&#8212;question mark?","body":"<p>In this day and age, any corporate entity can become an original-content platform if it just tries hard enough&#8212;be it an <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/amazon-streaming-budget-netflix-rival\">online retail outfit</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/facebook-watch-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-angel-firefly\">social-media giant</a>, or your neighborhood cable provider. And Wednesday has proven a good day for that last one&#8212;because the <em>Mad About You</em> reunion just landed at Spectrum.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mad-you-reunion-helen-hunt-paul-reiser-lands-at-spectrum-1192694\"><em>The Hollywood Reporter,</em></a> a revival of the NBC sitcom has just joined Charter Communicationsâ budding crop of Spectrum Originals&#8212;a slate that will also include the upcoming <strong>Gabrielle Union</strong>-<strong>Jessica Alba</strong> vehicle, <a href=\"https://www.spectrumoriginals.com/lasfinest/\"><em>L.A.âs Finest.</em></a> The show is currently set to debut later this year as a limited series.</p>\n<p>Both of the showâs original stars, <strong>Paul Reiser</strong> and <strong>Helen Hunt,</strong> will return to play married couple Paul and Jamie Buchman, while <strong>Peter Tolan</strong> (<em>The Larry Sanders Show</em>) will come aboard as show-runner. All three will executive produce the show, with <em>Mad About You</em> co-creator <strong>Danny Jacobson</strong> signing on as an executive consultant. The original series, which documented the romantic trials and tribulations of a newlywed couple, ran for seven seasons before it ended in 1999. Hunt, whose performance earned her four consecutive outstanding-lead-actress-in-a-comedy-series Emmys, is set to direct the reunionâs premiere.</p>\n<p>Spectrumâs head of original content, <strong>Katherine Pope,</strong> said in a statement that the team was thrilled to bring back <em>Mad About You.</em> âTwo decades ago, fans fell in love with this show, and this time will be no different as Paul, Helen, and Peter explore modern marriage through the eyes of two people who have just become empty-nesters,â Pope said. âWe canât wait for everyone to fall in love with the Buchmans all over again.ââ</p>\n<p>News of <em>Mad About You</em>âs impending return first broke <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/12/mad-about-you-paul-reiser-helen-hunt-revival/\">last spring</a>, but as <em>T.H.R.</em> reports, the revival struggled to find a home before Spectrum picked it up. Its landing spot means the showâs return is likely to make far fewer waves than some of its contemporaries, such as <em>Will &amp; Grace,</em> which enjoyed a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/will-and-grace-revival-season-9-premiere-ratings\">massive premiere</a> in 2017&#8212;before reboot-mania petered out&#8212;and ABCâs <em>Roseanne</em> reboot, which went on to become the No. 1 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/roseanne-number-one-television-show-2018\">show</a> of the year despite, or perhaps because of, all the controversy that surrounded it. Since then, however, things have begun to slow down, with <em>The Conners</em> drawing in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/the-conners-premiere-ratings-roseanne-barr\">respectable</a>, if less impressive, ratings, and series including CBSâs <em>Murphy Brown</em> revival underperforming. The announcement at the end of January that Netflixâs <em>Fuller House,</em> one of the first entries into the revival craze, had been renewed for <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/01/fuller-house-end-renewed-fifth-final-season-netflix-1202546263/\">its last season</a> seemed to mark the end of an era of sorts&#8212;adding yet one more reason not to expect too much of a frenzy around <em>Mad About You.</em></p>\n<p>But this reunion also drives home another factor: the absolute fragmentation of the content sphere. At this point, the <em>BoJack Horseman</em> story line in which a Web site called âwhattimeisitrightnow.comâ becomes a hub for original programming seems even less absurd than it did when Season 5 of that series launched last year (on Netflix, a company originally founded to send DVDs through the mail). At this point, any corporation with deep pockets can get into the content game&#8212;and while this is far from news, the fact that a classic NBC sitcom has landed with a cable provider does drive home how far that craze has gone better than just about anything else.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/10-undeniable-facts-about-the-michael-jackson-sexual-abuse-allegations?inline\">10 undeniable facts</a> about Michael Jacksonâs sexual abuse allegations</p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/bob-greenblatt-hbo-plepler-battle-with-netflix?inline\">new HBO</a>&#8212;and its coming battle with Netflix</p>\n<p>&#8212; <em>Captain Marvel</em> is a period piece, a space adventure, and an attempt at feminist filmmaking&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/captain-marvel-movie-review?inline\">and, our critic writes, it mostly succeeds</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Thought <em>Borat</em> was daring?

At the time, just a year before 9/11, pop music might have been at its creative nadir, the Billboard charts painted with a tableau of barely-remembered artists who couldnât be bothered by political commentary: <strong>SisqÃ³,</strong> Creed, <strong>Rob Thomas</strong> and <strong>Santana,</strong> Savage Garden, and various musicians who wore carpenter jeans and frosted tips. Rage wasnât playing that game. The nation was slouching toward a showdown between <strong>George W. Bush</strong> and <strong>Al Gore,</strong> two white men in suits racing to the mushy middle.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Michael Moore</strong> directing, Rage used their video to hammer Bush and Gore as two sides of the same centrist coin, a pair of incrementalist politicians beholden to a corrupt system that favored Wall Street billionaires and entrenched-power elites. Given the history that would unfold in the coming years across the Levant, it was a facile argument in hindsight. But politics at that time, before the World Trade Center fell, was defined by complacency and disinterest. Rage declared their answer to this broken system at the conclusion of their music video for âTestifyâ: an endorsement of <strong>Ralph Nader,</strong> the consumer-rights advocate and Green Party nominee who proclaimed that, âIf youâre not turned onto politics, politics will turn on you.â Other celebrities at the time, like <strong>Susan Sarandon, Eddie Vedder,</strong> and <strong>Ben Harper,</strong> lined up behind Nader. He would go on to win 2.8 million votes, only a slice of the national count. But Nader had enough cultural buzz and disaffected supporters on the left to capture almost 100,000 votes in Florida, tipping the presidency in Bushâs direction with an assist from <strong>Pat Buchanan.</strong></p>\n<p>Almost 20 years later, another third-party spoiler has entered the presidential fray. His name is <strong>Howard Schultz,</strong> the self-made billionaire founder of Starbucks. No one, however, will be making a music video about Howard Schultz. Politicians only seep into pop culture when they inspire people, and Schultz, with his hand-gesturing boardroom speak and glaring lack of agenda, is so far only inspiring rage tweets from Democrats who donât want him to help <strong>Donald Trump</strong> get re-elected. That isnât stopping Schultz from moving forward. In a Medium <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Howardschultz/ourpath-9164e18bdb98\">post</a> published Tuesday, Schultz wrote that he feels âa deep responsibility and moral obligation to address Americansâ frustrations with our broken two-party system.â Despite the criticisms, he wrote, âIâm excited to keep the conversation going,â the ultimate piece of charmless corporate jargon.</p>\n<p>But Tuesday brought another piece of news that reminds us why Schultz faces such long odds if he chooses to run: the entrance of <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> into the Democratic presidential race. As Sanders and Trump demonstrated in 2016, insurgent politics today is practiced inside the contours of the two-party system, not outside of it. In an era of extreme partisanship, all of the action in American politics, the darkness and the fun alike, is taking place inside the tents of the two major parties. Whether Sanders can fully realize his presidential ambitions the second time around is an open question. But Sanders knows that as much as people loathe the two political parties, those parties also remain the two most important vehicles in the war for power and ideas in 2020. Itâs an essential truth about our moment that could leave Schultz out in the cold, hoping to pay off the bouncer to get in to the party.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Given their behavior and tactics to date, Sanders and Schultz, two boys from Brooklyn, are gambling with two very different theories about politics. Both theories have their limits, but Sanders seems to have a better understanding of the state of play as the curtain rises on the 2020 presidential race. Schultz, if he runs, appears to be campaigning from the inside out, a fully-realized American power elite portraying himself as a truth-telling outsider. His media strategy from the get-go seemed the very definition of Amtrak-corridor conventional: a book tour, a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, sit-downs with <em>Morning Joe</em> and the <em>Goop</em> podcast. None of it screamed populist. As he stepped out into the public crossfire, Schultz wasnât talking about his rags-to-riches story or his admirable efforts to bring health care to thousands of low-wage earners. Instead, he was lashing both parties for abandoning the centrist impulses of the âsilent majorityâ&#8212;a plurality, if anything&#8212;that was predictably silent when the Twitter mobs immediately came for his head.</p>\n<p>Schultz has a right to tell his story and deserves not to be dismissed out of hand simply because he is a billionaire. The angry question of âWhat have you ever done?â thrown at Schultz by the online hordes can be equally applied to any number of backbencher politicians and professional activists who are here for the re-tweets. But Schultz misfired by broaching the idea of a third-party candidacy at a time when the public is questioning the very idea of whether billionaires should exist. Those criticisms might have been blunted had he brought a big idea or two to the table. <strong>Ross Perot</strong> and Nader both had proactive agendas and passionate pet issues that defined their candidacies, which didnât rest solely on trashing their opponents. As a consequence, both Perot and Nader managed to have an outsized impact with voters despite the electoral futility of their campaigns. Schultz, instead, has been little more than a scold, chiding the very politicians who are bringing actual ideas to the table.</p>\n<p>Schultzâs other big mistake was suggesting a third-party bid, claiming a hunger in the country for something other than the menu offerings from Democrats and Republicans. It is true that roughly a third of the country identifies as moderate, according to a recent Pew survey, suggesting a lane for Schultz (or his political consultants). But what Schultz seems not to understand is that in an era of partisan sorting, moderates, too, are choosing sides. For the most part, they are drifting into the Democratic Party, which recaptured the House of Representatives last November not because of firebrand liberals like <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</strong> but on the backs of suburban moderates hailing from places like Orange County and central Virginia. Moderates do have power. At the moment, theyâre just choosing to vote Democrat in opposition to President Trump. Whatâs more, the idea that registered partisans might abandon their party in the ballot box in favorite of a sensible moderate is increasingly quaint. As the political scientist <strong>Lee Drutman</strong> has written, partisan identity in the age of Trump is much more closely aligned with social and cultural identity. That lends a more intense meaning to your partisan jersey, red team or blue. Common ground is much more difficult to locate outside of the two parties. If Schultz wanted an honest hearing at a time of deep partisan divide, the Democratic primary would have been the most logical place for it. Followed, of course, by a CNN town hall.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>While Schultz runs from the inside out, Sanders seems to be reprising the strategy that almost got him to the pinnacle in 2016, running from the outside in, a people-powered ideologue gunning to take over a Democratic Party that still regards him with suspicion. The very fact that Sanders was not fully accepted into the ranks of the Democratic establishment is one source of his appeal.</p>\n<p>Sanders might be 77 years old and âsalty as ever,â as CNNâs <strong>Kate Bolduan</strong> said on-air Tuesday after his announcement, but heâs still a central figure in the dialectic of the Democratic Party, its most uncompromising ideological figure, and best fund-raiser. Like Trump, Sanders didnât get there by climbing the ladder in Washington like his fellow senators now in the presidential race; he did it by tapping into common-sense ideas about economic fairness and raising oceans of small-donor cash online in the process. He delivered his message using non-traditional media and waited for the green-room journalism crowd to catch up. A democratic socialist, Sanders might have chosen to run in 2016 as a third-party liberal in the mold of Nader. But instead, he smartly decided to disrupt the Democratic Party from the inside by seeking its presidential nomination, all while never calling himself a Democrat. Sanders became the liberal folk hero of the last campaign, the subject of graffiti murals, hipster endorsements, and D.I.Y. merch, the cool grassroots signifiers that swirled around Nader a decade and a half earlier.</p>\n<p>While Sanders lost to <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> his failed campaign nevertheless established his place in the political firmament. Today, as he embarks on a new race, his signature issues are now key touchstones in the Democratic primary. When his rivals tip-toe around their commitment to Medicare for all, a new minimum wage, and free college education, Sanders will be right there holding their feet to the fire. And as curmudgeonly as Sanders seems, he also likes the attention from a mainstream press that ignored him for so many decades, which is why he could barely conceal his smiles during his announcement interview with <strong>John Dickerson</strong> on <em>CBS This Morning.</em> Sanders canât wait to go back on <em>Ellen</em> and hang out with <strong>Killer Mike.</strong> He is able to do all of these things precisely because he isnât a creature of the Democratic establishment&#8212;because he is disruptive and refuses to play by the rules. So why not run it back in 2020?</p>\n<p>Sandersâs biggest failure in 2016 was not building coalitions. He found it difficult to expand his reach beyond liberals, white workers, and young people, to win over the older women and African-Americans who eventually gave their votes to Clinton. But on CBS, Sanders told Dickerson that unlike in 2016, he can plausibly win the nomination without cobbling together a majority of Democrats. âIn some ways it makes it easier,â Sanders said. âWhen youâre running against one person you know you gotta have 51 percent of the votes. Now who knows what you need? Thirty, thirty-five percent?â</p>\n<p>That may come to pass: Trump slowly grew his campaign throughout the Republican primaries when many pundits expected him to top out around 25 percent. But just as Republicans donât behave as Democrats, Democrats donât behave as Republicans. The impulses and issue sets are different, and Sanders has yet to convince Democrats beyond his base of economic progressives that he cares deeply about the plight of immigrants, criminal-justice reform, and the white-hot cultural issues that are roiling our politics under Trump. It would be glib, though, to suggest Sanders hasnât learned from his mistakes. He has a chance to convince Democrats heâs evolved, even if Democrats now have many more choices than they did when it was just Bernie versus Hillary all day every day.</p>\n<p>Sandersâs outsider patina gave him power in 2016 and it will again in this campaign. But he can no longer wield the element of surprise. Sanders made plenty of enemies in the Democratic Party, in and around Clintonâs campaign specifically. There are legions of well-connected Democrats who do not like Sanders and would rather he spend the rest of his days slurping down Ben &amp; Jerryâs in Burlington. They will plant negative stories about him, steer money to other candidates, puff up his rivals, and happily let him twist in the wind when he stumbles. Those things might not matter to his die-hard supporters, but every successful Democratic nominee after <strong>Jimmy Carter</strong> played nice with party insiders in pursuit of the ring. Even <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> has met with <strong>Jamie Dimon.</strong></p>\n<p>Sanders seems like heâd rather watch a 10-hour <em>Bachelor</em> marathon, <em>Clockwork Orange</em>&#8211;style, than do the same. He is permanently averse to playing the inside political game, gabbing with power brokers on the phone, or charming the media off-the-record. His sequel campaign will test whether those choices matter anymore, whether big speeches, lofty policy ideas, and social media alone can carry the day. This might be a Very <strong>Bill Simmons</strong> Hot Take, but Sanders is the <strong>James Harden</strong> of politics. Heâll get you 30 points a night, but itâs hard to see how he wins a championship without getting his teammates involved. Either way, heâll still be in the conversation.</p>\n<p><em>Peter Hamby is the host of Snapchatâs</em> Good Luck America.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"The Bernie Conundrum: Can âSalty as Everâ Sanders Be a Real 2020 Player?","socialDescription":"Whether Sanders can fully realize his presidential ambitions the second time around is an open question.

Kevin Sessums reports in <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs July 1992 cover story.","body":"<p>Luke Perry, whose character Dylan McKay takes his Porsche out for a testosterone drive Thursday nights on <em>Beverly Hills, 90210,</em> has become a touchstone for the American public: heâs Everyteen, a youngster who, growing up quite cognizant of the frightening age in which he lives&#8212; AIDS, drugs, family, and now urban, violence&#8212;retains not only a cool resolve but also a cooler integrity. He does all the wrong things for all the right reasons.</p>\n<p>I had arranged to meet Perry by the pool at the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel on what turned out to be the first full day of the recent riots in Los Angeles, and the incongruity of the situation was inescapable. <em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em> has codified a kind of Caucasian chic for the 1990s, and here he was, in a backward baseball cap, lunching under an umbrella, while smoke drifted overhead from the fires that had erupted the night before. Japanese teenagers were frolicking around us in chlorined serenity as Perry squinted up at the darkening sky. âSo what are the ground rules here?â he asked.</p>\n<p>âThere arenât any. You can trust me.â</p>\n<p>âYeah. Right.â</p>\n<p>âHow old are you?â</p>\n<p>âA woman from <em>Rolling Stone</em> asked me that once, and I said, âIâll tell you, but then Iâll have to kill you.â â A Japanese teenager squealed as her boyfriend threw her in the pool. âIâm twenty-five.â</p>\n<p>Though Perry, an Ohio farm boy, convincingly portrays a rather jaded junior Beverly Hills denizen in <em>90210,</em> in person he seems ill at ease in these surroundings. He wanted to talk about what was going on down in South-Central L.A. and how on some absurd level it connected to the extreme popularity of his show. âI think society has become oppressive in a lot of ways, and weâre a good outlet for all of that. I mean, that shit downtown is a perfect example. There are a lot of pent-up frustrations down there. This ainât all about one thing: Rodney King. Itâs symbolic: weâre living in a society thatâs getting out of control. I donât think it is a race issue&#8212;on some level certainly it is, but I saw white people down there screaming last night. I saw Hispanics. I saw Asians. I saw blacks. There were gays. There were straights. If nothing else, I see some beauty in whatâs happening. Youâve got people you would ordinarily never see together. It inspired a passion in them.... Itâs unfortunate that it had to be something bad like that, but I think thereâs a little bit of good in that, too,â he theorized. âLook, weâve just come out of the justsay-no phase. Say no to everything. Itâs too bad that they didnât limit that to just drugs. They wanted people to say no to everything fun. Well, on <em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em> weâre saying, Just say maybe.â He gave it all a shrug, and looked right at me. âYou know, <em>Just say maybe.â</em></p>\n<p>Fox Inc.âs ex-chairman, Barry Diller, who founded the Fox network and grew up in Beverly Hills himself, had harbored for some time the concept of a television show set in an idealized version of Beverly Hills High School. Diller and the president of the Fox Entertainment Group, Peter Chernin, teamed up then twenty-eight-year-old screenwriter Darren Star and veteran producer Aaron Spelling to create the showâs pilot, about the Walshes, a Minnesota family (accountant father, empathic mother, sexy teenage fraternal twins Brenda and Brandon) that moves to this enclave, where bank accounts are as vulgarly displayed as cleavage. Later, to ensure a politically correct point of view, they brought in <em>Northern Exposureâs</em> supervising producer, writer Charles Rosin. The rest is teen-angst history.</p>\n<div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span><blockquote>\n<p>The Museum of Television &amp; Radio chose the showâs âcondom distributionâ episode to be included in its permanent collection.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n</span><div class=\"component-social-share pullquote mono closed\" data-component=\"SocialShare\" role=\"list\"><div class=\"share-item twitter\" data-component=\"twitter\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0AThe%20Museum%20of%20Television%20%26amp%3B%20Radio%20chose%20the%20show%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Ccondom%20distribution%E2%80%9D%20episode%20to%20be%20included%20in%20its%20permanent%20collection.%E2%80%8B%0A%0A%22&amp;via=VanityFair&amp;url=\" role=\"listitem\"><a aria-label=\"Tweet\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0AThe%20Museum%20of%20Television%20%26amp%3B%20Radio%20chose%20the%20show%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Ccondom%20distribution%E2%80%9D%20episode%20to%20be%20included%20in%20its%20permanent%20collection.%E2%80%8B%0A%0A%22&amp;via=VanityFair&amp;url=\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"icon\"></span><span class=\"label\">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p>The show has become more than a hit series; it is a social phenomenon of worldwide proportions. The cast of characters&#8212;which includes Spellingâs daughter, Tori, as Donna, Shannen Doherty as Brenda, Ian Ziering as Steve, Gabrielle Carteris as Andrea, Brian Austin Green as David, Jennie Garth as Kelly, and Jason Priestley as Brandon&#8212;has formed into a cluster of fame with the following of a championship sports team. âAs an actor on a show that has become successful, you try not to associate the word âphenomenonâ with what youâre doing. Thatâs a label the media has placed on our show,â says Priestley, who is the neo-nice-guy hunk in the cast. âWhen <em>Cheers</em> went to number one, it wasnât a phenomenon; it was just a good show. Weâve been attacked with this stigma. As actors, that can be so detrimental to your career.â</p>\n<p><em>âBeverly Hills, 90210</em> is a tribute to clear skin. You get the feeling that if one of those girls got a pimple sheâd go into a tailspin,â says <em>Vanity Fairâs</em> media critic James Wolcott. âThe show is the last outpost of American privilege. It is an ad for consumerism and status. Even the extras are great-looking.â</p>\n<p>The series is now seen in almost twenty countries, and is nearly as popular in Great Britain and Australia as it is here. The first fan letters from Russia&#8212; sixty-four of them&#8212;recently arrived, asking <em>90210âs</em> creators, âHow did you know us so well?â In Spain a few months ago, two of the lesser-known characters made front-page news upon their arrival at the Madrid airport; reporters compared the hysteria that resulted to the Beatlesâ first visit three decades ago. Yet it is in America that the <em>90210</em> onslaught continues to percolate most strongly. The Museum of Television &amp; Radio recently chose the showâs âcondom distributionâ episode to be included in the museumâs permanent collection, and even hosted a screening for Hollywoodâs movers and shakers at the L.A. County Museum of Art. Moreover, the showâs fans span everyone from hip-hype author Bret Easton Ellis, who admitted to Darren Star at dinner one night that he was a secret Thursday-night addict, to the hopeful young Long Island girl who sent an elaborately large Bas Mitzvah invitation to the cast, begging in a handwritten note for at least one of them to show up for the occasion&#8212;as if they were all actually her friends.</p>\n<p>Audiences have traveled quite a distance from Wilderâs <em>Our Town</em> to this even wilder address. Or have they?</p>\n<p>Diller: âI always thought a serial-like series about Beverly Hills High was a great idea, because I thought it was a small town in both its sensibilities and borders&#8212;<em>very</em> small-town&#8212;while at the same time it was, after all, Beverly Hills. In terms of what that meant growing up there, it was a very interesting thing in that you were both inside a small town and at the same time enormously sophisticated. So I thought that every issue was always going on at multiple levels.... I thought, What an interesting arena for storytelling&#8212;on one hand very accessible, because all of these teenage problems are, of course, the same, and on the other hand very much an interesting world, because of its Beverly Hills-ness. What I did not realize was just how much those forces, when allowed to cook, would end up being so much about family as they ended up being, because, after all, that is the nature of a small town. It has nothing to do with show business or promoting the thing. Thatâs just the carny barker outside the tent getting you into the tent. Once youâre in the tent, you go, âOh my God! You mean this is really about <em>families?â</em> This is about <em>family values,</em> but from all different aspect ratios. Seven or eight weeks into the show, just watching the episodes, it became clear that this was what these shows were about. They dealt with these issues, but they did it without condescension to the children. The thing that you got out of it, that you valued, was this: this is a family groping with contemporary life. Thatâs why itâs absolutely caught on. Thatâs completely why. <em>It honorably and honestly grew.</em>â</p>\n<p>Luke Perry grew up fiercely independent. His family moved from one small Ohio farm town to another, finally settling in Fredericktown, population 2,300, about an hourâs drive from Columbus. It was an existence as alien from Dylan McKayâs on <em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em> as one could have, and explains the âoutsiderâ quality that is as important to McKayâs appeal as is the freedom inherent in the characterâs immense wealth. McKay is a recovering alcoholic, an emancipated seventeen-year-old worth $100 million. (This is the amount left after his father was hauled off to jail for insider trading; his mother, played by British actress Stephanie Beacham, lives in Hawaii.) Dylan was originally supposed to reside in the Beverly Wilshire, âlike Warren Beatty,â according to Star, who is credited with creating the characters for the show. âI thought there was something kind of sad and exciting at the same time,â Star says, âabout this world-weary guy who lives in this hotel and goes to high school, but we didnât really play the hotel bit that much.â</p>\n<p>Perryâs mother divorced his late father when Perry was six. âHe was violent,â Perry admits. âHe was a drunk. He treated my mother very poorly. Had I been big enough at the time, I would have beat his ass. But I wasnât. So I always felt that I should have been able to protect her better, but I was a six-year-old kid. Thatâs where my frustration stems from. I saw very clearly as a six-year-old kid what the problems were. Looking back at it all now, it was pretty frightening. I try to reiterate to these people writing the show that these kids ainât stupid. They see. They know. âDonât be afraid to talk to them about real issues on a real level, because they are fucking way ahead of you.â I was way ahead of them. I saw what was going on. I knew what was happening as much as they tried to shelter me from it. I was <em>aware.â</em><br>\nPerryâs mother is amazed by the celebrity her son has attained. Last Christmas, local police had to be called to clear away the dozens of fans and photographers collecting on her front lawn, hoping Luke was there. (He had already been and gone.) âMomâs tough,â Perry says. âSheâs a fighter. Her life ainât been easy, but she donât walk around with her heart on her sleeve. She stuck it out. She never bailed.â She remarried when Perry was twelve, and he is close to his stepfather, as well as to his older brother, a navy recruiter in Illinois, and his sister, a secretary in her early twenties.</p>\n<p>Perry never made it to college, didnât even do well in high school. (His only honor was being voted âBiggest Flirt.â) He admits he wasnât a great student, spending much of his time in search of outlets for his creative spirit. He once played the âFreddie Birdâ mascot for the football team, and had his stepfatherâs construction company provide a helicopter so that he could land unannounced on the high-school playing field and emerge to the sound of the crowdâs roar in his yellow tights, webbed feet, and bright-red plumage. Another time, he sprang one of his friends from detention by donning a ski mask and pulling a fake gun on the elderly secretary in charge.<br>\nâI felt like <em>another</em>,â Perry says of his time growing up in Ohio, which he left when he was only seventeen. âIt was never about escape. It was aoout wanting to feel like I belonged. I felt like I belonged on a screen. I donât know why. I guess because I related to the people up on that screen much more than the people around me. I always felt like I was one of them and in a matter of time Iâd get there.â</p>\n<p>Perryâs first stop was Los Angeles, where he had no luck. He then headed for New York and shared an apartment in Harlem ten minutes from Yankee Stadium with Rocky Carroll, now one of the stars of another Fox show, <em>Roc.</em> He finally landed a recurring role on the ABC daytime soap <em>Loving,</em> and then a second on the NBC soap <em>Another World.</em></p>\n<p>One of the people who befriended him early on in his career was Alexa Fogel, now the director of prime-time casting for ABC. After Perry appeared on <em>Loving,</em> he realized he still had a lot to learn about his craft as well as about show business itself, and between his many construction jobs he enrolled in Fogelâs audition-workshop class. âThe one thing that has always been true about Luke, ever since I first met him, when he was around twenty years old, is that heâs always wanted to get better and better,â says Fogel. âConsidering the fact that heâd already been on a soap and gotten a certain amount of attention for that, I think thatâs quite commendable. ... He walks towards that: his commitment to always better himself. Thereâs nothing confrontational about him. He wants to hear how he can get better. He wants to see it. He doesnât have a chip on his shoulder. He never has.â</p>\n<p>With a bit of money in his pocket, Perry moved back to L.A., but again he couldnât find work, so he laid asphalt for a living. He had met another young actor, Alexis Arquette, on a forgettable movie they made in South Carolina, and he moved in with the Arquette acting clan&#8212; Alexis, David, Rosanna, Richmond, Mardi, Lewis, and Patricia, whom he fell for immediately. âWhen I couldnât keep my head above water, they helped me,â he says.</p>\n<p>Perry admits that he feels truly at home only âany place that Iâm alone.â He is never <em>really</em> alone, for he has frequently shared his mattress with girlfriends. His regular bedmate is his pet Vietnamese potbellied pig, named Jerry Lee. âWhen I was little,â he remembers, âmy uncle had a litter of pigs, and the little one, the runt. . .well, the mother rolled over on it and broke its back legs. We had to keep it in the house. And, you know, you just hold it,â he says, and in the reflection from the Beverly Wilshireâs pool mimes cuddling the tiny thing. âIt was beautiful. Pigs are very sweet. There is intelligence in their eyes. Jerry Leeâs great. Heâs been a calming influence on me. I just got a baby. Sheâs a little girl. He still thinks sheâs lunch&#8212;he tries to eat her. Violet is her name. Sheâs a movie star.â</p>\n<p>âHe instantly became the handyman,â Alexis Arquette says, remembering Perryâs time in his familyâs home. âHe knew about all this menial shit. Now heâs doing his own backyard at his new house. Heâs not paying some contractor. He goes and gets his own bulldozer and drives it around himself. Heâs very the jack-of-alltrades. . . . Iâm not surprised by his celebrity at all. I knew he was bound for it. The moment he stumbled into our wayward little home, he was putting on a show the whole time. Heâs always entertaining. Even when heâs in a bad mood, heâs entertaining. Itâs always fun to hang out with him. Even when we didnât have any money, weâd just do fun stuff. Weâd go camping with his pig or go do these big jumps in a four-wheel-drive truck out in the desert. Weâd jump off these huge dunes, bottoming out the truck. When the pig was a little baby, it would ride in the front seat with us on these jumping expeditions. That pig would be, like, <em>airborne.</em> It looked like we were on the space shuttle for a second, because the pig was just floating counterclockwise. It was beautiful. Luke loves doing mad, crazy shit like that.â</p>\n<p>âLuke is very campy,â says Howard Rosenman, co-producer of Perryâs new film, <em>Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,</em> a comedy with a feminist twist, which opens at the end of this month. Co-starring Donald Sutherland, Rutger Hauer, Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee-wee Herman), and Perryâs good friend Kristy Swanson, as Buffy, the film was directed by <em>Tokyo Popâs,</em> director and onetime Keith Haring protegee, Fran Kuzui. âHeâs got a great sense of humor,â Rosenman continues. âHe has the humor of his generation, really. This project has been very interesting for me, because around him there is this whole bunch of people that are like satellites. Itâs true stardom. There are all these acolyte best friends. It reminds me of Sean Penn and the Brat Pack. But this is the next generation. On the set every single night, all these young, happening kids&#8212;Balthazar Getty and guys like that&#8212;would show up.â</p>\n<p>One night during the filming, Robert Downey Jr. was introduced to Perry. Downey had recently returned from England, where he was playing Charlie Chaplin in Sir Richard Attenboroughâs film <em>Charlie.</em> âSo youâre The Guy now,â Downey told him. Perry was confused, and asked him what he meant. âYouâre The Guy,â he reiterated. âYou know, the one that everyone is talking about&#8212;all the directors, all the producers, all the girls.â<br>\nPerry shrugged.</p>\n<p>âGet over it,â Downey wisely suggested, and they both laughed at the fickleness of it all.<br>\nAnybody who hangs out with drag queens is a friend of mine!â Madonna says of her new pal Perry, one of whose best friends is a renowned L.A. female impersonator, Eva Destruction. (In fact, Perry was up for the part of Georgette, the flamboyant homosexual in <em>Last Exit to Brooklyn,</em> and says he went to several auditions in full drag.)</p>\n<p>Eva whoops with delight when I tell âherâ what Madonna said. âOh my <em>God,</em> Madonna just read me! Madonna read me in <em>Vanity Fair.</em> Letâs just say anybody who can go on a date with Madonna and not end up in bed with her, I have respect for,â Eva says, certifying close friend Perry as the roughneck gentleman he is.<br>\nMadonna met Perry a few months ago, at the Beverly Wilshire hotel. She was to receive an award from the American Foundation for AIDS Research in the hotelâs ballroom, and Elizabeth Taylor was scheduled to present it. Taylor, however, came down with the flu, and the day before the event AmFAR asked Madonna whom she wished to be Taylorâs replacement. Madonna took the opportunity to meet the nationâs newest heartthrob. She picked up the phone herself and called Perry on the set of <em>90210</em> to ask if heâd fill in. Perry at first thought it was a friend playing a practical joke on him, but was finally convinced that it was not a crank call. (âI know the food chain in Hollywood,â says Perry, âand letâs just say I donât come directly under Elizabeth Taylor.â) Like almost everyone else, Perry was unable to say no to Madonna; he agreed to show up at the benefit after he opened that same night in the play <em>Love Letters</em> with Amanda Donohoe from <em>L.A. Law.</em> Madonna greeted him onstage with a full lip lock, and there have been romantic rumors about the two ever since.</p>\n<div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span><blockquote>\n<p>âIf they want John Wayne, I can give them John Wayne.

I donât care if theyâre black. I donât care if theyâre black and gay and a drag queen.... If they inspire me, those are the people I want around. It took me a while to make that adjustment.â</p>\n<p>What he has never had to adjust to is his ability to get along with women. Perry has always had a respect and an abiding love for them. Though heâs ânot fucking around these days, because I got a girlâ (one he keeps a secret because she has nothing to do with show business), he does theorize on why heâs so successful sexually. âWhat Iâve found is that Iâm very in touch with my feminine side,â he says in his distinctively soft, corduroy cadences. âI ainât got no problem saying that. Any good actor is. And any good lover is. Meaning that women donât always want to be manhandled. A lot of times they want to be made love to by a man who can do it softly, like a woman. Iâve found this to be very true. Freud said that everyone has latent homosexual tendencies. I believe they are not so deep with women. Women by nature are more affectionate. They are more physical. They are more motherly. Iâm kinda like that, too. ... They can talk to me about a lot of different things. I think that that is one of the things that they find appealing about me.... If they want John Wayne, I can give them John Wayne. But most women want a little more&#8212;someone who has some sensitivity, whoâll take some time.â Perry pauses. âThere are a lot of times that people will misconceive me as being gay when they first meet me.â<br>\nHas he ever experimented sexually with another guy?</p>\n<p>âFlat out on the record? I never have. Iâve been singularly heterosexual my whole life. So big deal. Most people have. But to not recognize that there is some homosexual element out there is ridiculous. And donât recognize them as some scourge. But see them for what they have to give as people before you define them by their sexuality. Especially in show business: itâs a fag-o-rama! The gay people who bother me are the ones who are offended that you take notice that they are gay. To me, it should be as open to conversation as anything else. But because Iâm the handsome leading man, everybody wants to get in my closet and find out Iâve been a fag. ... I can understand why Tom Selleck sued the <em>Globe.</em> Because thatâs business. People think Tom Selleckâs gay, then theyâre not going to be showing up to see his movies. They just took a lot of money out of his pocket. They have no right to do that simply on conjecture. If they have facts, if they have pictures of me fucking some guy, fine&#8212; then they can say whatever they want.â</p>\n<p>âI am product! Hear me roar!â Perry exclaims facetiously at one point, carrying his Selleck argument to its logical conclusion. He is so much a product, in fact, that he has become betting material. Over a meal, Madonna and Barry Diller wagered a cool million that Perry was only five feet nine inches tall. Their dinner partners, David Geffen and Sandy Gallin, bet them he was taller. Perry claims to be five feet ten. ââI thought he was small and powerful,â Madonna says. âI guess heâs medium and powerful.â She fully intends to pay up her share of the wager. ââWell, I donât,â says Diller. âI profoundly donât. Talk about coals to Newcastle.â</p>\n<p>Perry can joke about his role as a piece of male merchandise, but he refuses to be used. On the second day of the L.A. riots, he was on his way to Warner Bros, to have a meeting about a film heâs interested in making. Driving to the lot, he got a call informing him that Warnerâs, like other studios in town, had closed early because of the possible danger from the riots. But since he was already on his way to Warnerâs, one of his agents from CAA asked him if he wouldnât appear at the âWalls of Justiceâ press conference, which was scheduled to take place shortly on the lot. He immediately agreed, and arrived to find Wesley Snipes, Anjelica Huston, Sean Penn, Joel Silver, Richard Donner, and an assortment of other concerned inside-Hollywood types gathered to voice their opposition to the Rodney King verdict and plead for calm. Organized by the Hollywood Policy Center, and involving CAA, the Hollywood Womenâs Political Committee, and other political and entertainment interests, the event walked a dangerous line between social activism and a photo op. Perry was well aware of this line, and he exited the press conference when he overheard publicists on the telephone telling their clients that they better get down to the Warnerâs lot, because the group had turned out to be Alist after all.</p>\n<p><em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em> has been an A-list hit for only a little more than a year, but Fox and Aaron Spelling, whose company produces the show, are cashing in. This month brings not only new summer episodes of the Thursday-night drama but also the first episodes of <em>90210âs</em> spin-off, <em>Melrose Place,</em> on Wednesday nights. If <em>90210</em> is <em>teensomething,</em> then <em>Melrose</em> will be <em>twenty something.</em> Down the road, when the <em>90210</em> characters go off to Southern California colleges, Spelling tells me, he has plans for yet another spinoff, with a younger cast that will have already been integrated into the series. Viewers can then choose between <em>90210: The College Years</em> and <em>90210: The High School Years.</em></p>\n<p>Spelling also owns the merchandising rights to the show&#8212;Fox claims it owns none&#8212;and heâs been busy this past year lining up one product after another: clothes, school supplies, posters, boxer shorts, books, jewelry, trading cards, even a group of Barbie-like dolls based on the <em>90210</em> characters. Manufacturers such as Mattel, Procter &amp; Gamble, and SmithKline Beecham have become involved with the show. Even the Coca-Cola Company has been in discussions about tie-ins. (This is all understandable, since last summerâs new episodes attracted a whopping 69 percent of the female teenage audience.) But if Spelling gets greedy concerning his merchandising arrangements, wonât he risk cutting into the showâs cool factor? ââThis is a terrible thing to say,â admits Spelling, ââbut the truth is it gets down to financial problems. The licensing fees on Fox arenât as big as on the other networks, and you either have to make the show cheaper or you do merchandising. By the way, I donât think young merchandising lasts that long. Weâre trying not to do anything vulgar.â</p>\n<p>Who would have thought that âthe little show that could,â as the seriesâ executive producer, Charles Rosin, refers to <em>90210,</em> would become such a sensation? Fox didnât yank the show initially when it debuted opposite <em>Cheers</em> with dismally low ratings, because the network had nothing with which to replace it. But once the show began to catch on with teens, Fox brilliantly promoted it. In fact, the success of <em>90210</em> converged with the success of the network itself. Fox is now the number-one-rated network among teen viewers, and rates as high as NBC and CBS among adults eighteen to thirty-four. These are the most advertiser-friendly of demographics, and from its inception Fox has unabashedly courted them. âThe goal of the network was to try to differentiate itself from NBC and CBS,â claims Fox Broadcasting Companyâs president and chief operating officer, Jamie Kellner. âThe majority of their viewers tend to be fifty-plus. ABC less so than NBC and CBS. Our hope was to provide a service that younger people would look at as their network, the first new network that was designed, in effect, for them. . . . Teenagers have become very important. We are trying to work those areas much harder than the other networks are right now. To do a program that is about teenagers, which really focuses on their lives, is something that the other networks probably couldnât or shouldnât do, given their program formula. But for us itâs money in the bank.â</p>\n<p>Though Kellner is accused of being the conservative voice in the corporate mix when it comes to pulling <em>90210</em> back from the riskier subjects it dramatizes&#8212;AIDS, racial tensions, drug abuse, and, of course, the episode on Spring Dance night in which Dylan and Brenda have sex, a plot twist that Kellner now says was a mistake&#8212;he does go on the record more strongly than anyone else involved in the show as being in favor of approaching social issues head-on. âWithout them, it would be a very unimportant show,ââ he admits. âI think that the kids in some cases look to it to begin a dialogue with their parents about things. If you look at the demographics of who is watching, itâs not just teens. Itâs teens going all the way up into the midto late forties. So that says to me that itâs teens probably with their parents. It probably becomes one of the few times during the week where they stimulate a discussion. We know that from the mail we get&#8212;this program is something that the family shares together. ... I remember being a teenager, and the last thing I thought that I wanted to do was necessarily talk to my parents too much, because they were just going to get in my way. If anything, the demographics tell us that this show is letting each side get into the other sideâs head.â</p>\n<p>Does Kellner think there is a danger that too much merchandising of the franchise will cut into its popularity and hurt its ratings, thereby hurting Fox itself? âI think that if the show isnât good, then I would say yeah, it does. If the showâs good, I donât think you have to worry about it. But I know what youâre saying. When young people watch things, they think itâs theirs. And all of a sudden, you know, like âthe Manâ is starting to put Lukeâs picture on things, so itâs not cool anymore.â<br>\nThereâs no need to worry. Luke Perryâs coolness is not fashionable; it is innate. Like his beloved pigs, the guy was bom with the intelligent eyes of a movie star, though the carnal knowledge embedded there seems quite a bit older than the quarter of a century he admits to having lived. His famously furrowed brow has taught millions of teenage girls to read between the lines in ways they never thought possible. (The scar that divides his right eyebrow, which he actually got in a freak bowling-alley accident as a boy, simply adds to his physical mystique.) Smaller than expected, Perryâs body is scrawny, a quick scrawl of flesh. Heâs fashioned a kind of awkward tilt of his pompadoured hairdo while delivering his lines on- and offscreen that conveys an enchanting aw-shucks-I-just-want-to-make-love-to-you nonchalance. Indeed, Perry gives better head cock than old pro Reagan.</p>\n<p>Many show-business experts donât take him seriously, however, and constantly compare him to the teen idols of the past with their pseudosexual poses. But since he possesses the quiet irony of a bantam-weightier gang&#8212;Bogart, Cagney, even that other Ohio boy Paul Newman&#8212;he could easily surprise his detractors.<br>\nPerry longs to portray the late rodeo rider Lane Frost in a dramatic motion picture, so why would he choose a campily hip movie like <em>Buffy</em> for his first film since heâs become so popular? âI donât take myself that seriously. I donât always have to be <em>this guy.</em> I thought that was a real good way for me to show that. Iâm in no big hurry to have my name above the title of a motion picture just because Iâm commercial or marketable.â Fox, on the other hand, was prepared to scrap the picture unless Rosenman signed him for the motorcycle-riding rebel in the film. Perry describes his supporting role by saying, âIâm the damsel in distress,â and he smiles at the thought.</p>\n<p>Has such sudden, massive fame been a kind of crisis for him? âIâve enjoyed the shit out of it. There have been problems, but who am I to bitch about that? The long and short of it is that right now people think Iâm a patsy. They think Iâve lucked into this, that I donât know whatâs going on and they can take advantage of me&#8212;in business and otherwise.... Iâm not in this for my ego, and not out to become the biggest, baddest dude on the block. But I will get whatâs coming to me, and I will be treated with respect. Itâs just that simple. But I find a lot of people donât want that. They either want me to be real subservient or they expect me to be cocky. I donât think Iâm either of the two.â</p>\n<p>No, heâs a seducer. Coy, after all, is his real first name&#8212;Coy Luther Perry III. So, Coy, what is the gestalt of being the lone focus of millions of teenage sexual fantasies? Perryâs grin turns downright evil in the afternoon sun. His voice takes on a shadowy edge. âYou think itâs sexual?â he asks. âTo quote Anthony Hopkins in <em>The Silence of the Lambs.</em> ..â He pauses, then, pinching off his words, summons the voice of Hannibal Lecter: ââDo you think they picture sexual scenarios?â â<br>\nYeah, they do. Yet adults keep coming back to the same question: Why Luke Perry?</p>\n<p>âHeâs a wonderful <em>listener,</em> a lot of fun, much brighter than I expected, and needless to say also very attractive,â Maria Shriver tells me. She interviewed the young actor for her NBC show and is an expert on the trials and tribulations of celebrity. âHeâs amazingly humble, and heâs handling success much better than most people Iâve met&#8212;especially that kind of success.â</p>\n<p>âHe has a sweet sexuality,â says Rosenman. âI havenât seen anything like Luke since Tom Cruise. Luke and Tom have the same effect: they are deferential, they are polite, they are well mannered. They are <em>pros.</em> They are very similar in certain ways.â</p>\n<p>âA good part of <em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em> is that itâs got someone for everybody. It could be heâs someone for certain <em>noisier</em> people,â says Diller. âCome on, heâs the hooker with a heart of gold. Itâs always been the most appealing character. Now, you may translate it into a man or whatever, but itâs a guy whoâs living life somewhat darkly whoâs <em>sweet as hell.â</em></p>","rubric":"From the Archives","socialTitle":"Wild About Perry","socialDescription":"As the bad-boy heartthrob of Beverly Hills, 90210, Luke Perry, with Jason Priestley, helped catapult the Fox network into the highest teen ratings.

Usually when these kinds of images are released, <em>Game of Thrones</em> obsessives pore over every pixel in an attempt to wring some meaning out of them. Sometimes those searches are fruitful; other times they <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/game-of-thrones-sansa-pregnant\">birth terrible fan theories</a>. But HBO is particularly disinclined to provide fodder for either, which may be why these first images are essentially character portraits. They contain a few new costume details, but little else to give us the slightest clue&#8212;with one exception. Speaking of bad, old fan theories: does Cersei look at least a little pregnant here?

But viewers who only started keeping up with the Frasers when <em>Outlander</em> the TV series launched in 2014 were decidedly mixed on Season 4, as the show traveled further from its original premise&#8212;Jamie and Claireâs Scottish romance&#8212;to both the New World and a broader cast of characters. Series star <strong>Caitriona Balfe</strong> spoke with <em>Vanity Fair</em> about the challenges of depicting a faithful period drama that doesnât alienate the showâs modern and progressive audience, and where Season 5 will take the Frasers next.</p>\n<p>In its first two seasons, the plot of <em>Outlander</em> kept its characters primarily in Europe, where the war efforts of the British, the Scottish, and the French provided the high-stakes historical backdrop for Jamie and Claire Fraserâs will they/wonât they time-traveling romance. Here, we watched primarily white characters with a variety of plummy accents duke it out for love, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The showâs sex-positive message, Scottish-driven rebellion, and spirited female lead guaranteed that a large portion of its audience would be thirsty for stories with progressive attitudes told through the lens of history.</p>\n<p>But that dynamic hit a wall in Season 3, when Claire and Jamie followed their young nephew, Ian, to the New World. There, the Frasers&#8212;such spirited defenders of Scottish freedom&#8212;had to confront the realities of both African slavery and Native American dislocation. How do you keep your European leads sympathetic when their very existence depends on the exploitation of the nonwhite population? âJamie and Claire coming have empathy for the Native Americans,â Balfe admitted, âand yet they still become landowners on land taken from people who were originally there.â</p>\n<p><strong>Diana Gabaldonâs</strong> books, many written more than 20 years ago, arenât spotless when it comes to grappling with these challenges&#8212;and <em>Outlander</em>âs writers and producers have very <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/outlander-season-4-photos-video-exclusive-claire-jamie-america\">consciously</a> made some <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/outlander-season-4-episode-4-common-ground-bear-fight-cherokee-depiction-will-strongheart\">tweaks</a> to the narrative in order to balance Claire and Jamieâs American adventures with a more nuanced portrayal of the nonwhite cultures they encounter there. Both Jamie and Claireâs discomfort with the slaves working kindly on Aunt Jocastaâs plantation, River Run, and their interactions with various Native tribes have been somewhat re-written to cast the Frasers as even better allies than they were in the novel. But as Balfe put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the biggest hurdles we have in our show is that the story is\nprimarily told through Claire and Jamieâs eyes. Telling things âthe\nway they wereâ from the perspective of people who wrote down\nhistory&#8212;usually oppressors&#8212;youâre going to get a limited perspective.\nWeâre telling the story of the white immigrants in America through\ntheir eyes. Thatâs been a difficulty that weâve had.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though Gabaldon has come <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/2134205-how-do-you-feel-about-the-racial-sensitivity-in-the-portrayal-of-mr-wil\">under fire</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tyresecoleman/how-outlander-the-show-steered-clear-of-the-books\">past</a> for the depiction of nonwhite characters in her novels, Balfe pointed out that some of the chapters in the source material are âtold much more through the perspective of one of the slaves on the plantations.â She wondered if that point of view could perhaps have been given more weight in the Starz series as well, if the season had had more episodes. âBut itâs not what our show is,â she said.</p>\n<p>Sundayâs finale, much of which features Jamie, Claire, and Ian at odds with a combative group of Mohawks, comes only one week after a viral video of Covington Catholic High School <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nick-sandmann-today-show-nathan-phillips\">students staring down</a> Omaha tribe elder <strong>Nathan Phillips</strong> pushed the national conversation towards readdressing the way Native Americans have always been mistreated in this country. Itâs sensitive timing, to say the least. âWhether or not weâve been making missteps sometimes,âÂ Balfe said, âwhat I hope we do is spark a conversation, shine a light on that time. What the genesis is for what America is dealing with today. There were people here for millennia before Europeans came and settled, and this is a reminder of the roots of how American democracy came to be.â</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Balfe has been playing Claire Fraser for long enough now that itâs only natural she would feel some sense of ownership over the character. âOf course!â she laughingly replied when I asked if she ever pushed back on the way her character was written this season. <em>Outlander</em> saw a <a href=\"http://www.outlandertvnews.com/2017/11/new-writers-added-to-outlander-season-four-writers-room/\">large influx of new writers</a> in Seasons 3 and 4. âWhatâs great is that they bring a new perspective,â Balfe said. âBut for sure there are times that the character youâve been building is maybe not what theyâve written. Sometimes you have resistance to something because it doesnât feel honest. Sometimes you have resistance to something just because itâs new. Sometimes youâre like, âoh, I wish we hadnât done that.ââ</p>\n<p>But when asked about her favorite parts of the season, Balfe pounced on the meaty mother-daughter moments she was able to share with <strong>Sophie Skeltonâs</strong> Brianna. Briannaâs sexual assault in Season 4 is another story line that <em>Outlander</em>âs writers and producers decided to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/outlander-brianna-rape-season-4-episode-8-how-does-it-happen-in-the-books-sophie-skelton-interview\">alter slightly</a>, in a nod to the sensitivity of the current discussions around the #MeToo and Timeâs Up movements. But in the aftermath of her ordeal, <em>Outlander</em> doesnât shy away from Claire and Brianna discussing both the trauma of the event and the options of the resulting pregnancy. In this aspect, the source material needed no updates, Balfe said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are plot points from the story that we have to follow from the\nbook and Dianaâs books follow the aftermath. What does [sexual\nassault] do not just to the victim but to the victim&#39;s family? At that\ntime, it would only have been shame on the woman. Those are\nmentalities that persist today. If a man or a woman is assaulted, the\nvictim is shamed and itâs their fault. But it was nice to see modern\nwomen talking about choices regarding ownership around your own body\nand your own fertility. Unfortunately, these conversations have become\nso politicized that people are afraid to have them. It wasnât that we\nstuck them in because of personal opinions; itâs in the books. Diana\nwas bringing up these ideas 20 years ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Briannaâs entire Season 4 plot is part of a larger widening of the story beyond the magnetic pull between Claire and Jamie. âWeâve opened up the show this season to include Brianna and Roger and Marsali and Fergus and Murtagh and Jocasta,â Balfe pointed out. This move, though faithful to the books, has split the fandom. Fergus, Marsali, Murtagh, Ian, Lord John Grey, and Rollo all remain quite popular&#8212;but Briannaâs arc has been more <a href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/outlanders-brianna-problem-persists-in-an-episode-that-1831722851\">hit-and-miss</a>. And <strong>Richard Rankinâs</strong> Roger&#8212;who had a winning introduction to the show in Series 3&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.gofugyourself.com/outlander-the-ballad-of-how-much-roger-sucks-now-11-2018\">alienated</a> progressive, sex-positive <em>Outlander</em> fans in Season 4, thanks to the characterâs regressive attitudes towards sex, Brianna, and gender roles.</p>\n<p>But, as ever, <em>Outlander</em> got its core couple, Claire and Jamie, right in Season 4. Balfe said that her favorite part of the season&#8212;a sweet and sexy bath scene in Episode 6&#8212;centered on the original duo: âThat bath scene was so romantic and beautiful. It felt important that we still put emphasis on these intimate moments between Jamie and Claire.â</p>\n<p>Here, <em>Outlander</em> makes up for some of Rogerâs boorish attitudes by depicting the Frasers&#8212;now considerably older than the thirtysomething actors who portray them&#8212;as being as sexually dynamic as ever. âI think people have misinterpreted sometimes when weâve said, âweâre not doing the same thing as Season 1, this is a mature relationship,âÂ that we mean the intimacy or the passion is gone,âÂ Balfe said. âThatâs not true at all, but it changes. No oneâs relationship is a constant. Everyone goes through peaks and valleys as you get older, as you know each other more.â</p>\n<p>As of the finale, the Frasers not only have a significant amount of silver in their hair: they are also brand-new grandparents. But donât expect that to change anything. Balfe observed that massively devoted <em>Outlander</em> fans are often&#8212;though not exclusively&#8212;an older demographic: âIâve gotten so many letters and gotten to meet so many women who love to see the passion and love they have in their own marriages and in their own relationships reflected in our show. I think people have been starved to see that reflected back at them, because I donât think society values that as much. Once we turn 50, 60, 70, it doesnât mean that intimate aspects of your life disappear.â</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>So, what will Season 5 hold beyond more romance for Claire and Jamie? Well, despite Sony TVâs co-president <strong>Chris Parnell</strong> telling <em><a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/27/outlander-season-5-renewal-talks/\">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> back in 2017 that the series hopes to avoid another âDroughtlanderâ&#8212;the cute fan nickname for the long gap between seasons&#8212;Balfe said that the showâs renewal didnât quite come in time: âThe pickup came later than we would have needed to have a tighter gap between seasons.â Early rumors suggest that fans may not get any new episodes until 2020. When the pickup for more <em>Outlander</em> did come, however, it was for both Seasons 5 and 6&#8212;and that security, Balfe said, has allowed the writersâ room to let the story âbreathe.â Balfe hasnât seen any Season 5 scripts yet herself.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/caitrionambalfe/status/1089697869521666048\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/caitrionambalfe/status/1089697869521666048\">https://twitter.com/caitrionambalfe/status/1089697869521666048</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The finaleâs cliffhanger sees Jamie receive official orders that put him in direct conflict with Murtagh and the Regulators. This, Balfe reasonably observed, will be the big story line of Season 5. She predicted an âimminent battle between the Regulators and Jamie&#8212;who is a subject of Governor Tryon. We know the Revolutionary War is on the horizon. That will be the main focus, I suppose, a gearing up of various people on various sides and what that means.âÂ Season 4 lays some tidy ground there with sympathetic characters like Lord John Grey and Aunt Jocasta, who are already very much on the wrong side of history. Jamie and Claire, no doubt, will be caught in the middle.</p>\n<p>Balfe said that the fifth season will also focus on the growing community at Fraserâs Ridge, where Marsali, Fergus, Brianna, and Roger will all join Claire and Jamie as they continue to grow their families. Production designer <strong>Jon Gary Steele</strong> recently gave fans a little tease of whatâs to come there when he said that the Frasersâ new home, a.k.a. the Big House, was under construction.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/jongarysteele/status/1087471857853444097\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jongarysteele/status/1087471857853444097\">https://twitter.com/jongarysteele/status/1087471857853444097</a></p></blockquote></div><p>âObviously weâre going to base it on <em>The Fiery Cross,</em>â Balfe said, naming the next installment in Gabaldonâs book series, âbut Iâm not sure which parts of it the writers are going to keep.â Gabaldonâs fifth book is one of her longest. When it debuted in 2001, <em><a href=\"https://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-the-fiery-cross-vol-56-no-26/\">People</a></em> magazine called <em>The Fiery Cross</em> âa 350-page story that spills across 979 pages.â So itâs probable the <em>Outlander</em> writing staff will no longer feel it has to include every twist of the tale for fear of deviating from the source material, and angering very vocal book fans. At this point, thereâs simply not room for all of Gabaldonâs work in a season of television.</p>\n<p>But Balfe is excited for the potential in the showâs future. âAs shows go on longer and longer, it becomes more difficult to keep things new and exciting,âÂ she said, âbut the <em>Outlander</em> team is making sure nobody is resting on their laurels. Weâre thinking about things we want to explore further down the line thatâs not just plot.âÂ Does that mean more experimentation? We can only hope.

And they werenât wrong! Writing for <em>The New Yorker</em> last year, <strong>Dan Kaufman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/did-scott-walker-and-donald-trump-deal-away-the-governors-race-to-foxconn\">laid out</a> the many ways Trumpâs â<a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/10/24/watch_live_president_trump_holds_maga_rally_in_mosinee_wisconsin.html\">incredible</a>â deal was poised to screw Wisconsin locals for years to come, from the billions in âdirect cash payments from taxpayersâ that they wouldnât recoup for about a minimum of 2.5 decades, to forcing homeowners to sell their properties âat a price determined by the village,â to granting the company special court privileges (like the ability to make numerous appeals of unfavorable rulings in a single case), to serious concerns about the factoryâs impact on the water supply, to the fact that all those billions could be better used on things like the stateâs crumbling roads or understaffed rural schools. In theory, these minor downsides would have been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890361489126805504\">offset</a> by the âpotential for up to 13K new jobs in Wisconsin!â Unfortunately, Wednesdayâs news introduced a slight glitch <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/30/foxconns-plan-giant-wisconsin-factory-now-looks-uncertain/\">into that plan</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Foxconn, a prominent supplier for Apple and other electronics makers, says itâs scrapping plans to build a giant new factory in Wisconsin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âIn Wisconsin weâre not building a factory,â <strong>Louis Woo,</strong> special assistant to Foxconn chief executive <strong>Terry Gou,</strong> told Reuters. âYou canât use a factory to view our Wisconsin investment.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Per Representative <strong>Mark Pocan,</strong> this turn of events comes as Wisconsin has already poured massive amounts of cash into campus construction, new roads, and paying families who lived on what was supposed to be the factory site to relocate. And <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/foxconn-may-not-build-10b-wisconsin-plant-trump-touted-n964411\">thatâs not all</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Woo . . . said about three-quarters of Foxconnâs eventual jobs will be in R&amp;D and design&#8212;what he described as âknowledgeâ positions&#8212;rather than blue-collar manufacturing jobs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thousands of blue-collar jobs were, of course, one of the most important selling points of the original deal, and undoubtedly a major factor in Wisconsinâs decision to agree to put up billions in taxpayer funds. And speaking of jobs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this month, Foxconn . . . reiterated its intention to create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin, but said it had slowed its pace of hiring. The company initially said it expected to employ about 5,200 people by the end of 2020; a company source said that figure now looks likely to be closer to 1,000 workers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-foxconn-wisconsin-exclusive/exclusive-foxconn-reconsidering-plans-to-make-lcd-panels-at-wisconsin-plant-idUKKCN1PO0DU\">interview with Reuters</a>, Woo said the decision to scrap the factory&#8212;and plan to manufacture TV screens in Wisconsin&#8212;came about after Foxconn suddenly realized that âlabor expensesâ in the U.S. are comparatively much more expensive, a fact that was obvious from day one. âThis big change seems so weird&#8212;itâs puzzling,â <strong>Tim Bartik,</strong> a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, told <em>The Washington Post,</em> putting it mildly. âYouâre investing over a long-term period. Relative wages will change, and the technology will change, but all of that is taken into account in making the initial investment decision.â</p>\n<p>Trump&#8212;who previously dubbed the deal âthe most incredible thing Iâve ever seenâ&#8212;has not yet weighed in on the about-face, though given his penchant for promising Americans the world and then handing them a bill, he presumably doesnât see the problem.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>In the future, Apple will listen to 14-year-olds</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/facetime-glitch-apple.html\">Great work, everyone</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On January 19, <strong>Grant Thompson,</strong> a 14-year-old in Arizona, made an unexpected discovery: Using FaceTime, Appleâs video-chatting software, he could eavesdrop on his friendâs phone before his friend had even answered the call.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>His mother, <strong>Michele Thompson,</strong> sent a video of the hack to Apple the next day, warning the company of a âmajor security flawâ that exposed millions of iPhone users to eavesdropping. When she didnât hear from Apple Support, she exhausted every other avenue she could, including e-mailing and faxing Appleâs security team, and posting to Twitter and Facebook. On Friday, Appleâs product-security team encouraged Ms. Thompson, a lawyer, to set up a developer account to send a formal bug report.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But it wasnât until Monday, more than a week after Ms. Thompson first notified Apple of the problem, that Apple raced to disable Group FaceTime and said it was working on a fix. The company reacted after a separate developer reported the FaceTime flaw and it was written about on 9to5mac.com, a news site for Apple fans, in an article that went viral.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the company has already <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/30/apple-sued-for-facetime-bug-that-let-people-eavesdrop.html\">been hit</a> with what could be the first of many lawsuits over the bug. On Wednesday, Houston attorney <strong>Larry Williams II</strong> alleged that Apple âfailed to exercise reasonable careâ and that the tech giant âknew, or should have known, that its product would cause unsolicited privacy breaches and eavesdropping.â He claimed that he was âundergoing a private deposition with a client when this defective product breach allowedâ eavesdropping by a third party, causing âsustained permanent and continuous injuries, pain and suffering, and emotional trauma that will continue into the future.â (Apple did not respond to a request for comment re: Williamsâs suit.)</p>\n<p><strong>Area billionaire actually willing to pay more in taxes</strong></p>\n<p>All this week and last, people who fall into the âmetric fuck-ton of moneyâ tax bracket have spoken out against proposals by Senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> and Representative <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/davos-billionaires-aoc-tax-proposal\">as</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/democrats-want-to-know-what-russia-has-on-steve-mnuchin\">though</a> the lawmakers had suggested injecting anyone with assets above $10 million with the bubonic plague. On Wednesday, though, JPMorgan C.E.O. <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> bucked the trend, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/30/dimon-says-hes-willing-to-pay-higher-taxes-but-government-spending-needs-to-be-more-effective.html\">telling</a> CNBC, âI believe that individuals earning the most can afford to pay more, and I have no problem paying higher taxes to address some of the fundamental challenges and inequities in our society.â But donât think heâs coughing up the cash just so the government can piss it away on unnecessary crap. âHowever,â he added, âWe need to ensure that our tax dollars are going where they can be most effective&#8212;like expanding the earned-income tax credit and other programs that support the people and communities who really need it.â</p>\n<p><strong>Nikki Haley is doing pretty well for herself</strong></p>\n<p>The former U.N. ambassador is apparently <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/01/30/ex-un-ambassador-nikki-haley-charging-200000-per-speaking-gig.html\">cleaning up on the speaking circuit</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations <strong>Nikki Haley</strong> is currently quoting $200,000 and the use of a private jet for domestic speaking engagements, according to seven people with knowledge of the arrangement, who spoke on condition of anonymity because such quotes arenât made publicly available. Engagements outside the United States could cost considerably more, these people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, none of this should come as a shock: when she resigned last October, Haley said she would be taking a âstep upâ into the private sector after leaving the U.N., which paid considerably less well, as did her previous government gigs. (Haleyâs spokesperson did not respond to CNBCâs request for comment.)</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Hedge Funds Are Behaving Like We Just Had a Financial Crisis (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-30/hedge-funds-are-behaving-like-we-just-had-a-financial-crisis\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Venezuela Has 20 Tons of Gold Ready to Ship.

While there is of course a lid for every pot, many people likely found it extremely confusing when @WomenForCohen popped up on Twitter in May 2016, claiming that Cohen was hilarious, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WomenForCohen/status/727548629938925569\">an advocate for women</a>, â<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WomenForCohen/status/727669213809225728\">great looking and always dressed to impress</a>!â a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WomenForCohen/status/728396062998855680\">business genius</a>, a â<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WomenForCohen/status/729741480185741319\">guy who stands for honesty, integrity, and greatness</a>,â â<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WomenForCohen/status/729009951964729344\">charming, intelligent, &amp; handsome</a>,â and â<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WomenForCohen/status/738546275558264832\">loved around the world</a>.â So it made sense to learn on Thursday that the account was, in fact, conceived of by Cohen himself, who paid an I.T. firm thousands of dollars to, among other things, convince people that ladies are dying to f--k him. Per <em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/poll-rigging-for-trump-and-creating-womenforcohen-one-it-firms-work-order-11547722801\">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During the presidential race, Mr. Cohen also asked [RedFinch Solutions LLC founder] <strong>John Gauger</strong> to create a Twitter account called @WomenForCohen. The account, created in May 2016 and run by a female friend of Mr. Gauger, described Mr. Cohen as a âsex symbol,â praised his looks and character, and promoted his appearances and statements boosting Mr. Trumpâs candidacy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gauger was also apparently paid for things like rigging polls in <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> favor, though, sadly, it appears those efforts only went so far:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In January 2014, Mr. Cohen asked Mr. Gauger to help Mr. Trump score well in a CNBC online poll to identify the countryâs top business leaders by writing a computer script to repeatedly vote for him. Mr. Gauger was unable to get Mr. Trump into the top 100 candidates. In February 2015, as Mr. Trump prepared to enter the presidential race, Mr. Cohen asked him to do the same for a Drudge Report poll of potential Republican candidates, Mr. Gauger said. Mr. Trump ranked fifth, with about 24,000 votes, or 5 percent of the total.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the <em>Journal,</em> Cohen agreed to pay Gauger $50,000 for these tasks, but after inviting him to Trump Tower and handing him âa Walmart bag containing between $12,000 and $13,000 in cash and, randomly, a boxing glove that Mr. Cohen said had been worn by a Brazilian mixed-martial-arts fighter,â Cohen apparently stiffed the guy on the balance. (In his only statement to the <em>Journal</em> on the matter, the porno-fixer disputed that he paid in cash. âAll monies paid to Mr. Gauger were by check,â Cohen said.)</p>\n<p>Luckily for Cohen, he <em>was</em> paid in full, asking for and receiving a $50,000 reimbursement from Trump, which was âpaid largely out of Mr. Trumpâs personal account,â and set up a nice system for Cohenâs future reimbursement for buying the silence of porn star <strong>Stormy Daniels</strong> out of his own pocket. (Prosecutors said in <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/usavcohen082118.pdf?mod=article_inline&amp;mod=article_inline\">charging documents</a> filed last August that Cohen described Gaugerâs work as âtech servicesâ on the handwritten note he submitted to the Trump Organization.)</p>\n<p>The Trump Organization declined the <em>Journal</em>âs request for comment, while Trumpâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">five-star lawyer</a>, <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> seemingly only took issue with Cohenâs request to be reimbursed for more money than he paid RedFinch (âIf one thing has been established, itâs that Michael Cohen is completely untrustworthy,â he said). Cohen himself copped to the scam on Thursday, blaming the whole thing on his old boss, though he did not say whether Trump agrees that heâs a pit bull sex symbol:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/1085900900835778560\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/1085900900835778560\">https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/1085900900835778560</a></p></blockquote></div><p>According to Gauger, he last spoke with Cohen in April 2018, after the feds raided his office, which Cohen reportedly believed âwas not a big deal.â</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Donald Trump scrounges up funds to keep <em>some</em> federal employees working</strong></p>\n<p>While hundreds of thousands of workers have either been furloughed or forced to work without pay during the shutdown, a small group of lawyers is still receiving paychecks for a highly specific assignment, per the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-us-presses-ahead-with-border-wall-in-court-despite-shutdown-2019-1\">Associated Press</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A federal attorney in South Texas said in court this week that during the ongoing partial government shutdown, he only has been allowed to work on cases related to President Donald Trumpâs proposed border wall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Texas Civil Rights Project on Thursday released a transcript of a Tuesday hearing in a case where the U.S. government has sued a local landowner for her property along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Levander,</strong> Moonvesâs lawyer, has said that his client âdenies having any nonconsensual sexual relationâ and ânever put or kept someone on the payroll for the purpose of sex.â</p>\n<p><strong>Treasury denies being remotely close to a trade deal with China</strong></p>\n<p>At present, Donald Trump is waging a self-defeating trade war with China and presiding over the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, neither of which are making investors very happy. On Thursday though, it appeared there might be light at the end of the tunnel on one of those fronts, when <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-weighs-lifting-china-tariffs-to-hasten-trade-deal-calm-markets-11547754006\">reported</a> that U.S. officials were debating scaling back tariffs on Chinese imports âas a way to calm markets and give Beijing an incentive to make deeper concessions in a trade battle that has rattled global economies.â Of course, offering to roll back the punitive measures without getting any concessions in return wouldnât be very <em>Art of the Deal</em>-y, but 1) no one actually expects China to give Trump the things heâs been demanding for the past 10 months, and 2) the president is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-is-gripped-by-market-volatilityand-his-role-in-it-1544199996\">obsessed</a> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/06/trump-stock-market-boasts-395193\">with the stock market</a> and, with his standing at home <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/685539207/poll-trump-approval-down-slips-with-base\">even worse than usual</a>, is presumably desperate for a market rally that he can tout on Twitter. Only, after the Dow spiked 200 points on the news, the Treasury claimed the report wasnât true in a statement that struck some as a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-17/mnuchin-is-said-to-push-for-lowering-china-tariffs-wsj-reports\">denial</a> that wasnât exactly as forceful as it could have been:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Treasury spokesman said bargaining positions âare all at the discussion stageâ and that âneither Secretary Mnuchin nor Ambassador Lighthizer have made any recommendations to anyone with respect to tariffs or other parts of the negotiation with China.â Talks are ânowhere near completion,â the spokesman said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, there appears to be total uncertainty about whatâs going to happen. On the one hand, the president previously tried to stoke the markets by claiming heâd struck an <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-admits-his-incredible-deal-with-china-is-bullshit\">âincredibleâ deal</a> with China, and given his desperation for a win, could conceivably decide to declare mission accomplished on the trade front in the hopes of garnering some good news.

women at the bank earn 71 percent of their male colleaguesâ pay.","body":"<p>In recent years, itâs become <em>de rigueur</em> for corporate America to prove itâs hip to the new way of doing things, i.e. that it <em>totally gets</em> itâs not O.K. to, say, sexually harass women, discriminate against them when hiring, and pay them like crap in comparison to their male counterparts, for the simple reason that they lack appendages that at one time you could wordlessly point to as explanation for why a male would be paid many multiples of a female. So when Citigroup <a href=\"https://blog.citigroup.com/2018/01/pay-equity-at-citi\">announced last year</a> that, after accounting for âjob function, level, and geography,â internal analysis showed women at the bank were paid, on average, 99 percent of what men made, the company must have been pretty pleased! Unfortunately, the unadjusted data makes Citigroup look <em>slightly</em> less woke. As the bank <a href=\"https://blog.citigroup.com/2019/01/global-pay-equity-at-citi\">revealed</a> in a new blog post on Wednesday:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Today, weâre also being transparent about another piece of information. Weâve calculated our unadjusted or ârawâ pay gap for women and U.S. minorities&#8212;which measures the difference in median total compensation when we donât adjust for factors such as job function, level, and geography. This analysis shows that the median pay for women globally is 71 percent of the median for men, and the median pay for U.S. minorities is 93 percent of the median for non-minorities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ooo, thatâs not a great look! Particularly given that one factor the bank says widened the gap was seniority, as claiming there would be less of a disparity if only women were promoted more is not a great argument. While Citi says it was the first U.S. bank to release a pay gap report last year, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-16/citigroup-reveals-its-female-employees-earn-29-less-than-men-do\">according to Bloomberg</a> it only put out todayâs much-less-flattering figures after significant pressure from activist shareholder Arjuna Capital, which filed a shareholder proposal in November asking the bank âto report the more straightforward comparison of menâs and womenâs median earningsâ of its entire workforce. âIf weâre only dealing with statistically adjusted numbers, then weâre only dealing with half the problem,â said Arjuna managing partner <strong>Natasha Lamb.</strong> âWe need more women in higher-paid positions and leadership.â</p>\n<p>To be fair, Citi insists itâs actually going to do something to bridge the gap, with a âgoal . . . to increase representation at the Assistant Vice President through Managing Director levels to at least 40 percent for women globallyâ by the end of 2021. (To account for discrepancy between minority and non-minority pay, it hopes to similarly increase representation for black employees in the U.S. by 8 percent.) Still, a goal is not the same thing as a mandate, so . . . check back in in 2021.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hoaxers force worldâs largest asset manager to deny authorship of letter advocating environmentally friendly policies</strong></p>\n<p>Every year, BlackRock founder <strong>Larry Fink</strong> sends a letter to C.E.O.s about issues facing investors. Last year, for instance, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/business/dealbook/blackrock-laurence-fink-letter.html\">told</a> public companies that they must contribute to society, or risk losing the support of a firm that manages <a href=\"https://www.pionline.com/article/20180716/ONLINE/180719909/blackrock-aum-slips-in-quarter-but-up-for-year\">more than $6 trillion in assets</a>. And this year, on Wednesday, a similarly high-minded missive went out saying BlackRock would ârequire all companies we hold stakes in to align their business models with the goals of the Paris Agreement,â in an effort to back up its criticism of the Trump administration for pulling out of the global accord that seeks to combat climate change, âan important framework for long-term sustainability.â Only, the letter wasnât actually from Fink, but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd2113e4-198e-11e9-b93e-f4351a53f1c3\">a group of enterprising scamps</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BlackRock has been targeted by an elaborate hoax involving a spoof letter purporting to be written by the fund groupâs chief executive Larry Fink that was sent to media outlets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The letter, which appears to be the work of environmental campaigners, issued a warning to companies that they must take decisive action on tackling climate change or be dumped by the worldâs largest investor . . . The hoax also included the creation of a detailed Web site that closely mimics that of BlackRock.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Taking the bit a step further, an extremely official-looking press release claiming to be from a company spokesman <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/16/blackrock-says-an-unidentified-party-sent-a-fake-letter-about-its-environmental-investments-to-several-thousand.html\">was also sent out</a>, disavowing the letter and saying the firm has no plans to âpressur[e] companies toward Paris-compliance and long-term sustainability,â as such things are âare at odds with near-term profitability.â While, sadly, the asset manager did not in fact issue that specific denial, it did tweet that the letter claiming it espouses such environmentally friendly policies was fake:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/blackrock/status/1085530005491326976\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/blackrock/status/1085530005491326976\">https://twitter.com/blackrock/status/1085530005491326976</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Wall Street did pretty well for itself last year</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-16/it-s-official-wall-street-just-made-100-billion-for-first-time?srnd=premium\">President Donny</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The six biggest U.S. banks have never had a $100 billion year. Until now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and their peers have already reported more than $111 billion of profit for 2018. Morgan Stanley will only make that number bigger when it releases its fourth-quarter results Thursday. They have Republican tax cuts to thank, along with rising interest rates, a surge in deal-making, and a retail-banking boom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Youâll never believe it, but Trumpâs former coal-lobbyist E.P.A. pick plans to gut environmental regulations</strong></p>\n<p>You <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/01/16/confirmation-hearing-trumps-epa-pick-vows-advance-deregulatory-agenda/?utm_term=.91a2e37f62a8\">might want to sit down for this</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> a former fossil-fuel industry lobbyist whom President Trump nominated earlier this month to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, told a key Senate panel Wednesday that he would continue the administrationâs aggressive reversal of environmental rules, even as Democrats asked him why he wasnât doing more to curb greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âThrough our deregulatory actions, the Trump administration has proven that burdensome federal regulations are not necessary to drive environmental progress,â Wheeler claimed with a straight face during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, not mentioning the <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/trumps-lasting-damage-to-the-environment/a-44315788\">significant damage his boss has already inflicted on the environment</a>. He added that âcertainty, and the innovation that thrives in a climate of certainty, are key to progress.â</p>\n<p><strong>Government just ignored this little document when it came to deciding Trump could keep his interest in D.C. hotel</strong></p>\n<p>That <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/16/politics/trump-hotel-gsa-inspector-general/index.html\">pesky Constitution</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The General Services Administration ignored constitutional implications when deciding to maintain the lease of the Old Post Office Building to the Trump International Hotel after Donald Trump became president, according to a new inspector-general report on the deal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âG.S.A.âs decision-making process related to Tenantâs possible breach of the lease included serious shortcomings. G.S.A. had an obligation to uphold and enforce the Constitution. However, G.S.A. opted not to seek any guidance from O.L.C., and did not address the constitutional issues related to the management of the lease,â the I.G. report says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ah, well.

Davos, $43 Hot Dogs and Existential Despair","dek":"The worldâs wealthiest investors are afraid.","promoDek":"The worldâs wealthiest investors are afraid.","body":"<p>Each year in January, the World Economic Forum holds its annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. For three days, the Ã¼ber-elites of business and politics gather to discuss the state of the world and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/davos-elites-simulate-the-refugee-experience-by-pretending-to-flee-advancing-armies\">try to understand how the other half lives</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2015/01/23/davos-home-of-the-43-hot-dog.html\">eating $43 hot dogs</a>, guzzling champagne, and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/davos-party-scene\">partying late into the night</a> with a collection of people whose net worth exceeds the G.D.P. of many small and some medium-sized countries. This year, though, things are slightly different. For starters, the attendees have gone from merely filthy, stinking rich to <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/dimon-schwarzman-and-other-davos-a-listers-add-175-billion-in-10-years.amp\">making the filthy, stinking rich look poor</a>. More important, the worldâs gazillionaires are completely and totally freaked out about whatâs to come.</p>\n<p>On Monday, before the festivities kicked off, the International Monetary Fund slashed its forecast for global growth, and fear that central banks lack the adequate ammunition to fight a slump dominated day one of the conference. âWhat worries me most is if we were to run into a serious problem, a recession or something worse, we would have very limited firepower left to respond to it,â <strong>Philipp Hildebrand,</strong> vice chairman of BlackRock, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-22/dalio-aligned-with-davos-view-that-fed-has-to-rethink-tightening\">told Bloomberg TV</a>. His worry was echoed by hedge-fund manager <strong>Ray Dalio,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/bridgewaters-dalio-the-next-economic-downturn-worries-me-the-most.html\">said</a> during a panel that âwhat scares me the most longer term is that we have limitations to monetary policy&#8212;which is our most valuable tool&#8212;at the same as we have greater political and social antagonism. So, the next downturn in the economy worries me the most.â</p>\n<p>Fear about global social tensions, combined with rising debt levels were the major themes of billionaire investor <strong>Seth Klarmanâs</strong> annual letter, which was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/business/dealbook/world-economic-forum-klarman.html\">circulated</a> among major policymakers and executives ahead of the conference. âIt canât be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions,â Klarman wrote, saying that âSocial cohesion is essential for those who have capital to invest.â Alarmingly, the hedge-fund manager noted that âthe seeds of the next major financial crisis (or the one after that) may well be found in todayâs sovereign debt levels,â with nearly every developed country in the world taking on massive amounts of debt since the 2008 crisis. Most worrisome to him is the debt load in the U.S. âThere is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford,â he warned. âBy the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order . . . It is not hard to imagine worsening social unrest among a generation that is falling behind economically and feels betrayed by a massive national debt that was incurred without any obvious benefit to them.â</p>\n<p>Citing geopolitical events like the U.S.-China trade war and the complete and total clusterfuck that is Brexit, <strong>Martin Gilbert,</strong> co-C.E.O. of Standard Life Aberdeen, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/standard-life-aberdeen-ceo-we-are-in-a-worst-place-today-than-last-year.html\">told</a> CNBC that we are âcertainly . . . in a worse place than we were a year ago,â predicting that the global economy could face even more trouble. âEven though the economists say global growth will be OK next year, the stock markets are telling us something completely different,â he said. âThey are usually a very good forward-looking indicator and they are saying there is a bit of trouble ahead.â</p>\n<p>Of course, the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-22/as-trump-s-guardrails-come-down-davos-elite-braces-for-tumult\">most terrifying thing on everyoneâs mind</a> was the orange elephant not in the room.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âThe number one question in the mind of leaders in Davos now is what on earth is Donald Trump up to?â said <strong>Tina Fordham,</strong> chief global political analyst at Citigroup Inc. and a WEF regular. âWeâve very clearly moved in terms of investor sentiment from the Trump bump euphoria surrounding tax cuts and deregulation to fears of a Trump slump.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âThere is no longer this idea that heâd be reined in by the establishment and that youâd have a fairly normal administration,â said <strong>Stephen Walt,</strong> a professor of international affairs at Harvard University. âPeople are now fully aware that heâs extremely impulsive and erratic and will continue to challenge the status quo. That means something different depending where you are.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Lessons from the âTrump and the Mediaâ <a

In Murdochâs media empire, which includes News Corp. and Twentieth Century Fox, everything revolves around him. Hundreds of newspaper properties around the world lead back to the Australian-born billionaire, who has been credited with âinventing the modern tabloidâ in the course of his ascendancy from local broadsheet owner to global news baron.\n<p>Murdoch started small, taking the Southern Australian <em>Adelaide News,</em> the family-owned daily he received upon his fatherâs death, and turning it into a regional success. Still in his early 20s, Murdoch expanded quickly, buying up other newspapers and boosting their numbers with his trademark focus on sex, sports, and scandal.</p>\n<p>Over the next several years, his empire grew to include media properties in New Zealand, Britain, and finally, the United States, where he bought the <em>San Antonio Express-News,</em> founded the supermarket tabloid <em>Star,</em> and eventually purchased the <em>New York Post</em> and publisher HarperCollins. In the 1980s, he extended his dominion to include television, too, buying a stake in Twentieth Century Fox and, in 1990, forming British Sky Broadcasting (now known as Sky, the U.K.âs largest pay-TV broadcaster).</p>\n<p>Murdoch, now in his 80s, has an aggressive editorial sensibility that has made him a bÃªte noire to some. On the left, he is often pilloried for his conservative ideology, which he has worked to popularize through right-leaning outlets like <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and Fox News. And his inclination to court controversy has sometimes crossed into the criminal realm: in 2011, Murdochâs <em>News of the World,</em> among other companies, was accused of bribery and phone hacking to get scoops, leading to him being investigated by both the British government and the F.B.I. In 2012, he resigned as director of News International and from several other companies connected to it. (Murdoch doesnât shy from more personal scandals either, divorcing his third wife, Wendi Deng, amid rumors she had an affair with Tony Blair, and recently marrying former model Jerry Hall, 25 years his junior.) In 2015, it was announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as the C.E.O. of 21st Century Fox, handing his two sons, James and Lachlan, the keys to the kingdom. Still, Murdoch by all reports is still firmly in charge of his empire, despite frequent questions about a plan of succession.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f478f0f807a3a48c7150a_hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","credit":"From REX/Shutterstock.","_links":{},"id":"574f478fb1a9903a488277a2","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/rupert-murdoch","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f478f0f807a3a48c7150a_hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","credit":"From REX/Shutterstock.","_links":{},"id":"574f478fb1a9903a488277a2","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"searchable":true,"expired":false,"revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/rupert-murdoch","distributionChannels":[{"name":"web-owned-and-operated","metadata":{"searchable":true}}],"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revision":0,"entityId":"574f479cbdf148e4205f29e5"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"âA.O.C.

But others say the tabloid is just manifesting its wizardry in the dark arts of the rag trade.","body":"<p>Perhaps more than any of her senior congressional colleagues, <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</strong> the 29-year-old freshman congresswoman from the Bronx, has dominated the left&#39;s post-primary, pre-2020 political landscape in a once-unfathomable, Obama-esque dervish. <em>New Yorker</em> editor in chief <strong>David Remnick</strong> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-coming-for-your-hamburgers\">interviewed</a> her several days ago. <em>Vogue</em> gave her an <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-interview-vogue-november-2018-issue\"><strong>Annie Leibovitz</strong> photo shoot</a> in the fall. (<em>Vanity Fair</em> has featured her on a cover as well.) The virality of her tweets rivals those of the president. When Ocasio-Cortez arrived in the hallway of Capitol Hill for <strong>Michael Cohenâs</strong> congressional testimony last week, she received a celebrityâs welcome from the spectators who were milling about. At one point when Cohen was speaking during the hearing, the TV cameras shifted off of him and onto Ocasio-Cortez, as she got up to whisper something to another House member. As <strong>Margaret Sullivan</strong> posited in a <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-ravenous-hysteria-over-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-just-reached-a-new-level-of-crazy/2019/03/04/107e176a-3e7b-11e9-922c-64d6b7840b82_story.html\">headline</a> on Monday, âThe âravenous hysteriaâ over Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez just reached a new level of crazy.â</p>\n<p>One of A.O.C.âs hometown news organizations, however, has gone to war with the budding representative for New Yorkâs 14th Congressional District. âWhere in the world does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez live?â the <em>New York Post</em> asked in an extensive February 23 <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/02/23/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-nowhere-to-be-seen-near-bronx-home/\">exposÃ©</a> that cast doubt on the congresswomanâs residence in the Parkchester neighborhood, where she is registered to vote, according to the <em>Post.</em> âShe may be Americaâs most famous freshman congresswoman, but in New York, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a virtual ghost,â claimed the article, which prompted a pair of sneering follow-ups (âOcasio-Cortez covers tracks in address debacleâ; âAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she moved out of Bronx home where no one ever saw herâ), and a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/02/25/aocs-self-inflicted-wound-followed-by-another-victim-act/\">takedown</a> from the <em>Post</em>âs red-blooded editorial board: âA.O.C.âs self-inflicted wound&#8212;followed by another victim act.â</p>\n<p>This week, the <em>Post</em>âs A.O.C. crusade continued with a blistering âEXCLUSIVE REPORTâ and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harrysiegel/status/1102229653241151488\">cover story</a> blasting the architect of the Green New Deal for her use of an automobile: âECO TRIP; Gas-guzzling car rides expose A.O.C.âs green hypocrisy.â This time, Ocasio-Cortez had had enough. âThe <em>Post</em> put the fact that I get into cars (while proposing a plan to invest in better car technology) on their front page,â she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1102235167723274240\">tweeted</a>. âPack it up folks, the Pulitzerâs been decided. No one can rival this kind of hard-hitting journalism.â (Representatives for the <em>Post</em> and Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>The <em>New York Post</em> takes glee in skewering progressives, especially when it comes to what the tabloid sees as their environmental sanctimony. The <em>Post</em> <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/06/02/de-blasio-claims-hes-a-champion-of-the-environment/\">went after</a> mayor <strong>Bill de Blasio</strong> for taking an S.U.V. to the gym, and it has <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/12/06/al-gore-has-done-more-harm-than-good-battling-climate-change/\">delighted</a> in taking shots at <strong>Al Goreâs</strong> use of a private jet. Similarly, the <strong>Anthony Weiner</strong> sexting scandals generated a prodigious collection of pun-laden tabloid covers, as did the blistering front-page circus that was <strong>Hillary Clintonâs</strong> presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>In this sense, Ocasio-Cortez is just the latest recipient of the <em>Post</em>âs unforgiving hijinks. But even insiders acknowledge that the A.O.C. drumbeat has seemed âfairly relentless,â as one source put it. âThe theory is that it is part of the new marching orders from the top.â</p>\n<p>The <em>Post,</em> as Iâve <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/col-allan-is-back-to-help-figure-out-the-posts-trump-coverage\">reported</a>, recently reorganized its leadership ranks, including putting a new editor in charge of digital content, replacing the team that had been running digital for the past several years. Additionally, Trump-loving former <em>Post</em> editor in chief <strong>Col Allan</strong> has returned to the tabloid in a consulting capacity.</p>\n<p>However, the real driving force behind the Ocasio-Cortez smorgasbord is probably a lot more obvious. âA.O.C. is the new Trump bump,â a second <em>Post</em> source told me, noting that coverage of her is consistently among the top-performing stories on nypost.com. In the past six days alone, the Web site has published 24 A.O.C. articles about everything from her ties to <strong>Bernie Sanders,</strong> to a former Greenpeace president <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/03/05/ocasio-cortez-is-a-pompous-little-twit-ex-greenpeace-president/\">calling her</a> a âpompous little twit,â to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1102584535257137152\">joke</a> she made, apparently <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/03/04/ocasio-cortez-jokes-about-using-pen-and-paper-in-light-of-post-expose/\">in reference</a> to the <em>Post,</em> about using paper: âI need to admit something to you all. Frankly, I donât know how my environmental reputation can recover.â</p>\n<p>âAt the end of the day, itâs tabloid nature,â the second <em>Post</em> source said. âItâs an easy shot at a liberal, but itâs also an easy shot at a new political darling.â And when Ocasio-Cortez punches back, the source continued, âit just adds more fuel to the fire, and you have to keep going.â A third <em>Post</em> veteran agreed with that assessment: âWhen someone reacts like that to <em>Post</em> coverage and they hit a nerve, the <em>Post</em> doubles down.

Is this the first step in a larger strategy to sell the newly spun-off company?","body":"<p><strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> alliance with Fox News has been one of the few constants throughout his shambolic presidency. But in recent days, that bond has shown signs of fraying. On Sunday morning, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1107269978678611969\">criticized</a> Fox after it suspended <strong>Judge Jeanine Pirro</strong> for delivering an offensive monologue questioning Democratic Congresswoman <strong>Ilhan Omarâs</strong> patriotism. Later in the day, Trump lashed out at Fox journalists, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1107345541724291072\">tweeting</a>: âWere @FoxNews weekend anchors, @ArthelNeville and @LelandVittert, trained by CNN prior to their ratings collapse? In any event, thatâs where they should be working, along with their lowest rated anchor, <strong>Shepard Smith</strong>!â He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1107276504415854592\">implored</a> Fox to âKeep fighting for Tuckerâ&#8212;Media Matters had <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2019/03/10/unearthed-audio-tucker-carlson-makes-numerous-misogynistic-and-perverted-comments/223092\">uncovered</a> a series of offensive statements <strong>Tucker Carlson</strong> had made while calling in to <strong>Bubba the Love Spongeâs</strong> radio show&#8212;âand fight hard for @JudgeJeanine.â</p>\n<p>Trumpâs attacks on Fox have widened the chasm between the networkâs opinion hosts and the news division, which have been fighting a cold civil war since Roger Ailes was ousted in July 2016. Fox journalists, bristling at being branded an arm of the Trump White House, are lobbying Fox News C.E.O. <strong>Suzanne Scott</strong> and President <strong>Jay Wallace</strong> to rein in <em>Fox &amp; Friends,</em> <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> <strong>Lou Dobbs</strong> and Pirro. âReporters are telling management that weâre being defined by the worst people on our air,â a frustrated senior Fox staffer told me. Foxâs opinion hosts, meanwhile, have made the case that Foxâs prime-time lineup not only reflects the audienceâs worldview, but is responsible for the majority of the networkâs advertising revenue. âWe make the money,â an anchor close to Hannity told me.</p>\n<p>The outcome of that civil war will be decided by Fox Corporation chairman and C.E.O. <strong>Lachlan Murdoch.</strong> <strong>Rupertâs</strong> oldest son took over the smaller media company that emerged out of the Murdochsâ $71 billion deal to sell their entertainment assets to Disney. Though Lachlan hired West Wing stalwart <strong>Hope Hicks,</strong> staffers believe he is likely to nudge the network away from its close marriage to Trump. Sources close to Lachlan pointed out that Lachlan is a libertarian conservative, not a MAGA diehard, who in private has expressed annoyance at Trump. âHe doesnât like Trump,â one person who has spoken with Lachlan told me. âThereâs a lot of talk of the direction of the network changing under Lachlan,â the senior Fox staffer told me.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/d7b621dd-7240-4e6f-883f-42f814ab19d6\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/d7b621dd-7240-4e6f-883f-42f814ab19d6\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

And donât forget to subscribe.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Sources pointed out the hiring of <strong>Donna Brazile</strong> and the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/paul-ryan-joins-fox-news-board\">appointment</a> of Trump critic <strong>Paul Ryan</strong> to Fox Corpâs board as signs of Lachlanâs view on Trump. âDonna is a shot in that direction. Management knows they have an image problem.â (A spokesman for Lachlan declined to comment.)  Indeed, at an advertiser sales event in recent days, brands complained to Fox News executives about the networkâs association with Trump, a source briefed on the meeting told me. (Through a spokesperson, Foxâs head of ad sales, <strong>Marianne Gambelli,</strong> said this was âcompletely false.â)</p>\n<p>Two sources close to Lachlan told me that he has likely waited to implement any editorial changes at Fox News until the Disney deal closes on March 20, for fear of antagonizing Trump into opposing it. (<em>The New Yorker</em>âs <strong>Jane Mayer</strong> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house\">recently reported</a> that Trump had told former economics adviser <strong>Gary Cohn</strong> to direct the Justice Department to block AT&amp;Tâs takeover of Time Warner. Cohn reportedly didnât act on Trumpâs directive.) And the senior Fox staffer cautioned that any changes will be modest, at least at first. âLachlan is not <strong>James,</strong>â the staffer said, referring to Rupertâs liberal younger son. (âFox  News will continue to provide a platform for a diverse range of voices in its opinion programming and fair and balanced news coverage as it always has,â a Fox executive told me.)</p>\n<p>Another vector influencing the Trump-Fox relationship is Hannityâs frustration with the Murdochs. Sources said Hannity is angry at the Murdochsâ firing of Ailes and <strong>Bill Shine,</strong> Hannityâs close friend and former producer. Hannity believes the Murdochs are out to get Trump. âHannity told Trump last year that the Murdochs hate Trump, and Hannity is the only one holding Fox together,â a source who heard the conversation told me. Hannity has told friends that he intends to leave Fox when his contract expires in early 2021, two people whoâve spoken with him said. (Hannity did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Ultimately, creating some distance from the president may be the first step in a larger strategy. Some believe itâs only a matter of time before the Murdochs sell Fox News. âEveryone thinks theyâre going to sell it. Itâs too small to be independent,â the anchor told me.</p>\n<p>âFox has been underestimated dating back to its inception as the fourth major network and continues to challenge conventional wisdom, exceeding expectations as a strategically bold, transformational media brand,â the Fox executive said. âThat wonât change.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What does âelite universityâ even mean?

As <em>Variety</em> <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/fox-corporation-debut-disney-murdoch-1203165925/\">reports</a>, Ryan will be joining the seven-person board of the newly formed Fox Corporation, which has been spun out as its own company following <strong>Rupert Murdochâs</strong> sale of 21st Century Foxâs entertainment assets to Disney. The slimmed-down Fox Corp., which includes Fox News, Fox Sports, and Fox Broadcasting, will be run by Murdochâs eldest son, <strong>Lachlan.</strong> It will also allow Murdoch, who is friendly with President <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> to keep an eye on his media empire. Both Murdochs will sit on the board of the new company, alongside Ryan, <strong>Anne Dias, Chase Carey, Roland A. Hernandez,</strong> and <strong>Jacques Nasser.</strong></p>\n<p>Itâs something of a return to the world of conservative politics for Ryan, whose abrupt decision to retire from Congress signaled a sea change in the Republican Party. One of a wave of G.O.P. members who declined to run for re-election in 2018, Ryan was ruthlessly criticized on both the left and the right for his prevaricating and occasionally gutless support of Trumpâs political agenda. (Ryan himself insisted heâd actually done a service to the country by restraining Trump at his worst moments. âI can look myself in the mirror at the end of the day and say I avoided <em>that</em> tragedy, I avoided <em>that</em> tragedy, I avoided <em>that</em> tragedy,â Ryan told <strong>Mark Leibovich</strong> in a lengthy <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/magazine/paul-ryan-speakership-end-trump.html\">interview</a> last year, though he declined to specify the various catastrophes he had averted.) At the same time, he remained a resolute champion of donor-class priorities, such as the massive corporate tax cut he shepherded through Congress before stepping down. Under the new law, Murdochâs company likely saved <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/business/media-and-marketing/tv/rupert-murdochs-2-billion-trump-christmas-present-tax-break-on-foxdisney-deal-20180202-h0sqba\">several billion dollars</a> on its tax bill for spinning off Fox Corp.</p>\n<p>After Ryan retired, the speculation had been that he might return to Washington to oversee a right-leaning think tank, such as the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/398477-paul-ryan-would-be-perfect-fit-to-lead-aei-republicans-say\">leader-less, pro-free-market American Enterprise Institute</a>. Instead, it appears heâs courting a different kind of power&#8212;and, potentially, a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1308161/000119312516717705/d128342ddef14a.htm#toc128342_14\">bigger paycheck</a>&#8212;overseeing the corporate side of Donald Trumpâs safe space.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What does âelite universityâ even mean?

Cueâs hard sell (âWeâll make you the most-read newspaper in the world.â) But Rupert Murdoch has always loved Apple, and he brought the <em>Journal</em> in.","body":"<p>On the evening of Wednesday, March 27, a few dozen magazine and digital-media notables gathered in a capacious loft in a Civil War-era five-story former mansion in Lower Manhattan. It was a very Silicon Valley version of New York. As someone who has been to the loft described it to a local news Web site, it âbasically looks like what youâd expect would happen if Apple decorated a Tribeca apt, complete with glass staircase.â Indeed, the trillion-dollar tech behemoth sometimes hosts events in the space, and thatâs why the publishing crowd was assembled there. Two days earlier, Apple had lifted the veil on its much-ballyhooed media strategy, in a star-studded dog and pony show held at the companyâs 2.8 million-square-foot Cupertino campus. In addition to a <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>-approved original programming slate that will compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon, Apple also introduced <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/apple-launches-apple-news-plus-an-immersive-magazine-and-news-reading-experience/\">Apple News+</a>, a $9.99-a-month reading bundle that gives iOS users access to a pair of major American newspapers (<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>); a smattering of premium digital brands (including theSkimm, Vox, TechCrunch, Vulture, and The Cut); and magazines (from <em>People</em> and <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> to <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>Vanity Fair</em>) that were previously packaged through the Netflix-style subscription service Texture, which Apple bought for an undisclosed sum last year. (Texture had previously been owned by a small consortium of publishers, including CondÃ© Nast, which owns <em>Vanity Fair</em>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Eddy Cue</strong> and other Apple executives worked the room, among editors and business-side people from participating publications like <em>New York, GQ, Time, Esquire, The Atlantic,</em> and others&#8212;a casual cocktail reception to welcome Appleâs new publishing partners. But as the guests munched on mini empanadas and potato bites, some of them couldnât help but wonder if there was a Trojan horse in their midst. As one attendee later joked, âAre we at a party, or a wake?â</p>\n<p>That more or less sums up the schizophrenic reactions to the launch of Apple News+, which is the latest&#8212;and arguably the most consequential&#8212;entrant in a series of newfangled platform-publisher experiments ranging from Facebook Instant Articles, to Snapchat Discover, to Google Amp. On the one hand, publications throughout the industry have either moved, or are moving, toward revenue models in which people pay them directly for what theyâre reading online. Apple&#39;s new venture can give publications like these the opportunity to reach millions of Apple consumers who might not already be subscribing to their content, as long as these publications are willing to give Apple a reported 50 percent of the total News+ subscription pie. (The other half is being split amongst the publishers based on engagement levels.) This proposition may sound especially promising to publications that donât already have large, loyal audiences paying to read them on the Web each month. As one media executive put it to me, âIf you have a subscription business or a membership business, and youâve got, like, 9,000 digital subscribers, you donât have much to lose going in with Apple.â</p>\n<p>On the other hand, by getting on board with Apple News+, you run the risk of abdicating your direct relationship with readers and potentially cannibalizing your existing subscriber pool, thereby handing more leverage to an ever-more-powerful platform economy that has already wreaked havoc on journalism and the news business. âI have a suggestion: everyone who subscribes directly to any and all publications participating on News+ should unsubscribe ASAP and subscribe to the Apple bundle,â <strong>Rafat Ali</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rafat/status/1110685920653651969\">sniped</a> on Twitter. âOnly then will publishers realize their own idiocies here.â In a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/no-need-to-subscribe/\">searing takedown</a> of Apple News+ published by one of its own partner publications, TechCrunch, <strong>Josh Constine</strong> argued that âpublishers are crazy to jump into bed with Apple News+. . . . Publishers hope theyâll get exposure to new audiences. But any potential new or existing direct subscriber to a publisher will no longer be willing to pay a healthy monthly fee to occasionally access that top content while supporting the rest of the newsroom. Theyâll just cherry pick what they want via News+, and Apple will shave off a few cents for the publisher while owning all the data, customer relationship and power.â</p>\n<p>That would appear to be the primary concern of the two major News+ holdouts: <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post.</em> Apple badly wanted to lock down at least one of them, and it began a vigorous courtship of the papers last spring, not long after the Texture deal closed and Appleâs plans for its content bundle were beginning to materialize, according to people familiar with the matter. âThey put a tremendous amount of pressure on,â one source said. âEddy Cue was in and out of their offices really trying to woo them.â Cueâs elevator pitch, according to people familiar with the discussions, was, âWeâll make you the most-read newspaper in the world.â</p>\n<p>In multiple meetings with top brass at both newspapers, Apple made it clear that they wanted the whole shebang, as opposed to a pared down offering or a specialized sliver of stories. âThey didnât want to have limitations in terms of content,â according to a person with knowledge of the talks. But Apple dangled flexible terms governing the duration after which they could pull out, as well as exclusivity. âYouâd be protected against a competitor coming in,â the same source said. âIf this thing was really successful and everyone else came back to the table, there was a period where youâd have exclusivity.â</p>\n<p>But the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Post</em> couldnât be swayed. Over the past several years, both publications have developed substantial digital subscription businesses that are now vital moneymakers, helping to offset the industryâs advertising collapse. Those businesses continue to grow, and the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Post,</em> put simply, want their own subscribers, not Appleâs subscribers&#8212;and they certainly donât want Apple subscribers if Apple is going to keep a 50 percent cut of the revenues.</p>\n<p>âWeâve been pretty deliberate about saying that the best place you can experience journalism is through a relationship with a news provider,â <strong>Meredith Kopit Levien,</strong> the <em>Times</em>âs chief operating officer, told me. âSo far for us, that has meant a direct relationship with users. The more we have a relationship with users, the better we think our business will be, and the better the experience that we can provide to them.â <strong>Kris Coratti,</strong> a <em>Post</em> spokeswoman, said, âOur focus is on growing our own subscription base, so joining Apple News+ did not make sense for us at this point. Apple has been a very good partner&#8212;we will continue collaborating with them on other ongoing projects and expect to do many things with them in the future.â</p>\n<p>With the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Post</em> off the table, it was all the more crucial for Apple to sign the <em>Journal.</em> That may have given <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong> and <strong>Robert Thomson,</strong> who run the <em>Journal</em>âs parent company, News Corp., and <strong>William Lewis,</strong> the <em>Journal</em>âs publisher and C.E.O., some added leverage in their own Apple negotiations. âOne of their superpowers is extracting favorable terms for themselves in exchange for going in on an announcement like this,â someone who used to work for them told me. âItâs impossible to imagine that the arrangement between Apple and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> is not a sweet one for the <em>Journal.</em>â</p>\n<p>On first inspection, it does look pretty sweet. The <em>Journal</em> was able to negotiate a deal in which it is technically giving away all of its content for $9.99 a month without <em>really</em> giving it all away for $9.99 a month. (Digital-only <em>Journal</em> subscriptions begin at $19.49 a month for the first year, after which the monthly fee goes up to $38.99.) For one thing, only a limited selection of general news and opinion pieces will be promoted on the <em>Journal</em>âs News+ channel, and those stories will be curated by <em>Journal</em> editors. Moreover, while the rest of the <em>Journal</em>âs content will be accessible on News+, that content has to be searched for, and the archive will only cover the most recent three days. As part of the News+ rollout, the <em>Journal</em> has said it plans to hire several dozen additional journalists. Two sources with direct knowledge of the deal told me Apple is not paying for those jobs. (The <em>Journal</em> and Apple declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>Aside from the manner in which it was able to tailor its News+ presence, the <em>Journal</em> appears to run a lower risk of losing its own subscribers than the <em>Times</em> or the <em>Post</em> would. Many of its customers are corporate accounts and high net-worth individuals who subscribe primarily for the <em>Journalâs</em> smorgasbord of business and finance news, as opposed to the more general coverage the paper has expanded into in recent years, which will be the bedrock of its News+ offering.</p>\n<p>Murdochâs long-standing enthusiasm for Apple was likely a factor in the deal. Murdoch sunk millions of dollars into rushing out an iPad app in a matter of weeks so that the <em>Journal</em> could be a part of the iPadâs April 2010 debut, and he introduced an iPad ânewspaperâ onstage with Eddy Cue in a splashy event at the Guggenheim the following year. He just sold one of his companies (21st Century Fox) for $70 billion, and another (Sky) for $40 billion, and heâs always been a risk-taker anyway. âWhen the herd moves one way, he moves the other, and thatâs always been what heâs done,â another source said. âWhen the media pundits say something is a terrible idea, heâs gonna be more inclined to want to do it, and heâs gotten more bets right than heâs gotten wrong.â Sources also pointed out that while Murdoch and Thomson have taken a hostile stance toward Facebook, Google, and Amazon, they have a cozy relationship with the Apple crew.</p>\n<p>Itâs still too early to say whether Apple News+ will prove to be a blessing or a curse for the media business. âIt feels to me a bit like Spotify in the early days,â said the editor of a prominent digital publication who is watching News+ closely, âwhere thereâs not much money for publishers, the usage is not enormous, but it could eventually become this major revenue source and maker of brands, and potentially even of individual writers. But I donât think it has the scale yet to make most publishers real money, given the economics and the product itself.â</p>\n<p>But if the scale proves to be as irresistible as Apple believes it will be&#8212;the company has more than a billion devices in circulation worldwide and eventually plans to roll out News+ globally&#8212;the holdouts may come to see things differently. âI do not rule out that there will be an opportunity with one or more platforms,â the <em>Times</em>âs Levien told me, âin which we say, âOh, this is really good for our business and for getting journalism to play a bigger role in many more peoples lives.â Thus far, we have not seen something that makes us say that.â</p>","rubric":"Apple News","socialTitle":"âAre We at a Party or a

But on the other hand, he understands that, look, if youâre talking to a New York audience, you canât go full MAGA.â","body":"<p>In the media landscape of the <strong>Donald Trump</strong> era, the <em>New York Post</em> occupies a sui-generis position. It has the longest history with the current occupant of the White House of any publication&#8212;Trump first emerged as a larger-than-life character in the <em>Post</em>âs pages some 30 years ago. The <em>Post</em> is reportedly still Trumpâs favorite and first-read paper, and Trump has a close rapport with its owner, <strong>Rupert Murdoch,</strong> who reportedly talks to the president on a regular basis. In its modern history, the <em>Post</em> has always been seen as a conservative title, with red-meat opinion pages and a special delight in skewering liberal politicians, but it is also very much a New York paper, with a strong constituency of power players in politics, business, and media who lean to the left. âWhen you go to a hotel or to Michaels,â said one veteran political operative, âthe <em>New York Post</em> is almost always an equal with the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Journal,</em>â which Murdoch also owns. âItâs a widely read and deeply influential newspaper.â</p>\n<p>Perhaps more than any other of his American journalistic assets, Murdoch has used the <em>Post</em> to get involved in the political game, put his chips down, and signal his pleasure or displeasure. And just as Murdoch has been confused about Trump, so has the <em>Post.</em> Unlike the overall vibe of the primetime lineup at Murdochâs Fox News, the tabloid hasnât been shy about <a href=\"https://www.showbiz411.com/2018/01/18/conservative-murdoch-papers-ny-post-and-wall-street-journal-go-harder-on-trump-than-anyone\">taking shots at Trump</a> when it <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trumps-1518747258-8f45b439-598b-43da-8456-0adaca44f00a.html\">thinks he deserves it</a>. But the overall effect has been muddy, which, for a tab like the <em>Post,</em> is a problem.</p>\n<p>To help think through how to cover Trump, Murdoch has brought one of his old lieutenants back into the fold. For the past three weeks, former <em>New York Post</em> editor-in-chief <strong>Col Allan</strong> has been drawing a paycheck as a consultant for News Corp., the newspaper-focused arm of the Murdoch media empire. âDonât mind me,â he quipped in his Australian brogue on his first day back at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, as the bespectacled Allan sunk his portly frame into an office chair beside current <em>Post</em> editor <strong>Stephen Lynch</strong> during the daily news meeting. For the rest of the week, according to <em>Post</em> sources, Allan worked out of a 10th-floor conference room next to the <em>Post</em>âs business desk, where he could be seen poring over newspapers, with his TV tuned to Fox News or the Golf Channel. Last week, Allan traveled to the companyâs London Bridge offices next to mega-tower the Shard for a swing through News UK, which includes <em>The Sun</em> and <em>The Times</em> of London. This week, Allan has been back in New York, where he piped up briefly during a news meeting when the discussion turned to the <em>Post</em>âs coverage of the <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>-A.M.I. imbroglio, one of my sources told me. The rank and file doesnât seem to know exactly what heâs doing, but thereâs immense curiosity&#8212;and a dash of fear. Newer <em>Post</em> staffers who never got a taste of Allanâs jocular-meets-tyrannical management style quickly started Googling old news stories about him. âThereâs more of a chill with his return,â another insider said. âNobody knows what it all means.â</p>\n<p>Allan is a documented Trump supporter who was <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/ny-post-editor-allan-wears-trump-hat-newsroom-article-1.2572467\">photographed</a> in a MAGA baseball cap during the 2016 campaigns, which led many to believe that Murdoch must have brought him back to âFoxifyâ the Post, to borrow a term used by two sources close to the paper.</p>\n<p>The situation seems to be a bit more nuanced than that. In conversations heâs had with people at the <em>Post,</em> one insider told me, Allan has talked about how the tabloid needs to carve out its position on Trump, while also acknowledging that it has a large audience in deep blue New York City. âOn the one hand,â this person said, âheâs a Trumper. But on the other hand, he understands that, look, if youâre talking to a New York audience, you canât go full MAGA. You have to be strategic about how you do this. You canât just be all Fox News.â Representatives for News Corp., the <em>Post,</em> and Murdoch didnât comment.</p>\n<p>There was a time, not even all that long ago, when the top brass of New Yorkâs tabloids were seen as being as consequential and worthy of scrutiny as any of the cityâs big shots. That was especially true of Allan, the fearsome, pugilistic, bibulous Aussie newspaper legend who ran the <em>Post</em>âs newsroom for 15 years starting in 2001. For much of that time, Allan loomed large in the New York media fishbowl, whether it was a <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/page-sex-article-1.239026\">drunken lap-dancing debacle</a> with a future Australian prime minister; a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/new-york-post-marathon_n_3110673.html\">wildly controversial tabloid wood</a>; or an <a href=\"https://gawker.com/5709288/new-york-post-political-editor-quits-after-fight-with-tyrant-boss\">expletive-laden blowup with one of his editors</a>. âIâll get fired not because Rupert doesnât like the stories I put in the paper. Iâll get fired because we donât sell newspapers,â Allan told <strong>Lloyd Grove</strong> in a memorable 2007 <em>New York</em> magazine <a href=\"https://nymag.com/news/media/37257/index4.html\">profile</a>. âAnd that judgment is made not by Rupert, but by the market, and by the audience. And I think thatâs pretty democratic. I like that deal.â</p>\n<p>By the time Allan did, in fact, leave the <em>Post,</em> in 2016, the tabloids were no longer the towering institutions they once were, and Allanâs retirement at the age of 62, though it generated some news coverage, was hardly an earth-shattering event. Allanâs handpicked successor, Lynch, assumed the top masthead role, while <strong>Jesse Angelo,</strong> a former Allan deputy and fellow longtime Murdoch consigliere whoâd become the <em>Post</em>âs publisher and C.E.O., forged ahead with his ambitious digital turnaround strategy to help stem the publicationâs famously prodigious losses. For the most part, the status quo carried on, business as usual.</p>\n<p>That all changed on January 17, with the abrupt and surprising announcement that Angelo was leaving the <em>Post</em> and News Corp. after 20 years. Angelo, it turned out, had learned about News Corp.âs decision to appoint a digital editor-in-chief for the <em>Post,</em> and also that the company was going to bring Allan back in an advisory role. As people familiar with Angeloâs thinking <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch\">told me</a> at the time, he wasnât on board, and he exited the company amid concerns regarding the direction in which he believed the <em>Post</em> was heading both digitally and politically. (Angeloâs main digital deputies, <strong>Remy Stern</strong> and <strong>Neil Nagraj,</strong> have also departed.) Newsroom managers have since communicated to staff that Murdoch wants to ditch the type of catchall generic viral content that helped significantly juice nypost.comâs Web traffic, and to refocus more on stories that are âon brandâ with the <em>Post,</em> as someone familiar with the conversations put it.</p>\n<p>Allan, for his part, is apparently no longer the baddest beast in the tabloid jungle. Heâs been âfriendly and nice,â one of my sources said. âHeâs not the boss anymore, so he doesnât need to be scary.â</p>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"Col Allan Is Back to Help Figure Out the Postâs Trump Coverage","socialDescription":"Can Col Allan, the swashbuckling and bibulous tabloid star of the aughts, help the New York Post decode its most important reader?

But his surprise departure from the <em>Post</em> suggests fears over the return of an old battle-axe editor with Trumpian tendencies.","body":"<p>On Thursday evening, <strong>Rupert Murdochâs</strong> News Corp issued a surprising press release announcing that mustachioed <em>New York Post</em> boss <strong>Jesse Angelo</strong> would be âdeparting the company.â He is to be replaced as publisher and C.E.O. of the <em>Post</em> by Chief Revenue Officer <strong>Sean Giancola,</strong> according to the announcement, which also revealed the elevation of managing editor <strong>Michelle Gotthelf</strong> to the new position of digital editor in chief. The days when tabloid personnel shifts were seen as big news are long gone, but Angelo is a different story&#8212;the type that merits, say, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/336e0c04-1aa3-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21\">write-up in the <em>Financial Times</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Angelo, after all, is a media darling of a bygone age. He was <strong>James Murdochâs</strong> kindergarten bestie, and later, his best man&#8212;a veritable fifth (and then seventh) Murdoch kid, who worked his way up the ladder at various enterprises within the family business. He did a U.K. tour at <em>The Sun</em> during a year off from Harvard, and after graduation, he landed at Australiaâs <em>Daily Telegraph.</em> Angelo joined the <em>Post</em> in 1999 and swiftly ascended the ranks, becoming the paperâs top business executive in 2012, and ushering in an era of digital growth for the famously money-losing News Corp tabloid. In 2011, when News Corp launched an ambitious but short-lived iPad publication called The Daily, Rupert chose Angelo as its editor in chief. In 2017, when Roger Ailes was ousted from Fox News, Angeloâs name briefly surfaced as a possible contender to run the network. That same year, he was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/tipsheets/morning-media/2017/03/sxsw-kicks-off-with-media-politics-bigs-on-taph-h-make-game-change-trilogy-officialjesse-angelo-on-the-ups-at-news-corp-001232\">given an additional brief</a> overseeing a major digital-advertising initiative at News Corp, which owns newspapers all over the world, leading to speculation that Angelo could very well end up running the whole company some day. Now, suddenly, he was out. âAfter 20 years at the <em>Post,</em> it is time for me to move on and let someone else write the next chapter,â Angelo said in the News Corp release. âI will always be thankful to Rupert.â</p>\n<p>Media watchers quickly assumed there was more between the lines, and it appears their instincts were correct. âThis went down very fast,â someone with direct knowledge of the situation told me. Other sources with direct knowledge of the situation told me that Angelo learned in recent days not only of Gotthelfâs expanded digital role, but also about talks to bring back former <em>Post</em> editor in chief <strong>Col Allan,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/04/new-york-post-editor-in-chief-col-allan-is-retiring-004480\">retired</a> in 2016 and was succeeded by <strong>Stephen Lynch,</strong> in an advisory capacity. These moves signaled change that Angelo wasnât driving, which created conflict, and he saw them as a diversion from the direction the <em>Post</em> had taken under his watch, according to sources familiar with his thinking.</p>\n<p>In Allanâs case, the talk of his return wasnât just a potential digital-strategy hindrance&#8212;it also looked like it could be an omen for editorial coverage. âCol coming back is like giving the keys to a Ferrari to a teenager,â said one source with knowledge of how it all went down, adding that if Allan does indeed come back as an adviser, âThe <em>Post</em> will certainly get more on the Trump bandwagon.â (Angelo didnât return text messages or a call. Reps for the <em>Post</em> and News Corp didnât have comments. Allan could not be reached.)</p>\n<p>Allan, a pit bull of a tabloid editor if there ever was one, was a mentor to Angelo. He was editor of the <em>Telegraph</em> back when Angelo was a cub reporter there; after Allan took the reins of the <em>Post</em> in 2001, Angelo became one of Allanâs top newsroom lieutenants. But they also clashed over strategy, as Allan resisted the Web-first gospel that Angelo and his digital team were preaching. Additionally, itâs worth noting that Allan is a documented Trump cheerleader&#8212;he was notably seen <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/ny-post-editor-allan-wears-trump-hat-newsroom-article-1.2572467\">sporting a MAGA baseball cap</a> in the <em>Post</em> newsroom during the 2016 campaigns.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Post</em> has always leaned right tonally under Murdoch&#8212;particularly in its fire-breathing opinion pages&#8212;Murdoch and Trump are known to speak regularly, and members of the newsroom, according to someone familiar with the dynamic, suspect that the <em>Post</em> might become more of a Trump mouthpiece as the 2020 election season heats up. The opinion programming at Murdochâs American cable-news powerhouse is already a veritable mouthpiece. But <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> which Murdoch also owns, has broken a string of big stories that are problematic for Trump, and there have been instances where its conservative editorial pages were sharply critical of administration policy.</p>\n<p>Palace intrigue aside, the timing of Angeloâs departure coincides with another professional narrative. For the past few years, James Murdoch has been out of the loop at News Corp, which is run by Rupert and Jamesâs brother, <strong>Lachlan,</strong> and instead focused on his role as C.E.O. of sister company 21st Century Fox. And with 21CFâs sale to Disney entering the home stretch, James will soon be a free agent. As I <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/james-murdoch-post-fox-plans\">reported</a> in September, James has taken an office in downtown Manhattan, which is expected to serve as the command center for his post-Fox career, which a source told me will likely involve investing âin a handful of effortsâ in media, tech, and other areas. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-16/james-murdoch-is-said-to-set-up-family-office-as-fortune-swells\">confirmed</a> the establishment of Murdochâs office earlier this week, reporting that it would have a staff of about 10 people.</p>\n<p>After Angeloâs News Corp departure was announced, multiple media insiders immediately speculated to me that he would join James in his new endeavor&#8212;a move that seems almost like a plot arc from <em>Succession.</em> But people who know both men told me thatâs not in the cards right now. Instead, those who know Angelo say they wouldnât be surprised if he ended up veering into the television realm. One of his big projects over the past couple of years was selling a show to the Fox stations based on the <em>Post</em>âs legendary gossip franchise, Page Six. (Side note: Angeloâs wife, <strong>Rebecca,</strong> is a former journalist-turned-television writer.)</p>\n<p>In a farewell statement, News Corp C.E.O. <strong>Robert Thomson</strong> said, âWe thank Jesse Angelo for his many and varied contributions to our company as a journalist, editor, and publisher, and for his leadership during the digital transformation of the <em>Post.</em>â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Lessons from the âTrump and the Mediaâ <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/everything-i-learned-in-the-university-of-toronto-course-on-donald-trump?inline\">class at University of Toronto</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; An unsparing <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jill-abramson-dishes-about-new-media-and-her-tumultuous-times-years?inline\">look at <em>The New York Times</em></a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A wild mystery <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-mystery-of-salvator-mundi?inline\">surrounding the worldâs most expensive painting sold at auction</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; âI come from generations of unfulfilled womenâ <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/glenn-close-golden-globes-the-wife-oscars-interview?inline\">&#8212;Glenn Close</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Jared and Ivankaâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-movie-date?inline\">curious movie date</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"Intrigue in Murdoch-Land After an Abrupt Executive Exit","socialDescription":"Jesse Angelo was basically part of the Murdoch clan.

But according to a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house\">new report</a>, thatâs precisely what <strong>Donald Trump</strong> did, in an apparent effort to hurt CNN and boost his Fox News buddies. Per <em>The New Yorker</em>âs <strong>Jane Mayer,</strong> Trump in 2017 directed then-chief economic adviser <strong>Gary Cohn</strong> and then-chief of staff <strong>John Kelly</strong> to âpressureâ the Justice Department to block a merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, the entertainment conglomerate that owned CNN. âIâve been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothingâs happened!â Trump told Kelly in a meeting at the time with Cohn, according to Mayer. âIâve mentioned it 50 times. And nothingâs happened. . . . I want that deal blocked.â</p>\n<p>Mayerâs reporting would appear to confirm suspicions inside CNN and AT&amp;T at the time. In late November, the D.O.J. sued to block the $85 billion merger, which executives at both companies saw as an essential step toward competing with Netflix and other ascendant streaming platforms. As my colleague <strong>Joe Pompeo</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/political-cnn-trump-hand-in-justice-department-merger-crackdown\">wrote</a>, sources at both companies believed the lawsuit was not driven by anti-trust concerns, but by politics. CNN remains a great source of frustration for the president, who frequently calls the cable network âfake news.â The speculation was that Trump was using his influence over the D.O.J. to force AT&amp;T to divest itself of CNN. But AT&amp;T C.E.O. <strong>Randall Stephenson</strong> was insistent that CNN be part of the deal, and the two sides went to court.</p>\n<p>Cohn apparently agreed that Trumpâs interest in the merger was inappropriate. âDonât you fucking dare call the Justice Department,â Cohn reportedly told Kelly after the meeting at which Trump demanded a lawsuit. âWe are not going to do business that way.â (The Trump administration insists that there was nothing political about the case, which it lost, appealed, and then <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/atandt-execs-can-finally-pop-champagne\">lost again</a>.)</p>\n<p>Mayer documents the lengths to which the president has gone to intervene in the ratings war between CNN and Fox News, whose C.E.O., billionaire <strong>Rupert Murdoch,</strong> unsuccessfully attempted to acquire Time Warner in 2014. She also describes various instances in which Fox News actively sought to boost Trump. In one instance, the late Roger Ailes allegedly tipped Trump to questions heâd be asked at a Republican debate. Another time, the conservative-friendly cable network reportedly spiked a Fox journalistâs early coverage of candidate Trumpâs alleged affair with adult film actress <strong>Stormy Daniels.</strong> (Trump, who paid tens of thousands of dollars to keep Daniels quiet, claims there was no sexual relationship.) The reporter, <strong>Diana Falzone,</strong> had âobtained proofâ about the affair and confirmed it with multiple sources, but her editors didnât want to run it. Former Fox executive <strong>Ken LaCorte</strong> reportedly told Falzone, âGood reporting, kiddo. But Rupert wants Donald Trump to win. So just let it go.â (LaCorte denies this account.)</p>\n<p>The symbiotic relationship between Trump and Fox News, while unseemly, is well-known and largely public. Trump regularly calls into Fox News programs, offers programming advice, maintains close personal relationships with Fox hosts, and has stocked his administration with Fox News alumni. His alleged interference in the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, however, may constitute an abuse of power. âIf proven, such an attempt to use presidential authority to seek retribution for the exercise of First Amendment rights would unquestionably be grounds for impeachment,â <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1102544748886310913\">tweeted</a> Trump critic <strong>George Conway,</strong> a conservative attorney who is married to Trump adviser <strong>Kellyanne Conway.</strong> Impeachment is surely a ways off. At the very least, the presidentâs interest in the merger is another tantalizing investigatory target for Democrats in the House. Theyâre already investigating <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/432469-dems-unleash-sprawling-probe-of-trump-family-administration\">just about everything else</a>.</p>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"Trumpâs Alleged Meddling with CNN Could Be an Impeachable Offense","socialDescription":"The president reportedly demanded the Justice Department file

Zanuck, who merged Twentieth Century Pictures with William Foxâs ailing studio&#8212;and booted out Fox in the process&#8212;to create a formidable Hollywood player. It was the studio that turned Marilyn Monroe into a star, awarded Elizabeth Taylor her first $1 million payday (for the costly Cleopatra, which at $44 million nearly capsized the company), and helped solidify the modern-day blockbuster with George Lucasâs space fantasy, <em>Star Wars.</em> Along the way, Fox experienced all the highs and lows of the burgeoning Hollywood system, from breaking box- office records with the 1965 hit <em>The Sound of Music</em> to earning 14 Oscar nominations for <em>All About Eve,</em> to Zanuckâs 1970 installation of his son, Richard, as the president of production, only to fire him in a move that would lead to his own ousting by a seething board of directors. And this was all before Rupert Murdoch bought the studio in 1985, launched the Fox Broadcasting Network along with Barry Diller, and doubled down on the Jim Cameron business, green-lighting and supporting the mercurial director through all his production-budget overages on the way to a $2.2 billion worldwide gross for 1997âs <em>Titanic</em> and $2.8 billion for 2009âs <em>Avatar.</em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Cameron canât save everybody. The business climate in Hollywood has shifted in recent years, and studios are competing not just with each other but with a handful of ruthless Silicon Valley interlopers. New alliances have been forged out of desperation, none of them bigger than the $71.3 billion acquisition, which was set to close last month, that saw the Walt Disney Company absorb the once indomitable Fox. The deal could eventually result in the loss of anywhere from 4,000 to 10,000 jobs, depending on whom you ask.</p>\n<p>The situation has had longtime employees on the Fox lot suffering a kind of prolonged trauma since the merger was announced, in December 2017. To hear them tell it, they are being issued mostly vague, Orwellian-lite guidance that outlines dress codes and explains key-card access, but they have been left wanting in terms of business directives. In the middle of February, Foxâs marketing and distribution departments gathered with the filmmakers of <em>Dark Phoenix,</em> the latest <em>X-Men</em> installment from producer-director Simon Kinberg, to lay out their plans for the filmâs June release. It was a typical meeting. Ad buys were discussed, and the publicity tour for the filmâs stars, including Sophie Turner, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jessica Chastain, was laid out. But it was still disconcerting, both because of all the new faces in the room&#8212;a handful of high-end consultants have been hired temporarily to fill the jobs recently vacated by long-term employees&#8212;and because of the ad hoc approach the Fox marketing team was taking toward the filmâs release, four months away.</p>\n<p>âWe know when we are dropping a trailer, but we are nowhere near where we should be at this time,â said one marketing exec who was at the meeting. âItâs frightening. I would be mad if I were a filmmaker.â</p>\n<p>âWhatâs not normal is the elephant in the room, which is that most people there are not going to be the people that are still in the job when the movie opens,â added another attendee.</p>\n<p>âNobody has come around and said, âThis is whatâs going on.â Why canât they just tell us that there is no place for us? Why canât they let anyone know?â said the marketing exec. âWe are not leaving because we didnât make money for the company or we did a bad job. We are leaving because of pure capitalism.â</p>\n<p><strong>You know somethingâs</strong> screwy when the marketing department is crying capitalism. But such is life, not just on the Fox lot but all around Hollywood these days&#8212;or at least since Netflix dropped the entire first season of <em>House of Cards</em> on its unwitting customers six years ago. It took a while for Hollywood to figure it out, but when the biggest filmmakers in the world&#8212;Martin Scorsese, Alfonso CuarÃ³n, and nearly everyone this side of Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan&#8212;started taking their expensive, theatrical films to the streamers, the town realized the business was in the throes of a disruption so large it would never be the same again. That position was cemented in stone on Oscar Sunday this year when <em>Roma</em> landed three Academy Awards&#8212;for best director, cinematography, and foreign-language film. All the hand-wringing for the past five years over the threat to the sacred theatrical business and the uproar over Netflixâs spending seemed to have found its culmination in the loss of Fox. The big six studios, which have histories that pre-date most mail-room internâs grandparents, are now down to five&#8212;and the consolidation is likely not over yet.</p>\n<p>âThe new platforms are exploding every day, but the theatrical world is never going to see a new studio emerge,â said one veteran filmmaker with ties to both Disney and Fox. âItâs all going to be moving towards direct-to-consumer.â</p>\n<p>Says another executive, âSilicon Valley has declared their hostility to the existing order and their desire to replace it. Their point of view is not co-existence. They think in terms of winner take all.â</p>\n<p>Such sentiment isnât exactly bleeding-edge media theory at this point, but the Fox acquisition is its greatest manifestation yet &#8212;even physically. Take the future of Foxâs lot, 53 acres of perfectly manicured prime Los Angeles real estate, once an even more sprawling 176 acres that included most of what is Century City today. The property still features a giant rendering of Julie Andrews from <em>The Sound of Music</em> alongside Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker dueling with light sabers. Recently, I spoke to film historian Leonard Maltin, who remembered the days he could take out-of-town friends onto the lot to see the remains of the fantastical elevated train station that served as a background element to Barbra Streisandâs big number âBefore the Parade Passes By,â in <em>Hello, Dolly!</em> âYou could take them over there, and drive them onto the property and see a bit of Hollywood magic,â he said wistfully. With the deal closed, the Fox lot will soon become a rental space for Disneyâs new film labels and the headquarters for New Fox, which will now include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, and its TV stations. Employees, some of whom have been there since the days of the <em>Dolly</em> set, are watching their beloved logos and ephemera disappear from sides of buildings all around the lot. âThey are whitewashing the place of everything Fox,â said one rueful longtime executive.</p>\n<p><strong>Fox may have</strong> never been the largest studio, but it took some big swings on films that Disney would have been unlikely to back, even recently. Thereâs Ang Leeâs <em>Life of Pi</em>, Ridley Scottâs <em>The Martian,</em> and James Mangoldâs <em>Logan</em>. The biggest source of Hollywoodâs anxiety around the deal lies in that cold reality: the industry has just lost itself a big buyer of traditional content, and one that took chances on films to the left of center. Or at least occasionally in a very non-Disney marketing vector. Hugh Jackman as P. T. Barnum in <em>The Greatest Showman</em> comes to mind; so does the profane, and essentially anti-Disney, <em>Deadpool</em> franchise, which has now grossed $1.5 billion worldwide and was initially a huge risk anchored by Ryan Reynolds, a lead who had previously bombed with <em>Green Lantern</em>. Twentieth Century Fox once produced between 12 and 20 movies a year&#8212;2018 highlights included <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> and <em>Deadpool 2</em>. It will now be reduced to a label inside Disney, run by Fox Filmâs vice-chairman, Emma Watts, and will make a fraction of that. Some predict as few as three to five Fox films will be released theatrically each year, a figure that has everyone around town reaching for the Xanax. Disney C.E.O. Bob Iger told audiences at the <em>Vanity Fair</em> New Establishment Summit in October that he âlikes taking big risks.â To date, his biggest risks easily tie into Disneyâs theme parks and massive merchandising operations.</p>\n<p>âThatâs a scary thing for sellers,â said one top veteran agent. âYou used to have two really significant buyers. But Disney just narrowed their lane [in regard to the type of content it produces]. Will Fox do that too? Everyone is asking if Disney would have made <em>Deadpool 2</em>. I want to know if they would still make <em>Walk the Line</em> or <em>Romeo and Juliet.</em> I donât know.â</p>\n<p>In the near term, Disney, already with 26 percent of the theatrical box office, will rely on Foxâs larger-budgeted projects to fill out its slate, movies like the follow-up to <em>Murder on the Orient Express,</em> which is set to start filming in the fall&#8212;and Cameronâs <em>Avatar</em> sequel, set to bow in December 2020. (Disney has the largest market share, but it doesnât release as many films as, say, Warner Bros. or Universal.) Other, smaller films initially slated to be part of Foxâs theatrical-release calendar are likely to be shuttled to Disneyâs new streaming service, which is set to launch in late 2019. One likely casualty, observers guess, will be Josh Booneâs Marvel spin-off, <em>The New Mutants,</em> starring <em>Game of Thrones</em> heroine Maisie Williams. Its moderate budget, younger cast, and smaller spectacle make it the perfect title to send directly to consumers. Itâs a proposition filmmakers all over town need to start getting used to.</p>\n<p>Said the filmmaker, âThe notion of something being for the big screen versus a streaming platform, when you have something like <em>Roma</em> out there, itâs hard to be a filmmaker and to still believe that your nostalgia for a theatrical experience is somehow superior to the way people want to watch movies today.â</p>\n<p>Disneyâs quest to re-invent its streaming services means a handful of the specialty brands at Fox are receiving a much-coveted lifeline. Fox Searchlight, the makers of such Oscar fare as <em>The Favourite</em> and <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?,</em> will be getting a seat at the Disney table, as will Fox 2000, the home of book-to-film adaptations such as <em>Love, Simon</em> and <em>The Hate U Give,</em> and cable channels like FX Networks (<em>The Americans, Atlanta</em>) and Nat Geo, which just landed a best-documentary Oscar for <em>Free Solo</em>. While those at Big Fox are crying in their cornflakes, wondering just how numbered their days are at the freewheeling studio, the execs at the chosen divisions are practically giddy with excitement for whatâs to come. âStreaming services are growing, and if you are going to be a best-in-class company you have to address the realities of the market. Iâm excited to be a part of that,â said FX C.E.O. John Landgraf, whoâs a frequent critic of Netflixâs assault on his business and has been buoyed by Disneyâs indication that his programming is to be a big part of the companyâs Hulu strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>All of this,</strong> of course, only portends more change and further questions. Will the exhibition business do its own consolidating? Are there any plans to shutter some of the 41,000 screens that make up the nationwide theater business? Some around town are lamenting how much sway Disney will have over those exhibitors once it controls between 35 and 40 percent of the market share. The theater chains are already fighting with Netflix, which has zero interest in putting movies in theaters ahead of its platform. âDisney will control a massive amount of the films that go through the theaters and will be able to dictate terms to exhibitors,â said one content provider. âThatâs probably bad for the exhibitors.â</p>\n<p>John Fithian, the head of the National Association of Theater Owners, is much more bullish about his constituentsâ future at the hands of Iger and Co., calling the studio âthe most solid believer in the exclusivity of theatrical runs.â</p>\n<p>âFor that reason alone it couldnât be a better company to grow,â he said. âThatâs even more apparent when you contrast them with Netflix.â</p>\n<p>With all this change, itâs no wonder anxiety is running high on the Fox lot. The disruption, as it were, has only just begun. And thatâs sad both because of all the jobs that will go away and because of just how drastically the business of moviemaking has changed. But this wouldnât be Hollywood without the opportunist angle. âIf you want to stay relevant, you have to have product that people want to see thatâs easily accessible when and where they want to see it,â said the agent. âThis Disney deal is forcing Netflix to build up its own content. The same can be said for Amazon. So itâs good for the sellers in that respect. Itâs good for the artists, too. Itâs good for everybody except those that only want to make movies with the five studios. Itâs just not going to be that way. If you are stuck in that mentality, itâs going to be very lonely.â</p>","rubric":"Letter from L.A.","socialTitle":"Inside Hollywoodâs Disney-Fox Freakout","socialDescription":"With the biggest

But he might want to consider how Nixonâs attempt to quash a corporate merger led him to face impeachment.","body":"<p>As weâve all discovered, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is not really up on his American history. Apparently, he never was much of a student, which is probably why he was so desperate to have his former fixer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> threaten his former academic institutions, plus the College Board, into never publicly releasing his grades and test scores.</p>\n<p>Itâs too bad, really, that Trump operates in his ahistorical vacuum chamber. Because if he had any inkling of the events from a half-century ago, during the ignominious presidential reign of Richard Nixon, he would probably have thought better of ordering <strong>Gary Cohn,</strong> the former Goldman Sachs president who became Trumpâs first director of the National Economic Council, and <strong>John Kelly,</strong> his then-chief of staff, to get the Justice Department to block the proposed merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. As <em>The New Yorker</em>âs <strong>Jane Mayer</strong> recently <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house\">reported</a>, Trump called Cohn and Kelly into the Oval Office in late summer 2017, turned to Kelly and said, âIâve been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothingâs happened! Iâve mentioned it fifty times. And nothingâs happened. I want to make sure itâs filed. I want that deal blocked!â Cohn, at least, had the good judgment to know that was a big mistake. âDonât you fucking dare call the Justice Department,â he reportedly said to Kelly on the way out of the Oval. âWe are not going to do business that way.â</p>\n<p>Actually, Cohn was wrong; that is how Trump does business. In November 2017, the Justice Department filed a suit to block the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger&#8212;a suit it eventually lost at the district level, and then again at the appellate level. Trumpâs motivation for wanting to block the merger seems clear: he detested CNNâs coverage of him and wanted to make life difficult for Time Warner, its parent company. In his way, he also wanted to help his friend <strong>Rupert Murdoch,</strong> the owner of the Fox Broadcasting Company&#8212;a.k.a. Trump TV&#8212;by trying to thwart a competitorâs strategic agenda. Meanwhile, Trump didnât make a peep when Murdoch sold 21st Century Fox, a $71 billion deal, to Disney&#8212;in fact he offered his congratulations to Murdoch. Trumpâs F.C.C. also blocked Sinclair Broadcast Groupâs proposed merger with Tribune Media, a deal that would have threatened the primacy of Murdochâs Fox Broadcasting&#8212;the business the family is keeping after the sale of its Hollywood assets to Disney&#8212;in the conservative-broadcasting market.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, many of Trumpâs bizarre machinations in the AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal were foreshadowed a half-century earlier by Nixon and his interjection into ITTâs proposed $1.5 billion acquisition of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, at the time the largest corporate merger in American history. Like AT&amp;T, ITT was a conglomerate and a serial acquirer. Begun in 1920 as International Telephone &amp; Telegraph, it would eventually oversee a portfolio of manufacturing, service, and financial businesses. Richard McLaren, the head of the Justice Departmentâs anti-trust division in the nascent Nixon administration, was determined to thwart ITTâs ambitions. He decided to take a stand against ITTâs proposed acquisition of the Hartford, as it was known, along with two others.</p>\n<p>Despite McLarenâs clear objective to slow the growth of conglomerates, ITT decided to buy the Hartford, and signed a merger agreement on April 9, 1969. On June 23, the D.O.J. said it would oppose the deal. On November 10, ITT closed the acquisition anyway. In May 1970, the Justice Department reiterated its intention to sue ITT to unwind the deal&#8212;in much the same way that Trump wanted his Justice Department to block AT&amp;Tâs acquisition of Time Warner&#8212;kicking off more than a year of furtive and private negotiations between Harold Geneen, the ITT C.E.O., and John Mitchell, the attorney general, on the one hand; and <strong>Felix Rohatyn,</strong> ITTâs financial adviser at Lazard, and Richard Kleindienst, the deputy attorney general and McLarenâs boss, on the other. Kleindienst had been put in charge of the ITT matter after Mitchell supposedly recused himself because his former law firm had done business with ITT. (Of course, Mitchell did not really recuse himself.)</p>\n<p>Nixon, however, wanted ITT to be able to keep the Hartford, in large part because Geneen was his friend and loyal supporter, and also because ITT had secretly contributed $400,000 to his re-election campaign&#8212;a gargantuan sum at the time&#8212;to convince the Republican Party to locate the 1972 national convention in San Diego. (Once the payoff became public, the convention was moved to Miami.) Nixon didnât want McLaren blocking the merger. In no uncertain terms, Nixon conveyed that message to Kleindienst in an April 19, 1971 phone call. After some pleasantries and Nixonâs acknowledgement to Kleindienst that he understood that Kleindienst was nominally in charge of the ITT matter, he got straight to the point, in Trumpian fashion. (Damn tapes.)</p>\n<p><em>Nixon:</em> I want something clearly understood, and, if it is not understood, McLarenâs ass is to be out within one hour. The IT&amp;T thing&#8212;stay the hell out of it. Is that clear? Thatâs an order.</p>\n<p><em>Kleindienst:</em> Well, you mean the order is to&#8212;</p>\n<p><em>Nixon:</em> The order is to leave the goddamned thing alone. Now, Iâve said this, Dick, a number of times, and you fellows apparently donât get the message over there. I do not want McLaren to run around prosecuting people, raising hell about conglomerates, stirring things up at this point. Now you keep him the hell out of that. Is that clear?</p>\n<p><em>Kleindienst:</em> Well, Mr. President&#8212;</p>\n<p><em>Nixon:</em> Or either he resigns. Iâd rather have him out anyway. I donât like the son of a bitch.</p>\n<p>Of course, Kleindienst could not let Rohatyn (or anybody else at Justice) know that Nixon had ordered him not to unwind ITTâs acquisition of the Hartford. The fiction was allowed to continue for years. The D.O.J. sued ITT to try to force a divestiture, but agreed ultimately to settle for ITT selling a few other businesses instead. It was allowed to keep the Hartford.</p>\n<p>No one would ever have known about Nixonâs intervention but for the enterprising journalism of one <strong>Brit Hume,</strong> who once worked for the syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, the Jane Mayer of his day. Hume and Anderson had gotten wind of the news of ITTâs $400,000 contribution, and together began to put the pieces together about how Nixon seemed to have intervened with the Justice Department on ITTâs behalf. Hume, ironically, is now a Fox News bigwig.</p>\n<p>It was a total mess, needless to say, and the curtain-raiser on the Watergate scandal that followed. In the end, Nixon booted McLaren and made him a federal judge in four hoursâ time&#8212;a process that usually takes months, if not years. For his part, Kleindienst succeeded Mitchell as attorney general, after Mitchell agreed to run Nixonâs re-election campaign. But Kleindienst perjured himself during his confirmation hearing about the role Nixon played in allowing ITT to keep the Hartford, and ended up resigning on April 30, 1973, after less than a year in the job. He pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor of lying to Congress and avoided jail time. But he was the first of a parade of Nixon administration officials to plead guilty in the unfolding Watergate scandal.</p>\n<p>It is not crazy to see the thread that connected ITTâs acquisition of the Hartford, and the ensuing fight for anti-trust approval, to the Watergate scandal and to Nixonâs resignation and the corresponding loss of confidence in the institutions of American government. The blueprint for Nixonâs Watergate cover-up can easily be seen in the lies that Mitchell and Kleindienst uttered before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and in the clandestine, secretly taped conversations of Nixon and his top White House aides about what to do if the shit hit the fan and Nixonâs involvement in helping ITT to keep the Hartford became known, as it eventually did.</p>\n<p>Given the eerie similarities generally between Nixon and Trump, and in this instance specifically, this little nugget of forgotten history might be worth Trump reviewing. Perhaps Brit Hume, now a senior political analyst for Fox News, could work up a special report about Nixon and ITT. We know Trump would be watching.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; How three brothers <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/how-the-gupta-brothers-hijacked-south-africa-corruption-bribes?inline?inline\">hijacked South Africa</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The deepening mystery of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/fordham-confirms-trump-obsessed-with-hiding-sat-scores-cohen-testimony?inline?inline\">Trumpâs SAT scores</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The best <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/good-girls-is-the-best-crime-show-youre-not-watching?inline?inline\">crime show</a> youâre not watching</p>\n<p>&#8212; Is this Trump move an actual, real-life <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/trumps-alleged-meddling-with-cnn-could-be-an-impeachable-offense?inline\">impeachable offense?</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Mergers and Acquisitions","socialTitle":"The Nixonian Roots of Trumpâs CNN Rage","socialDescription":"The president is hardly a student of history.

Why canât we get enough?","body":"<p>Is <strong>Elizabeth Holmes</strong> an intentional liar? Thatâs the question at the center of <strong>Alex Gibneyâs</strong> <em>The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,</em> which aired on HBO Monday night. You wouldnât be wrong to think that itâs a question whose answer is self-evident.</p>\n<p>Holmes was, after all, the visionary founder and chairwoman of Theranos, the health-technology corporation she dreamed up in 2003 while still a 19-year-old Stanford student. It was a company founded on a âWhy didnât I think of that?â-worthy idea, a solution to the problem of slow, impractical, overpriced blood testing. The most famous image of Holmes sums the breakthrough up brilliantly: a youthful but steel-gazed woman in Silicon Valley armor&#8212;a black turtleneck&#8212;holding a tiny red vial in her hands, the tech-brained, disruptive solution to so many of our societal problems.</p>\n<p>It looked too good to be true&#8212;and it was. As has by now been healthily recounted in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\">newspaper</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-exclusive\">magazine</a> articles, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/152473165X/?creativeASIN=152473165X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=Od6jX5Ulyd5FMnNDPVjHqg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=thneyo0f-20\">a book</a>, <a href=\"http://abcradio.com/podcasts/the-dropout/\">a podcast</a>, and two documentaries, Theranos was at the center of a giant grift. In the years since its founding, the company has gone from a roughly 800-person operation valued at $10 billion to the juiciest Silicon Valley story of the 21st century&#8212;and perhaps one of the most instructive.</p>\n<p>Thatâs because, as Gibneyâs documentary posits, Holmes the inventor was herself an invention: a talented and typically overconfident Silicon Valley mind following the credos of her industry&#8212;faking it until she made it, as far as investors were concerned. She moved fast; she broke things.</p>\n<p><em>The Inventor</em> takes a story we largely already know (but, because itâs juicy, donât exactly mind hearing again), and retells it through the voices that have been crafting this narrative all along, including <em>The New Yorker</em>âs <strong>Ken Auletta,</strong> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>âs <strong>John Carreyrou</strong> (whose <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\">bombshell 2015 article</a> first blew the lid off of Theranosâs deception), and <em>Fortune</em>âs <strong>Roger Parloff,</strong> whose <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/\">2014 cover story</a> on Holmes sparked broader public interest in her company. (The documentary was executive-produced by former <em>Vanity Fair</em> editor <strong>Graydon Carter.</strong> <em>V.F.</em> special correspondent <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/inside-elizabeth-holmess-final-months-at-theranos\"><strong>Nick Bilton</strong></a> was a consulting producer.)</p>\n<p>There are other voices, too, of course&#8212;former employees whose consistent details (including a semi-humorous note that Holmes, who insisted on meeting job candidates personally due to her obsession with secrecy, never blinked during their interviews) tell the story of a business that grew increasingly paranoid at having bitten off a larger piece than it could chew. Behind the scenes, Theranos was scrambling to fix ambitious prototypes that werenât finished (and probably could never be) and struggling to amass enough clout with allies like <strong>George Shultz,</strong> <strong>Rupert Murdoch,</strong> <strong>Betsy DeVos,</strong> <strong>General James Mattis,</strong> and even <strong>Henry Kissinger,</strong> to show that broader public trust could be won, even without the company having much of a product to show for itself.</p>\n<p>The Theranos debacle is, undeniably, a story about stories, and Holmes was full of them. Other detailed accounts will tell you that, and Gibneyâs hokier instincts sell it effectively, albeit without adding much depth to what we already know. (The film repeatedly compares Holmes to Thomas Edison, whom Holmes named her faulty blood-testing device after&#8212;another inventor who, as Gibney tells it, talked a big enough game to distract from his failures.) <em>The Inventor</em> also reminds us that Holmesâs claims really were compelling, especially for a country in the midst of a health-care crisis; Gibneyâs film rightly points out that Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, the two companies with a monopoly on the blood-testing business, deserved the shake-up Theranos gave them. One only wishes Holmes had proposed something her company could actually pull off.</p>\n<p>Itâs a good story: the tale of an enterprising young woman with a Steve Jobs vibe (to say nothing of her wardrobe, purposefully modeled on that of the Apple founder) who came to Silicon Valley at precisely the right moment. But as the film shows, this is also a moment in which companies are increasingly delaying their I.P.O.s to avoid greater scrutiny, financial and otherwise. <em>The Inventor</em> is good at giving off the impression of being a thriller about an un-self-aware master scammer&#8212;but the questions it raises go far beyond the issue of Holmes alone.</p>\n<p>Whatâs most troubling, fascinating, even funny about <em>The Inventor</em> is the string of journalists who appear in the film, the same people who have long had a hand in telling this story&#8212;some of whom were responsible for building up the Holmes mythos, despite the lack of proof that Theranosâs technology actually worked. When Holmes lied, she lied to the press, not simply the public. And she lied in a way that, as the documentary suggests, was par for the course in Silicon Valley. This is a culture predicated on making the impossible seem possible, buttressed by investors whose willingness to throw themselves behind people like Holmes suggests that, like the rest of us, they are often as attached to a good story and a charismatic personality as they are to what the numbers say about how to invest.</p>\n<p>Journalists, too, are susceptible to the lure of a good story&#8212;but usually not if it has to come at the expense of the truth. The journalists we hear from in the film, save Carreyrou, are open about having been taken in by Holmesâs earnestness and intelligence. Yet they still trace a fine line between outright lies and the particular deceptions Holmes was known for&#8212;a line that gives Holmes, and the disruption-obsessed culture she represents, certain moral complexity. âDo we believe that she would say, âI knowingly liedâ?â says Auletta, pondering the murky recesses of Holmesâs motivations. âNot for a moment do I believe that she lies in bed at night and thinks, âI was a swindler. I was a crook. I lied.ââ A verklempt Parloff, who seems to have taken Holmesâs untruths especially personally&#8212;he gave her the cover of a magazine, after all&#8212;echoes Aulettaâs remarks. âYou know, I donât know if sheâs lying, or if itâs an unconscious, self-protective, reconstructed reality,â he says. âBut what is coming out of her mouth is not mapping onto reality.â</p>\n<p>Really, does it matter either way whether Holmes is a knowing swindler or somehow oblivious to the truth of Theranosâs deficiencies? This was, to be clear, a scandal in which, through a deal with Walgreens, Theranos customers in Arizona were given dangerously inaccurate medical information&#8212;a scandal involving technology that one technician says put him in danger of being pricked by the companyâs bloody, contaminated, useless apparatus every time he had to fix it (which was often). This was a scandal in which an experienced lab technician was replaced by a dermatologist&#8212;a completely different profession&#8212;and in which a lead scientist on the team committed suicide over the anxiety of having to speak out against Theranos at a patent hearing, according to his own wife.</p>\n<p>Whatâs interesting isnât so much whether Holmes knowingly lied or not, but the fact that journalists, who went so far as to share their interview recordings with Gibney, remain so fascinated with this question. The strange truth of <em>The Inventor</em> is that even now that the breadth of her deceptions has become clear, Holmes still fascinates. The reporters in the film are still surprisingly breathless when describing her meteoric rise and catastrophic fall; they still, even from this vantage, spin stories of her childhood interest in <em>Moby-Dick.</em> To even pose the question of whether her lies count as the worst kind of lies is beside the point. The real fun, Gibney suggests, is in wondering about the things we canât know: Holmesâs inner life and motivation, the person thatâs revealed when we peel back the layers of self-deception that landed her here&#8212;to say nothing of her strategic image-making, in which even <strong>Errol Morris</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielnasaw/status/752473681281085441\">played a part</a>. In the end, Holmes remains the complex, magnetic, repulsive, odd, completely watchable star of a thriller thatâs ongoing. And the rest of us remain her captive audience.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212;  âI will get your child into college.â Inside <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/inside-admissions-scammer-rick-singers-pitch-to-las-elite-parents?inline\">Rick Singerâs pitch to L.A. parents.</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The war that could <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/writers-guild-vs-talent-agencies-hollywood-brexit?inline\">transform&#8212;or tear apart&#8212;Hollywood</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; âI am a fat lady, and I deserve respectâ: <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/shrill-lindy-west-interview?inline\">Lindy West on Huluâs <em>Shrill</em></a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why Jordan Peele <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/us-review-sxsw-jordan-peele-jeremiah-11-11?inline\">might not want you to totally understand <em>Us</em></a></p>","rubric":"Blood Will Out","socialTitle":"Is There Any End to Our Obsession with Elizabeth Holmes?","socialDescription":"Alex Gibneyâs The Inventor examines the Theranos founderâwhoâs already inspired countless articles, a book, a podcast, and another documentary.

Itâs already public knowledge that Trump tunes in to Fox regularly and has his opinions formed by the likes of <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> and <strong>Laura Ingraham.</strong> Nor would it be unexpected that Fox might benefit from a relationship with its most loyal viewer. (Among the articleâs many assertions, Mayer claims that Trump wanted to block AT&amp;Tâs $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which âmany people suspectedâ was a personal rebuke to CNN and his old frenemy, <strong>Jeff Zucker.</strong> The deal went through.) Perhaps some readers were surprised to learn the extent to which the interests of Fox News align with Trump. Some may have been surprised, in particular, to read a passage in Mayerâs piece depicting FoxNews.com editors spiking a story from a reporter about the presidentâs affair with a porn star named <strong>Stormy Daniels.</strong> The reporter was eventually told, âGood reporting, kiddo. But Rupert wants Donald Trump to win. So just let it go.â</p>\n<p>After the storyâs publication, my phone lit up with text messages. After all, I was that reporter. But there isnât much that I can say about the incident in Mayerâs story, because I am subject to an N.D.A. In March 2018, I settled a lawsuit that I brought against Fox News claiming gender and disability discrimination and retaliation. The settlement contained a non-disclosure clause. I was in the middle of a high-risk pregnancy and wanted to move on with my life.</p>\n<p>Requiring employees to sign non-disclosure agreements is a common practice in corporations. N.D.A.s can range from barring an employee from sharing trade secrets, which makes sense, to barring victims of sexual harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation from talking about what happened to them, which can be abusive and dangerous. As a result, N.D.A.s often re-victimize the victim. They enable companies to buy their way out of sexual harassment and discrimination claims, without having to come to grips with the corporate culture that allowed or even encouraged that very behavior. It also prevents current and prospective employees from ever learning about predators within the company who may be in a position to permanently harm their careers, if not their lives. Just think about the harrowing disclosures that would come to light if companies were to waive all N.D.A.s and let the victims tell their stories.</p>\n<p>On Twitter, I posed the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dianafalzone/status/1102621999703171072\">question</a>, âWhen will N.D.A.s be unenforceable against victims of discrimination, harassment &amp; retaliation? More states need to follow NY and CA. Workplaces need to be places of respect.â Reactions were mixed. Some were positive, some negative, just as you might expect. But one question pervaded the conversation: why do the alleged victims of workplace wrongdoings agree to gag orders in the first place? <strong>Nancy Erika Smith,</strong> the employment attorney who represented both <strong>Gretchen Carlson</strong> and myself, told me recently, âI always object to N.D.A.s, and have for 38 years. But employers insist on them in settlement agreements. If my client wants to settle her case and move on with her life, she is forced to accept an N.D.A.â</p>\n<p>Litigation is costly, both financially and emotionally. A year of litigation can cost tens of thousands of dollars just in out-of-pocket expenses, causing already compromised employees to further exhaust their limited resources. While going to trial may allow the facts to become public, that is an unlikely scenario. Few cases actually go to trial, and those that do can take three years or more to get there. During that time, it can be extremely difficult for a plaintiff to find new employment, because prospective employers are reluctant to hire people who have sued their previous employers or are engaged in ongoing litigation. Women who seek justice through the courts are frequently branded as âtroublemakers.â</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs are often accused of litigating only for money, the implication being that their lawsuits have no merit. But monetary compensation is often the only remedy available to employees whose careers have been destroyed. Taking an employer to task can also be a psychologically traumatic experience. âWhen someone has been victimized and needs to seek help through the legal system, any barriers to the legal system can be re-traumatizing because they reinforce feelings of powerlessness,â clinical psychologist <strong>Dr. Chloe Carmichael</strong> told me. Itâs easy to feel victimized by the legal system, alienated by society, and professionally abandoned. Many people simply want to move on. âAfter a while, I realized that everything I had done professionally in my life was being subsumed by the media attention filing a complaint was getting,â one woman, who sued a major corporation for sexual harassment, told me. âI did not want to be known strictly as the woman who filed a high-profile lawsuit against a high-profile man. I wanted to move on and focus on rebuilding my career, and not just on being the latest victim of a man whom the public record had already established as being a serial harasser.â</p>\n<p>After the revelations about alleged serial workplace harassers Roger Ailes and <strong>Harvey Weinstein</strong> surfaced, so did the complicated and imbalanced issue of N.D.A.s. Women came forward to claim that they had been harassed, but were legally barred from speaking out. So much so that New York and California have since passed bills restricting N.D.A.s. The New Jersey Legislature has also passed a bill making N.D.A.s unenforceable against the victim of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. The bill is awaiting New Jersey Governor <strong>Phil Murphyâs</strong> signature. The stateâs senate majority leader, <strong>Loretta Weinberg,</strong> has led the charge, stating that the bill to ban N.D.A.s is an equalizer for the accused and the accuser. âThe bill simply makes any NDA in a settlement agreement unenforceable against the victim,â Weinberg <a href=\"https://www.law.com/njlawjournal/2019/02/22/sen-weinberg-response-to-law-journal-editorial-board-on-nda-bill/?slreturn=20190207141520\">argues</a> in the New Jersey Law Journal. âSome victims may choose to speak up; others may not. If a victim chooses to go public; then the alleged harassed may publicly reply. So the bill is fair to all parties.â</p>\n<p>Most perpetrators of harassment and discrimination donât want to publicly reply. They would prefer that the allegations never see the light of day. And most serial predators would not have become serial predators if their victims were free to speak out. As one victim of sexual harassment put it, âPerpetrators love non-disclosure clauses because it means they can get away with it. Corporations love them because they get to keep making money uninterrupted. The loss of a womanâs hopes and dreams, ambitions, her entire career, her heart, her voice is their gain. How is this not a crime?â Hopefully, more states will follow New York and California, and enact a ban on N.D.A.s. Victims have the right to speak their truth without fear of further retaliation. Silence is not golden. Silence is stifling. Forced silence is demeaning.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; How three brothers <a

But is that enough to motivate Shari?","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The saga of the Redstone family has in recent years become almost post-Shakespearean. For decades, the now 95-year-old <strong>Sumner Redstone</strong> ran his media empire like an omnipotent jefe unwilling to relinquish control. Occasionally, he was visionary. In 2006, when he thought that CBS no longer made sense under Viacomâs protective armor, he spun it out as its own publicly traded company, to be run by programming impresario <strong>Les Moonves,</strong> unlocking billions in new value for investors. Other times, his touch appeared to have atrophied. After Viacom lost out on MySpace, the once-seemingly canât-miss social-media platform, Redstone fired <strong>Tom Freston,</strong> the innovator behind MTV, and replaced him with his protÃ©gÃ© and attorney, <strong>Philippe Dauman.</strong> By 2016, as Viacomâs portfolio of networks dwindled, Redstone moved again. During an examination by the geriatric psychiatrist <strong>Dr. James Spar,</strong> Redstone said that his old lackey was doing a âbad job.â (<em>Les Fagen,</em>_ Daumanâs attorney, argued that Redstoneâs remarks were the product of âmanipulation.â) In a contemporaneous statement, Spar said that Redstone made clear âhe makes all the decisions about Viacom and CBS.â</p>\n<p>Of course, that would soon change, given the patriarchâs declining health and the rise of his once-estranged daughter, <strong>Shari Redstone,</strong> who inherited a very different media environment than the one her father had helped create. For one, his mighty empire was no longer indomitable. Viacomâs top brands, such as MTV and Comedy Central, had receded in the zeitgeist. CBS, while home to incredibly valuable assets such as Showtime and its eponymous television network, no longer appeared large enough to compete with the Silicon Valley streaming behemoths (Netflix, Amazon) and a new generation of Franken-legacy behemoths (AT&amp;Tâs WarnerMedia and Disney+). The media industry had become a game of sharks (and minnows)&#8212;an economic ecosystem that, to steal a line from <strong>Chase Carey,</strong> the former chairman of 21st Century Fox, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/rupert-murdoch-the-media-mogul-says-goodbye-to-much-of-the-company-he-built/2018/07/01/ab546216-7a23-11e8-aeee-4d04c8ac6158_story.html?utm_term=.10fa1abdebdd\">requires</a> either super-scale or uniquely qualitative assets. Shari needed the former. And so she twice embarked upon on a plan to recombine CBS and Viacom, the assets that her father split apart 13 years ago.</p>\n<p>At first, her chief obstacle was Moonves, who didnât want CBS burdened by what he apparently thought were a bunch of tired, market-share-losing cable channels. But Moonvesâs alleged sexual misconduct, reported late last year, eliminated him from the picture. (Moonves has denied wrongdoing.) By the end of last year, Shari appeared to have yet another free path to renew the merger discussions between CBS and Viacom.</p>\n<p>Even opponents have come to admire her tactics. She settled nettlesome lawsuits. She tamed <strong>Joe Ianniello,</strong> Moonvesâs former protÃ©gÃ©, who has been running CBS on an acting basis, and would presumably like to get the gig full-time. She also has had a long and productive relationship with Viacom C.E.O. <strong>Bob Bakish.</strong> And, as the chief representative of National Amusements, which owns nearly 80 percent of the voting stock of both companies, she has presided over the remaking of both companiesâ boards. Her only apparent remaining obstacle, agreed upon as part of Moonvesâs separation agreement from CBS, was a contractual stipulation that National Amusements would not initiate a merger between the two companies until after September 2020. But the boards, and their wise counsel, are no doubt taking comfort from the loophole theyâve found that allows for the conversations to happen because they were not initiated by National Amusements and Shari.</p>\n<p>Word of the latest renewed interest in a recombination between CBS and Viacom came via CNBC, in a piece <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/30/cbs-viacom-discovery-may-merge-for-survival.html\">published</a> January 31. The article also contained a new twist in the saga: Discovery Inc., home to 19 digital channels including the Food Network and OWN, <strong>Oprah Winfreyâs</strong> eponymous network, was also suddenly in the mix of strategic considerations for CBS, either before or after it tried to consummate a combination with Viacom. (Discovery, which denied it is interested in a sale, is partly owned by Advance, CondÃ© Nastâs parent company. Spokespeople from CBS, Viacom, and National Amusements declined to comment for this article.)</p>\n<p>Whatâs behind these various corporate machinations? A mega-merger could allow Shari to find some form of tax-free liquidity for National Amusements and its roughly $5 billion stakes in CBS and Viacom, while also enhancing her chances of becoming a bigger and more powerful media mogul. She knows the CBS television network and Showtime, its premium pay network, are valuable assets in the ongoing media-merger chess matches, and she seems more determined than ever to get as much value as she can for her family, presumably in as tax-efficient a way as possible.</p>\n<p>But unlike a CBS combination with Viacom, a CBS combination with Discovery actually makes sense for CBS shareholders and for CBS. Itâs a conclusion I come by honestly as a onetime Wall Street M&amp;A banker focused on the media and telecom industries. (Donât @ me.) There are a number of reasons why the combination makes sense, and I&#39;ve laid them out here.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>First, there is a nice demographic fit between the two companies, both of which have sizable viewership in the desirable 18&#8211;54 age group, while four of Discoveryâs channels&#8212;HGTV, TLC, Discovery, and Investigation Discovery&#8212;are among the top 20 channels watched on television, according to IndieWire. There is also a nice geographic fit between the two companies: CBS and Showtime are largely domestic networks, while Discovery has a made a large, and reasonably successful, international push through a variety of channels now broadcasting overseas, as well as its ownership of a number of large European broadcast networks, and the rights to broadcast the Olympics in Europe. This could help a combined CBS-Discovery leapfrog over Comcast, which just paid a bundle for Sky, which is mostly a U.K. business.</p>\n<p>Discovery also has the rights to broadcast golf overseas, which would fit well with CBSâs domestic golf prowess. Together, Discovery and CBS could be a global sports juggernaut.The combined company would also have greater clout with advertisers and with the cable giants, where size is essential for channel placements on the dial and for re-transmission fees. Discovery could help Showtime with its streaming presence and it brings more than 8,000 hours of original programming&#8212;on topics such as food, science, and home, to say nothing of Oprah&#8212;to a streaming world.</p>\n<p>To be sure, there are plenty of deal-related obstacles. For instance, would CBS buy Discovery or would Discovery buy CBS, or could some form of merger of nearly equals be constructed? CBS has a market capitalization of around $30 billion, including about $9.5 billion of debt. Discoveryâs market capitalization is about $31 billion, more than half of which is debt. Figuring that out is not hard, and Wall Street investment bankers would salivate at the chance to create a $60 billion-plus media giant.</p>\n<p>One important question for Shari Redstone and the CBS board of directors: who to name as the C.E.O. of the combined company? On the one hand, it should be relatively easy. Discovery C.E.O. <strong>David Zaslav,</strong> who has had the job since 2007, has proven to be a world-class media executive, in the same league as Moonves was, once upon a time. (Their gargantuan pay packages were also similar, with Zaslav, a.k.a. âthe Zas,â racking up total pay of around $112 million in the past three years.) The market would probably dance a jig if Zaslav were named C.E.O. of the combined company.</p>\n<p>One would think Zaslav would be an obvious and welcome choice, given that CBS is currently engaged in a highly publicized C.E.O. search following Moonvesâs departure. (CBS has said the search will be completed by the end of the first quarter.) Alas, the situation is not that simple. (These things often are not.) Ianniello now has a legitimate claim to the job through savvy personnel moves such as naming <strong>Susan Zirinsky</strong> head of CBS News and <strong>Bill Owens</strong> head of <em>60 Minutes.</em> He also has been a calming force around CBS. But Ianniello was Moonvesâs loyal No. 2 and that could be an ongoing problem for Shari, despite his solid performance. She prizes fealty, and has long wanted Bakish to succeed Moonves once CBS and Viacom were combined. She may still want Bakish to lead CBS, and that alone could scotch a CBS merger with Discovery. Certainly Bakish would be much easier for Shari to control than Zaslav.</p>\n<p>Of course, if CBS and Discovery were to combine, there is the obvious matter of what becomes of Viacom in the aftermath. Thatâs not as dire for Viacom as it may seem at first blush. Bakish can continue improving the operations at the company and making bolt-on acquisitions, such as its <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/09/why-viacom-is-buying-pluto-tv.aspx\">interesting purchase</a> of Pluto TV for $340 million. Viacom will live to fight another day, either as part of a rejuvenated CBS-Discovery when the time is right or as part of another media behemoth.</p>\n<p>The bigger question for Shari comes down, once again, to whether she is willing to consider what is best for the non-Redstone CBS shareholders. The Redstones own around 10 percent of the economic interest in CBS (and only a tiny fraction of Viacomâs economic shares), but control what happens at both companies through their voting shares. In the past, Shari has appeared reluctant to take into account the concerns of CBSâs minority shareholders. But if on the off chance she is willing to do that this time, there would be rewards aplenty for all CBS shareholders in a combined CBS-Discovery with Zaslav at the helm. And that should be the main focus of the CBS board, shouldnât it?</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Analysis","socialTitle":"Shariâs Choice: Should Redstone Give Up on a CBS-Viacom Merger?","socialDescription":"A CBS-Discovery deal, led by an established executive, could stoke the markets.

Shaw in New York City. He was astounded to learn about the growth of the Internet&#8212;2,400 percent a year. Bezos decided he had to find a way to take advantage of the demand. He made a list of what he should sell online, eventually settling on books. Along with his wife, MacKenzie, Bezos drove across the country to Seattle, making revenue projections for his company the whole time. In 1994, he incorporated the company as Cadabra but switched to Amazon after a lawyer misheard the original name as âcadaver.â In 1995, Bezos sold the first book  on Amazon.com: Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s <em>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.</em> When Bezos took Amazon public, in 1997, it was an unusual public offering for a tech company at the time. Amazon went public before it ever turned a profit. Bezos didnât expect Amazon to be profitable for several years.\n<p>Bezos popularized online shopping, and even when the dot-com bubble killed off many e-commerce companies, Amazon thrived. Amazon shares have only increased over time, and the company sells everything from clothes and music to cloud-computing services. Amazon has launched a smartphone and TV-streaming box. The company has revolutionized logistics, even reportedly leasing its own planes to move Amazon merchandise, so itâs no longer at the mercy of third-party shippers.</p>\n<p>But Amazon isnât Bezosâs only endeavor. He bought <em>The Washington Post</em> for $250 million in 2013, and Bezosâs space-exploration company, Blue Origin, became one of the first commercial companies to launch a re-usable rocket, and heâll likely keep churning out more creative endeavors with the passing of time. âWhat really matters is, companies that donât continue to experiment, companies that donât embrace failure, they eventually get in a desperate position where the only thing they can do is a Hail Mary bet at the very end of their corporate existence,â he told Business Insiderâs Henry Blodget.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/57436e05614dc9a45cb0a85c_hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","credit":"By David Ryder/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57436e05c1f81aa45c8117ef","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","description":"Getty: 450831356","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/jeff-bezos","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/57436e05614dc9a45cb0a85c_hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","credit":"By David Ryder/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57436e05c1f81aa45c8117ef","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","description":"Getty: 450831356","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"searchable":true,"expired":false,"revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/jeff-bezos","distributionChannels":[{"name":"web-owned-and-operated","metadata":{"searchable":true}}],"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revision":8,"entityId":"57362902ff97be4071973df0"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Jeff Bezos Canât Quit Ghosting Gwyneth Paltrow","promoHed":"Jeff Bezos Canât Quit Ghosting Gwyneth Paltrow","dek":"The Amazon C.E.O. hasnât gotten back to the Goop C.E.O.","promoDek":"The Amazon C.E.O. hasnât gotten back to the Goop C.E.O.","body":"<p><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> was at SXSW this week in the service of her company, Goop. There, speaking with CNN anchor <strong>Poppy Harlow</strong> on Monday morning, she told an audience of the time she was ghosted by Amazon C.E.O. <strong>Jeff Bezos,</strong> newly minted gossip fixture and power bald.</p>\n<p>âIn <em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/gwyneth-paltrow-wants-to-convert-you-1543931659\">The Wall Street Journal</a>,</em> they asked me about my mentors, like you have, and I said, âOh sometimes I, like, cold call people,â and they said, âWell, has anyone not called you back?â And I said, âYes, Jeff Bezos,ââ she started her woeful tale.</p>\n<p>Wait a second. Famous, wealthy people with excellent muscle articulation just e-mail each other and <em>set up a coffee</em>? You can just have the confidence and the access to <em>do</em> that? But cold e-mailing Bezos is actually a normal person thing. See, in 2015, after a searing <em>New York Times</em> story on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html\">Amazonâs corporate culture</a>, Bezos <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/jeff-bezos-if-you-have-a-problem-with-amazon-email-me-1724561248\">wrote an internal e-mail in which he encouraged employees with concerns</a> to e-mail him at jeff@amazon.com. The e-mail was eventually published externally as well, so in addition to employees and Paltrows, customers could reach him at the same address.</p>\n<p>After that, youâd expect Bezos to have gotten overwhelmed, and have a low-level someone else deal with them. Wrong again! He reads them. Or âmostâ of them. âI see most of those e-mails,â he told an audience at the <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/business-insider/amazon-founder-ceo-jeff-bezos-customer-emails-forward-managers-fix-issues.html\">George Bush Presidential Center just last April</a>, during a panel. âI see them and I forward them to the executives in charge of the area with a question mark. Itâs shorthand [for], âCan you look into this?â âWhy is this happening?ââ</p>\n<p>So, surely Paltrowâs reply to his reply came through. So to whom did he forward her missive to with a question mark as if to say, âWhy is this happening?â Thatâs perhaps the biggest mystery here, and weâll likely never know, but anyway, she didnât get an answer at that time. Instead, the <em>WSJ Magazine</em> article came out in December 2018, and their non-exchange got written up <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/jeff-bezos-gwyneth-paltrow-avoiding-emails.html\">here</a> and there, obviously. (Which celebrities even name names anymore, but Paltrow? Bless her.) Allow Paltrow to take it from here: âI got an e-mail and the subject was âJeff Bezos.â And the sender was Jeff Bezos! The body of the e-mail said, âHi there Gwyneth, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> told me you wanna talk to me.â So, I wrote him back and then he wrote me and then I said, âI would die for the opportunity to sit down and ask you a bunch of questionsâ . . . and he never wrote me back.â Twice ignored. Twice scorned. Of course, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/jeff-bezos-mackenzie-divorce-partners-in-ventures\">Bezosâs life got a little complicated around that time</a>, so perhaps it was not her, it was him.</p>\n<p>Is ghosting in the business sector the same as relationship ghosting, or do we need another word for it? Like <em>automating</em> the relationship? Is that something? Like, you set it and forget it or . . . something? What about <em>warehousing</em>?

Jeff Bezos, to say the least, is having a rough start to the year. But donât expect him to lose focus. That was Bezosâs message during Amazonâs internal all-hands staff meeting last week, when an employee asked the C.E.O. if any significant changes are expected because of everything thatâs happened to him over the last two months. Bezos is currently facing an impending divorce, a tabloid scandal and a publicity nightmare stemming from HQ2â²s pullout from New York, among many other things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âIf you donât mind, just raise your hand, if maybe&#8212;just maybe&#8212;youâve had a better start to your 2019 than I have. Anybody?â Bezos said, according to a recording of the meeting CNBC has heard. âI noticed that a couple hands didnât come up&#8212;Iâm sorry for you guys.â Bezos went on to reassure the employees that he has no plans to step back and is still fully engaged with the day-to-day management of the company. He said: âBut seriously, no. I am as engaged and focused on Amazon as ever. I still tap dance into the office. I get to work with remarkable people. I get to live and work in the future. And thatâs where I like to be, so thank you.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That Bezos was unlikely to be derailed by the <em>National Enquirer</em> scandal was predicted by Wall Street analysts last month, who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/hes-a-genius-wall-street-praises-bezos-for-dick-pic-moxie\">praised the billionaire</a> for his dick-pic moxie. âBezos is an individual who has the capacity to work on multiple fronts at the same time. He doesnât get distracted easily,â <strong>Tom Forte,</strong> an analyst at D.A. Davidson, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/investing/amazon-stock/index.html\">told</a> CNN. âLook at his ability to concurrently advance Amazon, own <em>The Washington Post,</em> and develop Blue Origin from scratch. That has in no way detracted from his ability to run Amazon.â <strong>Norm Conley,</strong> C.E.O. of JAG Capital Management, agreed, saying he would not be selling his shares. Bezos, he added, is âa genius.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; How three brothers <a

But, according to some, Bezos and Sanchez are as close as theyâve ever been. âItâs a legendary romance that will blow your mind as to just how in love they are,â Michael <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/suspected-bezos-leaker-supplies-his-own-theory-about-the-affair\">told me</a> last month. âItâs real,â said another source close to the couple.</p>\n<p>In the days after the <em>Enquirer</em> splashed their affair on its issue that hit the stands on January 10, Bezos and Sanchez stayed apart, as Michael Sanchez says de Becker had advised them to do, but they didnât split up. They discussed meeting on January 18, when Bezos accepted an aviation award in Beverly Hills, a source close to the couple told me&#8212;flying has been central to their romance&#8212;but the date didnât happen. Sanchez went to Cabo in early February. The <em>New York Post</em>âs Page Six <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/22/jeff-bezos-and-lauren-sanchez-have-secret-nyc-rendezvous/\">reported</a> that she returned for a âsecret reunionâ around Valentineâs Day at one of Bezosâs Manhattan properties, and they talked about attending the Oscars together, but Bezos ultimately went to the <em>Vanity Fair</em> party without Lauren (Patrick Whitesell was standing a few feet away). âHe was very relaxed,â said someone who talked to him. He seemed as if he didnât have a care in the world. (Bezos declined to comment. Sanchez didnât respond to an e-mail seeking comment.)</p>\n<p>No matter what else happens, the situation has all the hallmarks of a Trump-era scandal: absurd and darkly lurid and completely overdrawn, with a cast of characters both superpowerful and ridiculous, and with enormous political and journalistic stakes&#8212;not to mention the mid-life crisis of the worldâs richest man. Bezos has transformed markedly in the last few years, shaving the last wisps of hair from his head, upscaling his wardrobe, and developing impressive biceps. Heâs acquired mogul-appropriate toys and hobbies, including owning <em>The Washington Post</em> and space-tourism company Blue Origin. During a February speech in New York, he proclaimed his goal to colonize the solar system with a trillion human beings.</p>\n<p>Bezos has always taken pride in his boldness, and the Medium <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">essay</a> he published four weeks after the <em>Enquirer</em> story was in line with some of his business maneuvers, a jujitsu move whereby he flipped his script from unfaithful cad to upholder of the highest values, standing up to a blackmail attempt by a well-known bully at great personal risk. âMy ownership of <em>The Washington Post</em> is a complexifier,â Bezos wrote. âItâs unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience <em>Washington Post</em> news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy.â He accused the <em>Enquirer</em> of publishing the article about his affair as a favor to Trump and Saudi Arabia, both of whom despise the <em>Post.</em> Bezosâs evidence was e-mails from A.M.I.âs lawyers, threatening to release intimate photographs unless his people stopped saying the <em>Enquirer</em> was motivated by politics, and published a statement there was no basis for the suggestion.</p>\n<p>Since the Medium post, the Bezos side has doubled down on this position. A source close to Bezos told me that de Becker is preparing a 90-page investigative report that will make the case that the <em>Enquirer</em> published the Bezos exposÃ© to curry favor with Saudi investors. Parent company American Media Inc. <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/7d75f13c35724c2bba7ec050c32d12f7\">reportedly lost $72 million last year</a>, and the <em>Enquirer</em>âs circulation fell 18 percent to about 265,000. In January, the company announced they had raised $460 million to refinance its crushing debt load. The theory is that Saudi Arabia, either directly or indirectly, bailed out A.M.I. as a reward for humiliating an enemy of the regime. (De Becker declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>A.M.I. has ample reason to dispute Bezosâs charges, whatever the underlying truth. Pecker has a long-standing relationship with Trump, and the company is dangerously entangled in the <strong>Stormy Daniels</strong> case. If de Beckerâs claims are true, Pecker could be in violation of a non-prosecution agreement with prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. So it makes sense that itâs taking the position that the article was an ordinary gossip story with no political motives, business as usual, paying sources handsomely to drop dimes. A person close to A.M.I. said the source was Michael Sanchez. The person, who says they viewed Michaelâs communications with the <em>Enquirer,</em> told me A.M.I. paid Michael $250,0000 for Bezosâs texts and more than a dozen dick pics. <em>Enquirer</em> editor <strong>Dylan Howard</strong> told de Becker in a phone call that the <em>Enquirer</em> âpaid a lotâ for the Bezos story, according to a person briefed on the conversation.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Until Bezos accused A.M.I. of extortion, Michael was known as a minor player hustling for scraps on the margins of the entertainment industry. He had worked at ICM and MTV before becoming a talent manager and publicist, and his biggest client seemed to be his sister&#8212;a former television host-turned-helicopter entrepreneur who is married to W.M.E. co-C.E.O. Patrick Whitesell. Michael strenuously <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/suspected-bezos-leaker-supplies-his-own-theory-about-the-affair\">denied leaking the photos</a>, but was less declarative when I asked about the texts. âIâm not saying I didnât do <em>something,</em>â Michael told me early in February. âUntil I go under oath, what I can tell you now is that ever since April 20, when I met Jeff, my only goal has been to protect Jeff and Lauren.â</p>\n<p>Michael is trying to have it multiple ways: he claims not to be responsible for the worst of the leaks, but neither are the Saudis, and A.M.I.âs not so bad either. Michael mainly wants to cast blame on de Becker, whom he accuses of exerting control over Bezosâs personal life. The two advisers have been at odds in the press since the <em>Enquirer</em> published its exposÃ©. âLauren calls it a cockfight,â Michael has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/suspected-bezos-leaker-supplies-his-own-theory-about-the-affair\">told me</a>. But Michaelâs protestations that he has only been acting in the service of a great love story is hard to credit, given that, for the Enquirer story, he may have done <em>something.</em> And he has maintained a friendly relationship with A.M.I. for years.</p>\n<p>Michael insists that he âloves Jeffâ and wants his sisterâs relationship to succeed. Over the last year, he maintains that he served as an unofficial adviser to the couple. âI believe their passion for flying is so sincere and so earnest,â he said. It was Bezos, Michael continued, who made the first move. âWhen Jeff made the first pass, Lauren was like, âWhat are you doing? Weâre just friends. Weâre pilots.ââ The couple discussed with Michael what would happen if their love affair leaked, Michael said. âThe three of us had discussed before that, at some point, this was going to be a scandal. My advice was, âLetâs get to the other side.â Our analogy was always that they were landing a 747. I told them, âYouâre both pilots, and youâve never landed a 747, but thatâs what weâre trying to do here.ââ When the <em>Enquirer</em> called Bezos and Sanchez for comment in early January, as I recently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/suspected-bezos-leaker-supplies-his-own-theory-about-the-affair\">reported</a>, Michael says he and the couple even discussed Bezos buying A.M.I.&#8212;the ultimate potential catch and kill.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/6aa44f26-2a80-425b-858d-5507a2cf1c46\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/6aa44f26-2a80-425b-858d-5507a2cf1c46\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

Michael said de Beckerâs judgment is clouded, because he has been trying to break Sanchez and Bezos up to protect <strong>MacKenzie Bezos,</strong> a close de Becker friend. Sanchez says De Becker told Bezos to agree to a 30-day physical separation from Sanchez, and encouraged Bezos and MacKenzie to undergo couples therapy with celebrity therapists <strong>Rae</strong> and <strong>Judy</strong> of Maui Intensives Inc. (Weekly fees start at $12,500, according to their Web site.) âOnce Judy and Rae were hired,â Michael said to me, âI told Lauren, âWatch out. Weâre fucked. Gavin is going to get Jeff back together with MacKenzie.ââ</p>\n<p>In a series of interviews, Michael insisted Trump had no involvement in the leak of the affair. âIâve never spoken to Trump,â he said, adding that he is only casual friends with <strong>Roger Stone</strong>; <strong>Carter Page</strong> is a client. But on Twitter, heâs a vocal Trump supporter. And itâs evident Trump is thrilled by Bezosâs woes: âSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post,â he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1084627451983073280\">tweeted</a> on January 13.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, federal prosecutors will play a role in determining whether Bezos is a victim of blackmail and a political smear, or merely an unfaithful spouse trying to distract from the fact that he was caught cheating. Bezos and Sanchez are certainly star-crossed. But what better way to prove that love is true than a leak of intimate texts and photographs to <em>The National Enquirer</em> and a federal investigation? And on one point, everyone can agree: âAt the end of this, weâre all going to look really, really bad,â Michael said.</p>\n<p><em>This post has been updated.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Inside the chilling <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/inside-elizabeth-holmess-final-months-at-theranos?inline\">final months at Theranos</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Ivanka Trump: Americans want to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, just <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/ivanka-trump-jobs-guarantee?inline\">like me</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Reading between Muellerâs lines: is the story of Russian collusion hiding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-robert-mueller-special-counsel-report?inline\">in plain sight?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Bernie Sanders is already repeating some <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bernie-sanders-already-repeating-some-crucial-2016-mistakes?inline\">crucial 2016 mistakes</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Look at these <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2019/02/inside-the-2019-vanity-fair-oscar-party?inline\">Oscar party photos</a>!</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Bezos Blues","socialTitle":"âWeâre F--kedâ: Inside the Bezos Affair, a Tale of Love, Lust, and Uncertainty","socialDescription":"âAt the end of this, weâre all going to look really, really bad,â says Michael Sanchez.","seoTitle":"âWeâre F--ked.

Michael had worked at ICM and MTV before becoming a talent manager and publicist, and his biggest client seemed to be his sister&#8212;a former television host-turned-helicopter entrepreneur who was married to William Morris Endeavor co-C.E.O. <strong>Patrick Whitesell.</strong></p>\n<p>But Michael Sanchez has since become a central character in the Bezos marriage drama.

On Tuesday, the Associated Press <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/e199a6dd14aa4ac7808f58af842f948e\">reported</a> that de Beckerâs investigation had confirmed that Michael leaked Bezos and Laurenâs intimate text messages. The matter is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/media/jeff-bezos-ami-national-enquirer-fight.html\">being investigated</a> by federal prosecutors.</p>\n<p>In a series of interviews this week, Michael Sanchez carefully parsed his involvement in the imbroglio and provided his own counter-narrative. Specifically, he denied any involvement in the leak of the âbelow-the-belt selfiesâ that are at the core of Bezosâs extortion claim, not to mention a possible crime. âI had <em>nothing</em> to do with leak of the dick pics. Thatâs the important thing,â Michael told me. âI never had access. Itâs clear they were sent to others. There are, like, 20 dick pics. Lauren likely shared them with multiple girlfriends, not in a malicious way, thatâs not her style, but when sheâs in love, she got a kick out of sharing them. One time she tried to show me one and I was like, âWhat the fuck is wrong with you? I donât want to see that!ââ</p>\n<p>Michael was less declarative when I asked if heâd leaked his sister and Bezosâs intensely intimate texts, as the <em>Daily Beast</em> had first reported. (âI love you, alive girl. I will show you with my body, and my lips and my eyes, very soon,â Bezos allegedly wrote.) âIâm not saying I didnât do <em>something,</em>â Michael told me. âUntil I go under oath, what I can tell you now is that ever since April 20, when I met Jeff, my only goal has been to protect Jeff and Lauren.â (A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. Gavin de Becker did not return a call seeking comment.)</p>\n<p>Michaelâs claim that he is acting in Bezosâs best interest is difficult to fathom given that heâs been accused by de Becker as being the leaker and has maintained a friendly relationship with A.M.I. for years. But Michael insisted he âloves Jeffâ and wants his sisterâs relationship to succeed. Over the last year, he said, he served as an unofficial adviser to the couple as they discussed what would happen if their love affair leaked. âThey were talking marriage,â he told me. âThe three of us had discussed before that, at some point, this was going to be a scandal. My advice was, letâs get to the other side. Our analogy was always that they were landing a 747. I told them, âYouâre both pilots and youâve never landed a 747, but thatâs what weâre trying to do here.ââ</p>\n<p>In October, Lauren and Bezos had their first publicity scare when they spotted a paparazzo taking long-lens photos of them from the Santa Monica beach. Then, at dinner at Santa Monica restaurant Capo, Lauren noticed a reporter snapping photos of their table. Michael said they were increasingly nervous when they left the restaurant and Bezosâs car hadnât arrived. âWe were literally standing on the street with Jeff Bezos and his mistress. I got very protective of him. I said, âWe need to get you into an Uber,ââ Michael recalled.</p>\n<p>Two months later, they were outed. On the morning of January 7, Michael was on a Caribbean cruise when he was alerted that the <em>Enquirer</em> had called Bezos and Lauren for comment on their affair. âLauren and Jeff called me like 911. They were terrified,â Michael recalled. According to Michael, they discussed various options regarding how to respond to the story. One option even included Bezos buying A.M.I.&#8212;not such an outlandish consideration given the seriousness of the breach and the fact that, for Bezos, the price of the tabloid company is essentially a rounding error&#8212;to find out the source of the leak. âWe discussed the possibility to buy A.M.I.&#8212;not to kill the story, but to find out the source. They said thatâs not a bad idea. We discussed numbers and the name of the LLC that weâd use. It would be called BOBO LCCâ&#8212;short for Laurenâs helicopter filming company, Black Ops, and Bezosâs space company, Blue Origin&#8212;âthatâs the level of detail we went into.â</p>\n<p>Eventually, according to Michael, they settled on the plan that Michael would fly to New York on January 8 to meet with <em>Enquirer</em> editor <strong>Dylan Howard</strong> and find out what the tabloid planned to publish. But Bezos seemed to have changed his mind and went on the offensive, retaining powerhouse Los Angeles litigator <strong>Marty Singer.</strong> Early on the morning of January 9, before Michael met with Howard, Bezos tweeted out that he was divorcing his wife, <strong>MacKenzie.</strong> âLauren was blindsided by the tweet,â Michael told me.</p>\n<p>Michael blamed de Becker for the strategy shift, which he viewed as a dangerous escalation of the situation, and accused Bezosâs security chief of having selfish motives. The two advisers have been at odds in the press since the <em>Enquirer</em> published its exposÃ©. âLauren calls it a cockfight,â Michael said. The agendas of the opposing camps have produced competing theories as to who is to blame. In his <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">Medium post</a>, Bezos suggested a vast conspiracy involving Trump and Saudi Arabia and the possibility that his communications were hacked to damage him as payback for <em>The Washington Post</em>âs crusading investigation into the murder of <em>Post</em> columnist Jamal Khashoggi.</p>\n<p>But Michael Sanchez said Bezos and de Becker are framing the scandal as a pro-Trump political hit job to distract the public from a far simpler story: Bezos cheated on his wife and de Beckerâs security apparatus couldnât prevent Bezos from being caught. Michael said de Beckerâs judgment is clouded because he has been trying to break Lauren and Bezos up to protect MacKenzie Bezos, a close de Becker friend. De Becker reportedly told Bezos to agree to a 30-day physical separation from Lauren.</p>\n<p>Michael told me that his sister and Bezos continue to speak frequently and that the scandal âbrought them closer together.â Another source close to Lauren confirmed sheâs in contact with Bezos. âThe truth will come out about my motivations and how much I believe in Jeff and Laurenâs love,â Michael Sanchez told me. âItâs a legendary romance that will blow your mind as to just how in love they are. Jeff never blinked about losing $70 billion.â\n<em>This post has been updated.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is Americaâs most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>âs 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, TimothÃ©e Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Jeff Bezos","socialTitle":"âA Legendary Romanceâ: Michael Sanchez Spins His Role in the Bezos Affair","socialDescription":"Weeks ago, Sanchez was a minor player with a semi-famous sister.

If you havenât read it yet, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">go do so</a>. Itâs no literary masterpiece&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/jeff-bezos-mackenzie-divorce-partners-in-ventures\">again</a>, Bezosâs soon-to-be ex-wife, <strong>MacKenzie,</strong> was the writer in the family&#8212;but it is a barn burner, and it works on several levels. It lays out how the <em>National Enquirer</em>âs parent company, American Media Inc., allegedly threatened to unleash intimate photos of the Amazon founder unless his private investigators stop prodding into the tabloidâs methods and, more crucially, he agrees to publicly state that the company was not âpolitically motivatedâ when it exposed his affair with TV host turned helicopter pilot <strong>Lauren Sanchez.</strong> It also invites surprising sympathy for Bezos, a very rich man whose path to wealth and ever-tightening grip on the future of American retail complexify those impulses&#8212;to borrow a term dâart.</p>\n<p>For starters, the public-figure sympathy economy is already in a recession. Expressing the feeling out loud, or in writing or even just thinking it is almost always a mistake, what with people getting <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/milkshake-duck\">milkshake-ducked</a> at an hourly rate. It always comes back to bite you. Person X probably wore blackface at a party in the 80s. He probably touched something he shouldnât have. She probably has patronizing opinions on climate-change policy. Maybe she has bad tweets in the timeline. You thought you were showing your soft side, but it turned out to be your ass.</p>\n<p>And thatâs before we get to Bezos and Amazon, neither of which is exactly unimpeachable. Sure, Bezos has proven to be a decent steward of <em>The Washington Post.</em> But Amazon has its hands in technologies like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/amazon-alexa-conversation-shared-echo.html\">Alexa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/amazon-facial-recognition-orlando-police-department\">police already use its facial recognition technology</a>. The innovations draw criticism for the ways they play fast and loose with private data. Plus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/accidents-at-amazon-workers-left-to-suffer-after-warehouse-injuries\">numerous</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/business/economy/amazon-workers-sears-bankruptcy-filing.html\">reports</a> have alleged poor working conditions in Amazonâs warehouses. (Per <em>The Guardian,</em> âAmazon meanwhile insists that ensuring the safety of its workers is a priority and that it was âproudâ of its record.â)</p>\n<p>Yet, in this particular fight between two powerful, usually unsympathetic entities, one emerges with some pathos, and it has everything to do with dick pics.</p>\n<p>Bezosâs two main foes are <strong>David Pecker,</strong> chairman of A.M.I., and <strong>Dylan Howard,</strong> the companyâs chief content officer, who have something of a track record here. After âcatch and killâ tactics&#8212;wherein a news outlet obtains exclusive rights to a story in order to <em>not</em> publish it&#8212;got <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/nyregion/trump-american-media-michael-cohen.html\">pulled into <strong>federal prosecutorsâ</strong> investigation</a>, A.M.I. signed a non-prosecution agreement that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/publisher-of-the-national-enquirer-admits-to-hush-money-payments-made-on-trumps-behalf/2018/12/12/ebf24b76-fe49-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html?utm_term=.5039d826c06d\">includes</a> both Pecker and Howard.</p>\n<p>Per Bezosâs blog, A.M.I. allegedly threatened to release compromising photographs if Bezos didnât meet its demands. In the e-mails, which Bezos says came from A.M.I., Bezos is asked to state that he has âno knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.âs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.â Bezos believes that the request was motivated by political animus. (<em>The National Enquirer</em> and Trump are, or at least were, pals and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/is-national-enquirer-ami-ready-for-a-war-with-jeff-bezos\">Trump hates <em>The Washington Post</em></a>). Bezos claims to have refused, and tips his hand, alluding to an alleged dinner between an anonymous, Saudi-connected figure, Pecker, and Trump. (A.M.I. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/national-enquirer-publisher-believes-it-acted-lawfully-on-bezos-story-vows-to-investigate-matter.html\">said in a statement</a> that the company âbelieves fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.â)</p>\n<p>Which brings us to the photographic leverage that A.M.I. listed. If you didnât think it could get any worse than <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jeff-bezos-leaked-texts-investigation\">âalive girl,â</a> beware, cursed images described herein:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Mr. Bezos face selfie at what appears to be a business meeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ms. Sanchez responseâ&#8212;âa photograph of her smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A shirtless Mr. Bezos holding his phone in his left handâ&#8212;âwhile wearing his wedding ring. Heâs wearing either tight black cargo pants\nor shortsâ&#8212;âand his semi-erect manhood is penetrating the zipper of\nsaid garment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A full-length body selfie of Mr. Bezos wearing just a pair of tight black boxer-briefs or trunks, with his phone in his left handâ&#8212;âwhile\nwearing his wedding ring.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A selfie of Mr. Bezos fully clothed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A full-length scantily-clad body shot with short trunks.  Â·</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A naked selfie in a bathroomâ&#8212;âwhile wearing his wedding ring. Mr. Bezos is wearing nothing but a white towelâ&#8212;âand the top of his pubic\nregion can be seen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ms. Sanchez wearing a plunging red neckline dress revealing her cleavage and a glimpse of her nether region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ms. Sanchez wearing a two-piece red bikini with gold detail dress revealing her cleavage.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Per one of the e-mails published by Bezos, A.M.I. said releasing these photos now would not be politically motivated; Amazon shareholders deserve to know what its chief has been up to. The texts and pictures are newsworthy in other words, and they have a protected right to publish them. They just needed Bezos to agree publicly that they werenât tailing him for the presidentâs benefit or else.</p>\n<p>Bezos and his lawyers disagree. The story already broke, he writes in a number of words. The pictures would be superfluous, and plus, he owns the dick pics because he took them, and publishing the photos would constitute copyright infringement. Who knows how any of these arguments would each hold up in court, but wow, again Iâm feeling something odd in my gut, something Iâve never felt before. Is it? Could it be? Compassion? For a billionaire?</p>\n<p>Strange to feel sympathy for the richest person in history, isnât it? Itâs not how anyone except, like, Mr. Burns would expect to spend their Thursday night. Weâre much more used to our billionaires being out here <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/26/koch-brothers-americans-for-prosperity-rightwing-political-group\">flooding elections with cash</a> and trying to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-07/stop-demeaning-billionaires-such-as-howard-schultz\">suggest that the word itself</a> is some kind of slur. Bezos, the biggest billionaire, is trying to stave off a blackmailer. Heâs trying to maintain our shared innocence about what âtight black cargo pants or shortsâ could possibly mean. Heâs just trying to keep his modesty from entering the cultural conscious against his will and everyone elseâs will&#8212;everyoneâs will save for that of a man named Pecker.</p>\n<p>I take a little heart in the fact that itâs not a purely sympathetic response for this man, whose personal foibles and professional tactics have been covered at length. Itâs a selfish, projecting kind of sympathy. We canât make money like Bezos makes money, but we can send nudes. Some of us can even send dick pics! We are all vulnerable, our photos and our Internet histories are on the cloud just waiting for some enterprising person to hack us or betray us on a whim. Even the guy who <em>owns</em> cloud storage was not immune. What Iâm saying is that, in a way, his dick pics are <em>our</em> dick pics. Our dick pics are his dick pics.</p>\n<p>Wouldnât it be great, goes the thought experiment, that if we were in Bezosâs position and those photos were in danger of being seen by our grandmothers, we could write a Medium post and have half the Internet cheering us on against this complicated, but certainly nefarious foe? Wouldnât it be great to checkmate the blackmailer, to have gathered certain information about certain dinners with chairmen and certain presidents? Wouldnât it be great to blog on Medium and have people actually read it?</p>\n<p>This sympathy wonât last long, certainly. I give it as long as it takes for Bezos to bury Pecker, and not a day more.

capabilities. âHe doesn&#39;t get distracted easily,â gushes one analyst.","body":"<p>The past few weeks have been pretty tough on billionaire <strong>Jeff Bezos,</strong> at least relative to his usual circumstances, and not those of, say, people who work in coal mines or <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/worse_than_wal_mart_amazons_sick_brutality_and_secret_history_of_ruthlessly_intimidating_workers/\">Amazon</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-share-their-horror-stories-2018-4\">warehouses</a>. In January, he and his wife of 25 years, <strong>MacKenzie Bezos,</strong> announced they were splitting up, in what could be the most expensive divorce in human history. Shortly thereafter, <em>The National Enquirer</em> published a story revealing his affair with <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> and the sexts that went with it. Then, earlier this month, <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> tabloid of choice allegedly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">tried to blackmail the tech founder</a>, threatening to publish, among other things, a âbelow the belt selfieâ&#8212;âotherwise colloquially known as a âd--k pick [sic],â unless Bezos agreed to drop his investigation into how his private correspondence ended up in the <em>Enquirer</em>âs hands.</p>\n<p>Normally, if the C.E.O. of a public company was caught in a scandal involving photos of his genitalia, the board would be under intense pressure by shareholders to say <em>you gotta go,</em> with Wall Street analysts writing concerned notes to clients about said C.E.O.âs ability to focus in the midst of thousands of stories being written about his penis. Luckily for Bezos, that hasnât happened, because 1) heâs the chairman of Amazonâs board, and 2) Wall Street apparently believes he has the unique ability to juggle running multiple businesses and nude-selfie drama all at once.</p>\n<p>âBezos is an individual who has the capacity to work on multiple fronts at the same time. He doesnât get distracted easily,â gushed <strong>Tom Forte,</strong> an analyst at D.A. Davidson who sees the Amazonâs stock price rising to $2,450 a share, in comments to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/investing/amazon-stock/index.html\">CNN</a>. âLook at his ability to concurrently advance Amazon, own <em>The Washington Post,</em> and develop Blue Origin from scratch. That has in no way detracted from his ability to run Amazon.â <strong>Norm Conley,</strong> C.E.O. of JAG Capital Management, agreed, saying he would not be selling his shares. Bezos, he added, is âa genius.â While conceding that âfrom a public-relations standpoint,â the whole thing is not âideal,â <strong>Anthony DiClemente,</strong> senior managing director at Evercore ISI, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/amazon-analysts-shrug-off-bezos-enquirer-saga-see-no-impact-on-the-stock.html\">told</a> CNBC, âI donât think the allegations have a direct line into the fundamentals of Amazon.â <strong>Ron Josey,</strong> an Internet analyst at JMP Securities, concurred, saying he âwould be surprised if it had a negative impact on Amazon.â (Amazonâs stock has fallen approximately 5 percent since the day before Bezos announced his intent to divorce, though, per CNBC, the reason for the decline âis likely the companyâs warning during the earnings call last week of increased spending and slowing growth in 2019.â)</p>\n<p>Of course, strong fundamentals and a penchant for multi-tasking likely arenât the only reasons analysts are sticking with Bezos. Their resilience probably also has something to do with the fact that, in taking the story into his own hands, Bezos is standing up to a âjournalisticâ enterprise that ranks several notches below the parasites that feed on pond scum&#8212;and, by proxy, its biggest presidential fan.</p>\n<p>âBezos is that extraordinary, and Amazon is that extraordinary, that he can bring down a bully,â <strong>Davia Temin,</strong> founder of crisis-management firm Temin and Co, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/jeff-bezos-extortion-and-embarrassing-pics-won-t-distract-me\">told</a> Bloomberg. âHeâs got the courage, and the position as the richest man in the United States, and I think his courage in standing up to the extortion is going to outweigh the details behind the extortion.â Is he still the founder of a company known for decimating competitors and grinding workers into the dirt? Sure! Would the tabloid fracas in which he is currently embroiled have taken down any other, equally horny exec? Probably! But with Bezos, the dick-pic moxie is strong.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Report: rich people on high alert for dick-pic leaks in wake Bezos scandal</strong></p>\n<p>Bezos may have the support of shareholders and a level of wealth at which he is, as Bloombergâs <strong>Matt Levine</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-08/you-have-to-know-whose-data-you-re-using\">put it</a>, âtoo rich to be embarrassed,â but not everyone enjoys those comforts. And presumably, those who donât are <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/02/08/bezos-selfie-leak-triggers-an-alarm-for-billionaires-everywhere/?xid=gn_editorspicks\">planning accordingly right about now</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Jeff Bezos alleged in a blog post Thursday that he was the victim of blackmail attempts by the publisher of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> it probably sent chills down the spines of billionaires everywhere. . . . Ask any family office about its biggest fears and cyber-security is near the top. Personal protection no longer involves just bodyguards and a top-notch alarm system. The Internet Age has seen a massive shift in people storing their most sensitive and personal data online, where itâs vulnerable to hacking and intrusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âThe perception among very affluent people is often, âI have this level of wealth, Iâm untouchable,ââ <strong>Mark Johnson,</strong> chief executive officer of Sovereign Intelligence, told Bloomberg. âBut the systems they have in place for protecting their personal identifiable information are very weak.â On the bright side, this whole Bezos situation will presumably result in a jobs boom for security experts who can keep, for instance, <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> or <strong>Bill Gatesâs</strong> nudes on lockdown.</p>\n<p><strong>Jared Kushner is going on a road trip</strong></p>\n<p>Itâs through the Middle East to promote his âpeace plan,â and apparently includes a pit stop at a special friendâs:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1093718582159163392\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1093718582159163392\">https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1093718582159163392</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Kushner, as you may recall, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia\">is tight</a> with Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> who U.S. intelligence agencies say ordered the killing of journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. That friendship came in handy when Donald Trump effectively <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/unusual-statement-disputing-cia-filled-exclamation-points-trump-backs-saudi-n938526\">decided to let the kingdom get away with murder</a> and is apparently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/white-house-khashoggi-deadline/index.html\">still going strong</a> despite a rather damning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman.html\">new report</a> from <em>The New York Times</em> detailing audio of a conversation in which bin Salman reportedly said he would go after Khashoggi âwith a bullet.â</p>\n<p><strong>Steve Cohen begging someone to take Midtown duplex off his hands</strong></p>\n<p>In fact, heâs <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/steve-cohen-has-cut-price-of-nyc-apartment-60-to-45-million\">practically giving it away at this point</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The billionaire has dropped the price of his Midtown Manhattan duplex more than six times in six years and is now asking $45 million for the apartment&#8212;a $70 million discount to the $115 million he originally listed it for in April 2013.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cohen, the founder of Point72 Asset Management, bought the five-bedroom unit in One Beacon Court between 58th and 59th Streets for $24 million in 2005.

All of them said that they worked for Trump without legal status&#8212;and that their managers knew. . . . In Bound Brook, a majority-Hispanic town where many of the areaâs blue-collar workers live, the presence of illegal workers on Trumpâs staff was widely known, according to people in the community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âIt was far more systematic than two or three housekeepers,â said <strong>Joyce Phipps,</strong> executive director of Casa de Esperanza, a legal-aid organization for immigrants, who said she has had several clients who were Bedminster employees. âItâs been a very open secret.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a statement, the Trump Organization told the <em>Post:</em> âWe have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices.

Members of Congress? Federal employees? Or, for that matter, any political donors? There is no end in sight for those whose tax information may be in jeopardy.â Of course, there is an end in sight, and itâs in the White House, whose inhabitantâs tax returns are the only ones Democrats are interested in seeing, on account of that whole <em>New York Times</em> investigation accusing Trump of âoutrightâ tax fraud, among other things.

That Bezos, the richest man in the world, would put resources into determining how his sexts with <strong>Lauren Sanchez</strong> found their way into the worldâs sleaziest tabloid was not entirely surprising, and is probably what anyone else in his position would to do, too. That he would publish <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">a lengthy post on Medium</a> revealing the <em>Enquirer</em>âs attempts to seemingly extort him if he didnât drop the investigation was a bit more unexpected!</p>\n<p>According to Bezosâs post, his legal and investigatory team was approached by American Media Inc., publisher of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> with a demand to halt their investigation and tell the press they had âno knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.âs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.â And if Bezos refused?

I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.â</p>\n<p>A.M.I. is currently embroiled in a legal controversy involving publisher <strong>David Peckerâs</strong> friendship with <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and the <em>Enquirer</em>âs alleged practice of âcatch and kill,â or purposefully buying and burying incriminating stories. In August, Pecker cut an immunity deal with federal prosecutors who are probing an incident in which Trumpâs former attorney, <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> negotiated a hush-money payment with A.M.I. to bury allegations by former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> that she had an affair with Trump. (Trump has denied the claim.) Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign-finance violations related to his role in facilitating payments to McDougal and to porn actress <strong>Stormy Daniels.</strong></p>\n<p>In a statement, A.M.I. said: âAmerican Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.   Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.  Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.  Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.â</p>","rubric":"Blackmail","socialTitle":"Jeff Bezos Accuses National Enquirer of âD*ck Pickâ

takes on David Pecker, Trumpâs favorite tabloid may have finally met its match.","body":"<p>American Media Inc., the parent company of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> is under heavy scrutiny following <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">explosive allegations</a> that it attempted to blackmail Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>&#8212;and, according to a former <em>Enquirer</em> editor, the tabloid may be in over its head. âI think they thought they were smarter than they are,â <strong>Jerry George,</strong> the tabloidâs former Los Angeles bureau chief, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/donlemoncnn/videos/848877438777334/\">told</a> CNN Thursday night. âAnd I think now the reality is hitting them and theyâre freaking out.â</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">blog post</a> published Thursday evening, Bezos claimed that A.M.I., whose <em>Enquirer</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-alleged-relationship\">reported</a> on his affair with television anchor <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> attempted to stop his investigation into how the tabloid had obtained his sensitive text messages by threatening to release intimate photos of the Amazon chief and <em>Washington Post</em> publisher. The apparent threat, as George noted, could open A.M.I. up to legal vulnerability&#8212;and comes after the company, whose C.E.O., <strong>David Pecker,</strong> is a close ally of <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> is still dealing with the fallout from its alleged role in quashing stories of women who claimed to have had affairs with the then-candidate.</p>\n<p>In 2016, the company purchased the story of <strong>Karen McDougal,</strong> a former Playboy model who claimed sheâd had an affair with Trump, with no intention of running it. The âcatch and killâ deal was arranged by <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/cohens-guilty-plea-came-together-very-fast\">pleaded guilty</a> to campaign-finance violations last year related to his efforts to silence McDougal and porn actress <strong>Stormy Daniels.</strong> (Trump has repeatedly denied both affairs.) A.M.I. avoided prosecution as part of the scandal by <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-national-enquirer-allies-defect-david-pecker-michael-cohen\">agreeing</a> to cooperate with investigators&#8212;a move that, per my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-national-enquirer-allies-defect-david-pecker-michael-cohen\">stunned</a> Trumpâs allies&#8212;âHoly shit,â a Trump friend told Sherman, âI thought Pecker would be the last one to turn.â (Pecker did not respond to Shermanâs request for comment.)</p>\n<p>But the apparent effort to blackmail Bezos&#8212;who has been repeatedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1084627451983073280\">bashed by Trump</a> due to his ownership of the <em>Post</em>&#8212;suggests the companyâs shady behavior has continued. After Bezos revealed the alleged extortion effort, journalist <strong>Ronan Farrow,</strong> who famously <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal\">reported</a> on A.M.I.âs role in the McDougal saga for <em>The New Yorker,</em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonanFarrow/status/1093690150448758784\">tweeted</a> that he, too, had been the subject of a potential blackmail campaign by the company, in an effort to quash an investigation. He also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonanFarrow/status/1093734749821194241\">wrote</a> that, according to his previous reporting, <strong>Dylan Howard,</strong> the <em>Enquirer</em> editor who attempted to turn up the heat on Bezos, is a close ally of <strong>Harvey Weinsteinâs</strong> and spearheaded a âsecret collaboration with . . . Weinstein to dig up dirt on accusers.â (In a lengthy statement to Farrow, Howard <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies\">maintained</a> that his relationship with Weinstein was professional and aboveboard; a spokesperson for Weinstein told Farrow that Howard âserved as the point person for American Mediaâs long-standing business relationship with The Weinstein Company.â) He added, âI did not engage as I donât cut deals with subjects of ongoing reporting.â</p>\n<p>On CNN, George theorized that the <em>Enquirer</em>âs efforts were connected to the president: âFor years, Donald Trump has had a hard-on for Bezos,â he said. âProfessional jealousy, the acquisition of Amazon . . . so itâs no surprise that he turned to his good buddy David Pecker . . . to do a hatchet job on him.â And yet itâs not clear whether the tabloid acted on Trumpâs behalf&#8212;back in August, a source close to A.M.I. told Sherman that he and Pecker hadnât spoken in months, and that Howard was âparticularly angryâ at the president, and felt âused and abused by himâ after the feds subpoenaed his employer. (Howard did not respond to Shermanâs request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Itâs equally unclear whether A.M.I.âs alleged threat constitutes a crime. The company has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/national-enquirer-publisher-believes-it-acted-lawfully-on-bezos-story-vows-to-investigate-matter.html\">maintained</a> it acted lawfully, and said that at the time of Bezosâs allegations, it was in âgood faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.â But when the question was posed to him, <em>New Yorker</em> legal expert <strong>Jeffrey Toobin</strong> <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-feb-07-2019?e=189f30aee3\">replied</a>, âI donât know.â Itâs a question that will be of particular concern to the publication in the coming days, especially considering Bezosâs allusion to others who have contacted his investigation team about âsimilar experiences with A.M.I.â A source familiar with the <em>Enquirer</em> <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-feb-07-2019?e=189f30aee3\">told</a> CNNâs <strong>Brian Stelter</strong> there are indeed other such stories, predicting ominously: âIt will all come out now.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

York governor is asking Jeff Bezos to give Queens another chance as the location for Amazonâs HQ2.","body":"<p>Last month, <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> hit <strong>Andrew Cuomo</strong> with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-amazon-headquarters-long-island-city\">Valentineâs Day stunner</a>: after all the hype, Bezos told the New York governor that he would not, in fact, build a second Amazon headquarters in Queens. âWhile polls show that 70 percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment,â read a statement from the company, âa number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City.â</p>\n<p>But like many jilted suitors before him, Cuomo is asking for a second chance. In a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/641-read-the-open-letter-to-amazon/0a112e77301026beb86d/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">full-page ad</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> on Friday, Cuomo, Mayor <strong>Bill de Blasio,</strong> and other New York leaders called on Bezos to reconsider, writing in an open letter that the governor will âtake personal responsibility for the projectâs state approval,â while the mayor will âwork together with the governor to manage the community development process.â</p>\n<p>âNew York attracts the best, most diverse talent from across the globe,â read Fridayâs letter, which was signed by business and union leaders and politicians, including Democratic Representative <strong>Hakeem Jeffries.</strong> âWe all hope you reconsider and join us in building the exciting future of New York.â</p>\n<p>Cuomo has also launched a behind-the-scenes effort to win Amazon back. Per the <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/nyregion/amazon-hq2-nyc.html\">Times</a>,</em> he has personally spoken with Bezos several times in recent weeks. People familiar with the calls told the paper he has sought to salvage the deal, and volunteered to help Amazon navigate New Yorkâs governmental process. According to one person familiar with the calls, Cuomo has reiterated his assertion that Amazon should have âstayed and fought the oppositionâ&#8212;something heâs said publicly since the deal collapsed.</p>\n<p>Itâs not clear if his overtures are resonating with Bezos, who the governor admits has given no indication that thereâs been âany changes.â Opposition to the Amazon deal remains fierce, with those on the left objecting to the tax-subsidies leaders used to seduce Bezos, and the gentrification the plan could accelerate. âAmazon is a billion-dollar company,â Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1062204614496403457\">tweeted</a> in November. âThe idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.â</p>\n<p>âDisplacement is not community development,â she added. âShuffling working class people out of a community does not improve their quality of life.â</p>\n<p>Still, Cuomo and his fellow HQ2 supporters seem committed to keep trying. âNew Yorkers do not want to give up on the 25,000 permanent jobs, 11,000 union construction and maintenance jobs, and $28 billion in new tax revenues that Amazon was prepared to bring to our state,â the open letter Friday read. âA clear majority of New Yorkers support this project and were disappointed by your decision not to proceed.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity

wonder why getting Bezos to back off was so important.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In mid-January, when <em>The National Enquirer</em> <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-text-messages-affair-scandal/\">published</a> its epic exposÃ© revealing <strong>Jeff Bezosâs</strong> months-long extramarital dalliance, it was one of those once-every-so-often moments of mainstream credibility for the notorious supermarket tabloid. Bezos, after all, is the richest man in the world and the founder of a trillion-dollar company that has revolutionized the way we live, shop, and consume media. Some of the <em>Enquirer</em>âs language and packaging (steamy text messages and surreptitious dinner-date photos) was typically tawdry&#8212;but the fact that Bezos was having an affair and divorcing his wife of 25 years was major news no matter how you sliced it. The <em>Enquirer,</em> it seemed, had landed the scoop fair and square. Serious journalists were paying attention to the story, and talking about what it meant for Amazon, for Bezosâs reputation, and, of course, for the <em>Enquirer.</em></p>\n<p>For much of the previous year, the publication had been mired in a legal and public-relations crisis of its own making, thanks to its apparent role in muzzling women who alleged theyâd had affairs with President <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> a longtime pal of <strong>David Pecker,</strong> who is chairman and C.E.O. of the <em>Enquirer</em>âs parent company, American Media Inc. Now, in the wake of that ignominy, here was a massive newsbreak that put the <em>Enquirer</em> at the center of the news cycle in precisely the way it wanted to be. This was just what the tabloid needed given its recent history of dwindling circulation and staggering political scandal. It was proof that the <em>Enquirer</em> could still shine light on the misbehavior of the powerful, just as it had when it brought down <strong>John Edwards</strong> in 2007 through an <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/john-edwards-love-child-scandal/\">exhaustive investigation</a> into the cover-up of the onetime presidential hopefulâs love child. It looked like a victory lap following a series of black eyes.</p>\n<p>A month later, to the <em>Enquirer</em>âs consternation, that script has been turned on its head, thanks to Bezosâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bezos-wins-praise-for-his-essay-in-the-wapo-newsroom\">âballsyâ publication</a> of e-mails that appeared to show A.M.I. attempting to blackmail him with the threat of exposing a dick pic and other embarrassing photos. âIn the A.M.I. letters Iâm making public,â Bezos wrote in his <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">extraordinary post</a> on the Web site Medium, âyou will see the precise details of their extortionate proposal: they will publish the personal photos unless [security consultant] <strong>Gavin de Becker</strong> and I make the specific false public statement to the press that we âhave no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.âs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.â If we do not agree to affirmatively publicize that specific lie, they say theyâll publish the photos, and quickly.â</p>\n<p>The <em>Enquirer</em> now finds itself somewhere itâs not used to being: on the defensive. Itâs gone from trying to strong-arm Bezos into calling off the dogs investigating how the <em>Enquirer</em> came to possess his private texts, to becoming the subject of an investigation by the board of its own parent company, which said last week that it âwill take whatever appropriate action is necessary.â (The board has retained an outside firm to conduct the probe, according to someone familiar with the matter.) Worse for Pecker, the feds are now re-examining the immunity deal they struck with him last year, over the <em>Enquirer</em>âs involvement with former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> in paying off women who claimed to have slept with the president. There are signs, meanwhile, that do seem to point to a potentially politically motivated source. (Bezos owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> whose coverage Trump and his allies are no fans of.) The Daily Beast <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7\">reported yesterday</a> that its own sources say the <em>Enquirer</em> got the texts from <strong>Michael Sanchez,</strong> the brother of Bezosâs mistress, who moves in Trumpworld circles. (Sanchez declined to comment to the Beast.) During an interview with ABCâs <strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong> on Sunday, Peckerâs attorney, <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> described the leaker only as âa reliable source that had given information to <em>The National Enquirer</em> for seven years prior to this story. It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.â Abramowitz also insisted that A.M.I. had acted legally in all of its interactions with the Bezos camp. (A.M.I. declined to comment for this story.)</p>\n<p>Even by <em>National Enquirer</em> standards, the whole episode has stunned battle-hardened tabloid veterans who thought theyâd seen it all. âThe history of tabloid journalism is rife with all sorts of behind-the-scenes deals,â said <strong>George Rush,</strong> the former <em>Daily News</em> gossip columnist. âBut to put that offer so bluntly and brazenly, to a man who has the intelligence and power to impale you on your own sword, was stupid.â</p>\n<p>âIâm as mystified as everybody else,â said <strong>Larry Hackett,</strong> the former longtime editor of <em>People</em> magazine. âIn light of everything theyâre facing, to be operating so close to the edge? Iâm not a lawyer, but to put on paper this kind of threat to the richest guy in the world who, also, by the way, owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> it just seems unusual. I think the story today is: why were they so determined and hell-bent to get Bezos to say itâs not political? Here is what the <em>Enquirer</em> is betraying that they donât normally betray: fear. The fact that they were so adamant to get Bezos to say that this wasnât political suggests a worry on their part, and nothing weâve seen in the past few days is gonna make that go away.â</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In the media world, the <em>Enquirer</em> has spent the past few decades teetering on and off the brink of legitimacy. Under the stewardship of Harvard-educated editor-in-chief <strong>Steve Coz</strong> in the 1990s, it won acclaim for its dogged <strong>O.J. Simpson</strong> coverage. Similarly, the late-aughts <strong>David Perel</strong> era gave us the <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> cheating scandal and the Edwards affair, which put the <em>Enquirer</em> in the previously unheard of territory of Pulitzer Prize contention. The decades-old scandal sheet was getting favorable coverage from the likes of <em>The New York Times, The Washington Post, GQ</em> and <em>Playboy.</em> But as with all print media, market forces were beginning to work against it. Circulation was on the decline&#8212;it is now reportedly south of 300,000, down from a peak of around 6 million a week in the late 1970s&#8212;and A.M.I. was running into financing troubles that it continues to grapple with today.</p>\n<p>In early 2014, just before current editor-in-chief <strong>Dylan Howard</strong> took over, the <em>Enquirer</em> made waves for an embarrassing episode in which it got conned into running an interview with a prankster pretending to be <strong>David Bar Katz,</strong> a playwright and close friend of Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had just died of a heroin overdose. The fake Katz claimed in the article that he and Hoffman were cocaine-guzzling lovers, which indeed would have been a sizzling <em>Enquirer</em> scoop were it true. There was a correction and a libel settlement, and then-editor <strong>Tony Frost</strong> was ousted shortly after.</p>\n<p>The Howard era began with a much-needed redesign, a merry band of talented new recruits from the tabloid and celebrity-journalism world, a closer relationship with digital sister publication Radar Online, and the promise of returning the <em>Enquirer</em> to its roots of fearless shoe-leather sleuthing and rigid fact-checks, combined with unabashed checkbook journalism. Howard, after all, had bombshells like <strong>Mel Gibsonâs</strong> racist rants and <strong>Charlie Sheenâs</strong> drug test under his belt. âIt couldnât have come at a better time,â executive editor <strong>Barry Levine,</strong> who no longer works at the <em>Enquirer,</em> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2014/07/the-enquirer-exposed-002583\">told me back then</a>. âWe needed a real jolt, something to freshen us up.â</p>\n<p>Trumpâs rise as a serious presidential contender in 2015 changed the equation, at least as far as public perception was concerned. The <em>Enquirer,</em> thanks to Trumpâs well-known affiliation with Pecker, came under scrutiny for doing kid-gloves coverage of the candidate, while at the same time unleashing a fusillade of stories suggesting that <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/10/in-the-enquirer-primary-clintons-campaign-is-dead-literally-214693\">virtually on the brink of death</a>. Even that behavior, though, would pale in comparison to Peckerâs admission last year that his <em>Enquirer</em> had acquired the rights to a <em>Playboy</em> modelâs story of having an affair with Trump, only to bury the story in order to help Trump ahead of the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York revealed they had agreed not to prosecute American Media Inc. in return for Peckerâs cooperation, and the deal stipulated that going forward, A.M.I. âshall commit no crimes whatsoever.â</p>\n<p>The e-mails that Bezos published last week would appear to suggest that A.M.I. may have already broken that promise. They also appeared to quash any notion that the <em>Enquirer</em> might start cleaning up its act. âI think the story of the worldâs richest man getting divorced is a good story. Thereâs no doubt about that,â said <strong>Martin Dunn,</strong> a former <em>Daily News</em> editor-in-chief who also worked at the notorious British tabloids <em>News of the World</em> and <em>The Sun</em> (and also wrote for the <em>Enquirer</em> under Generoso Pope Jr. in the late 1970s). âBut the subsequent interchange between the paper and Bezos is something Iâve never seen before. I have seen many scandals in newspapers in my time, but Iâve never seen a situation where people have been told thereâs a quid pro quo like that for stuff being run. That, to me, set a new low bar for tabloid behavior.â</p>\n<p>I asked Dunn how much damage he thinks the Bezos standoff could inflict on the <em>Enquirer</em> long-term. âLook, at the end of the day, it is a shadow of its former self,â he said. âThis was a sensational story, and it increased their profile for a short moment, but now it seems to have increased their profile for all the wrong reasons.â</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"âA New Low Barâ: Tabloid Vets Say Blackmailing Bezos Was Inexplicably Stupid","socialDescription":"No one expects the Enquirer to

and 2) <em>The National Enquirer</em> tried to blackmail him over them, Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> dropped another bomb on Thursday: his company will <em>not</em> open a second headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, because certain people were real jerks about the more than $3 billion in taxpayer subsidies Amazon was slated to receive.</p>\n<p>In a statement <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html\">announcing</a> that it would be canceling its plans for a new corporate campus in N.Y.C., Amazon wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After much thought and deliberation, weâve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City, Queens. For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term. While polls show that 70% of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion&#8212;we love New York, its incomparable dynamism, people, and culture&#8212;and particularly the community of Long Island City, where we have gotten to know so many optimistic, forward-leaning community leaders, small-business owners, and residents. There are currently over 5,000 Amazon employees in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Staten Island, and we plan to continue growing these teams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The original deal was met with harsh blowback immediately after it was announced, on account of the fact that, despite the pledge to create new jobs, many people didnât think the richest company in the world, run by the richest man in the world, needed billions in incentives to move to a city where fellow tech giants like Google have <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/google-to-invest-usd1-billion-in-nyc-no-tax-incentives-needed.html\">come for free</a>. (That Amazon has said it will continue growing its teams in the other boroughs, sans subsidies, suggests it didnât.) On Twitter, Representative <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1062204614496403457\">wrote</a>: âThe idea that [Amazon] will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.â Last week, State Senator <strong>Michael Gianaris,</strong> a major critic of the deal, was appointed to a state board that had the power to veto the whole thing, at which point Amazon <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/facing-opposition-amazon-reconsiders-ny-headquarters-site-two-officials-say/2019/02/08/451ffc52-2a19-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html\">reportedly</a> began to reconsider the move.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Gianaris basically told Amazon: <em>donât let the door hit you on the way out.</em> âLike a petulant child, Amazon insists on getting its way or takes its ball and leaves,â Gianaris told <em>The New York Times.</em> âEven by their own words, Amazon admits they will grow their presence in New York without their promised subsidies. So what was all this really about?â In addition to the subsidies, other perks of the deal that didnât go over super well with the public included a plan to move a distribution center for school lunches and give Bezos access to a helicopter pad.</p>\n<p>Among those for whom the announcement will 100 percent ruin Valentineâs Day? New York Governor <strong>Andrew Cuomo,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-governor-jokes-amazon-cuomo-name-change-hq2-2018-11\">said</a> last year he would change his name to Amazon Cuomo âif thatâs what it takes,â and in recent days <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/new-york-governor-cuomo-says-the-state-needs-amazon.html\">went after politicians</a> opposing the plan, calling their resistance âirresponsibleâ and âgovernmental malpractice.â Also: everyone who rushed to buy a place in Queens on the original news. âThis is like a gift from the gods for the Long Island City condo market,â <strong>Patrick W. Smith,</strong> a real-estate agent in the area, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-move-to-long-island-city-sparks-condo-frenzy-1542116117\">told</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> at the time. âWhat happened today is a real tragedy,â <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-14/long-island-city-brokers-despair-over-amazon-s-abrupt-reversal\">said</a> <strong>Jason Haber</strong>, a broker with Warburg Realty Partnership Ltd, on the anniversary of an actual, <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/one-year-later-florida-students-join-together-to-remem-1832629945\">non-real estate tragedy</a>.

So, just a quick update: what he meant to say was that victims of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/14/18222167/trump-border-security-deal\">natural disasters will pay for it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> said Thursday that Trump agreed to sign a package of seven spending bills that will fund nine federal departments including Transportation, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, narrowly averting another government shutdown. The president will also declare a national emergency at the same time, McConnell said. . . . By declaring a national emergency, Trump will be able to tap into funds otherwise dedicated to disaster relief or military construction projects, and redirect them to border wall construction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To recap, Trump demanded money for his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/upshot/trump-border-wall-polls.html\">deeply unpopular</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/border-wall-impractical-expensive-ineffective-plan\">completely pointless</a> border wall for more than two years, was denied at every turn, shut down the government, still didnât get what he wanted, and has now decided, <em>screw it, Iâll just take the money.</em> Itâs the sort of thinking that you would expect from guy whose father <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\">funded</a> one epic disaster after another, though <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-national-emergency-border.html\">not everyone is going for it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> of California said Democrats were âreviewing our optionsâ in responding to Mr. Trumpâs anticipated declaration and did not rule out a legal challenge. âThe president is doing an end run around Congress,â she said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She also raised the possibility that Mr. Trump was setting a precedent for Democratic presidents to come, precisely what Republicans fear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âYou want to talk about a national emergency, letâs talk about today,â Ms. Pelosi said, reminding Mr. Trump that it was the first anniversary of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. âThatâs a national emergency. Why donât you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-08/trump-can-t-declare-national-emergency-to-build-border-wall\">noted</a> last month, âany attempt by Trump to get around Congress by using invented emergency powers would violate the Constitutionâ and would âalmost certainly would be blocked by the courts,â not to mention âconstitute a high crime and misdemeanor qualifying him for impeachment.â On the other hand, staying on the right side of the law has never been of particular importance to this president. And he wants his wall, god damn it! Heâs a builder! He builds things! Just give him the money, and no one gets hurt!</p>\n<p><strong>Youâll never believe it, but Trumpâs E.P.A. might have subverted science</strong></p>\n<p>After its takes on methane in the atmosphere (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/trumps-insane-new-energy-policy-would-put-global-warming-on-steroids\">good</a>), fossil fuels (<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-team-advocates-burning-fossil-fuels-even-u-s-scientists-n946826\">good</a>), and asbestos (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-asbestos\">very very good</a>), this report <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/epas-top-leaders-stymied-research-unit-report-finds-11550149201\">may or may not come as a shock</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Environmental Protection Agency research unit tasked with evaluating chemicalsâ health risks has had its work hindered by the agencyâs top leadership, according to a government watchdog. The unit, known as the Integrated Risk Information System, or IRIS, is responsible for identifying dangers from chemicals in products such as paint and pesticides, and releasing assessments of their potential threats to human health.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A draft Government Accountability Office report found that âthe IRIS program has been unable to release any work since June 2018 while it was waiting for feedback from the Administratorâs office,â according to a copy reviewed by <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> The G.A.O. is a nonpartisan federal auditing agency that provides information to Congress. âIRIS program progress toward producing assessments was delayed by EPA leadership deliberations about priorities,â the draft said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The findings reflect a fundamental shift in thinking at agencies like the E.P.A., where Trump administration officials are challenging longtime practices, particularly around the use of science, said <strong>Bernard Goldstein,</strong> a professor emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health who oversaw EPA scientific programs under President Reagan. âTheyâve had these standard approaches, and now the standard approaches are gone,â said Mr. Goldstein, adding that he found this development troubling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a statement, E.P.A. spokesman <strong>James Hewitt</strong> claimed Trump-appointed officials at the agency <em>love</em> science, just not the commie kind used under Obama that prioritized protecting human health and the environment. âThe Trump EPA believes it is using the best available science to determine its proposed rules and regulations, just as the former administration believed it was doing the same thing,â Hewitt told the <em>Journal.</em> âHowever, this administration clearly has huge disagreements with the way the Obama administration carried out the agencyâs mission.â</p>\n<p><strong>But what about the ethics pledge?!</strong></p>\n<p>Hereâs another update you might want to sit down for: it turns out Trump wasnât actually serious about draining the swamp, unless when he said âdrain the swampâ he actually meant âre-populate it with officials from my own administration,â which he might have! Sometimes these things get lost in translation. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-lobbying-swamp-is-flourishing-in-trumps-washington\">Per ProPublica</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In his first 10 days in office, Trump signed an executive order that required all his political hires to sign a pledge. On its face, itâs straightforward and ironclad: When Trump officials leave government employment, they agree not to lobby the agencies they worked in for five years. They also canât lobby anyone in the White House or political appointees across federal agencies for the duration of the Trump administration. And they canât perform âlobbying activities,â or things that would help other lobbyists, including setting up meetings or providing background research. Violating the pledge exposes former officials to fines and extended or even permanent bans on lobbying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But loopholes, some of them sizable, abound. At least 33 former Trump officials have found ways around the pledge. The most prominent is former Interior Secretary <strong>Ryan Zinke,</strong> who resigned in December after a series of ethics investigations. He announced Wednesday that he is joining a lobbying firm, Turnberry Solutions, which was started in 2017 by several former Trump campaign aides. Asked whether Zinke will register as a lobbyist, Turnberry partner Jason Osborne said, âHe will if he has a client that he wants to lobby for.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ex-lobbyists, of course, also play a major role in the Trump administration, with one of the most prominent being acting E.P.A. administrator <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> who had a bright career as a coal lobbyist before joining Team Trump. According to ProPublica, âat least 230 former and current registered lobbyists have worked in the Trump administration.â</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>New Jersey Governor Says New

scandal.","promoDek":"Lauren Sanchezâs Trump-loving brother is said to be âground zeroâ of the <em>Enquirer</em> scandal.","body":"<p><em>The National Enquirer</em>âs 12-page spread detailing <strong>Jeff Bezosâs</strong> affair with <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> which included private text messages between the two, inspired an obvious yet burning question: who leaked the sexts, and why? Now, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7\">a new report</a> from the Daily Beast has seemingly provided an answer: according to multiple sources inside <em>Enquirer</em> parent company A.M.I., the culprit is Sanchezâs Trump-loving brother, <strong>Michael Sanchez.</strong></p>\n<p>The apparent confirmation comes just days after Bezosâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">blog post</a> alleging A.M.I. had attempted to extort him, demanding he drop his investigation into how the <em>Enquirer</em> obtained his texts, and publish a statement denying that the tabloidâs motivations were political, or suffer the consequences (the consequences, in this case, being the release of at least one âd--k pickâ). How Michael allegedly obtained the messages between his sister and the Amazon founder is still unclear, and as of late January, he <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a26256501/michael-sanchez-lauren-brother-jeff-bezos-national-enquirer/\">denied</a> having anything to do with the leak. But according to reporter <strong>Lachlan Markay</strong> his motivations sure <em>sound</em> politically motivated!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Documents reviewed by the Daily Beast show that Michael Sanchez believed the <em>Enquirer</em> pursued its story about Bezos with âPresident Trumpâs knowledge and appreciationâ&#8212;a chase encouraged, in Sanchezâs estimation, by Republican operatives âwho THINK Jeff gets up every morning and has a [<em>Washington Post</em>] meeting to plot its next diabolical attack on President Trump.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He certainly was a reliable and public supporter of the president. âFor anyone too stupid or too bitter to admit Muellerâs pack of @POTUS-hating@TheDemocrats is leading an out-of-control witch hunt, read about @jerome_corsi,â Sanchez wrote in a more-or-less typical tweet. âMuellerism = McCarthyism.â According to <em>The Washington Post,</em> Sanchez said he had heard from A.M.I. staffers that the tabloid operation was in the middle of âa takedown to make Trump happy.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an interview with ABC on Sunday, <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> a lawyer for A.M.I., told <strong>George Stephanopoulos,</strong> âThe story was given to <em>The National Enquirer</em> by a reliable source that had given information to <em>The National Enquirer</em> for seven years prior to this story. It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.â Sources familiar with Bezosâs personal investigation, headed up by security consultant <strong>Gavin de Becker,</strong> told the Beast that âThere is no one inside this inquiry process who doesnât believe [Sanchez is] ground zero.â (de Becker reportedly interviewed Sanchez as part of his probe.)</p>\n<p>Of particular interest are Michael Sanchezâs alleged ties to <strong>Roger Stone</strong> and <strong>Carter Page,</strong> both key Trumpworld figures. (Stone is, of course, a former advisor to the Trump campaign who was indicted by the special prosecutor in January. Page was foreign policy adviser to the campaign who has also piqued the interest of <strong>Robert Mueller</strong>.) According to the Daily Beast, de Becker questioned Sanchez about his communications with both men, as well as with <strong>Scottie Nell Hughes,</strong> a pro-Trump commentator who now works for the Russian state television network RT. Stone, who was reportedly in contact with Sanchez in the days after the <em>Enquirer</em> story was published, told the Daily Beast that he has never hacked anyone and said that Michael Sanchez is a âvery good guy.â</p>\n<p>If Sanchez is indeed the leaker, many questions still remain to this dick-pic mystery: Why would he betray his sister? Do his ties to people in Trumpâs orbit come into play? And what, if anything, is the âSaudi connectionâ? (In his Medium post, Bezos noted that A.M.I. has âbeen investigated for various actions theyâve taken on behalf of the Saudi Government,â and noted that the suggestion the <em>Enquirer</em> might be tangled up with the Saudis seemed âto hit a particularly sensitive nerve.â)</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting

","familyName":"Bush","bio":"âMore impressive than the paintingâs aesthetic quality is the soul-searching introspection evident in the scene,â wrote New York magazine regarding the debut paintings of an artist who had only picked up a paintbrush for the first time a year earlier. The artist, a New York Times art critic wrote, was âsomething of a natural when it comes to oil paintings,â a man possessing âunsettling talent.â By all accounts, these were raves&#8212;a surprise for any critic reviewing a newcomer, but infinitesimally more surprising given that that artist was George W. Bush.\n<p>It turns out that George W. Bush, the former fortunate First Son turned beloved Texas governor turned reviled 43rd president of the United States, spent the years following his tumultuous twin turns in the Oval Office tucked away in his Dallas home with a painting. His attention to detail was uncanny for a politician previously deemed so incurious. His work first hit the worldâs stage in 2013, just four years after leaving the White House, when a Romanian hacker revealed images of two self-portraits Bush had created of himself&#8212;one in the shower, and one in the bathtub. In the years since, Bush has focused his work outward, on landscapes and world leaders. In 2014, his presidential library exhibited 30 portraits heâd painted of people like Tony Blair, Vladimir Putin, and Angela Merkel.</p>\n<p>Bush, the eponymous eldest son of the 41st commander in chief of the United States, had the presidential pedigree. As a Yale undergraduate and Harvard Business School veteran who completed stints as an oil executive and Major League Baseball team owner before serving as governor of the second-largest state, Bush also had a folksy, southern twanging, malaprop-popping relatability about him. He was a true Connecticut cowboy&#8212;an Ivy Leaguer with White House roots and Texas boots who practically invented the idea that a president should be someone the electorate would want to down a beer with. He could not correctly pronounce ânuclear,â yet he could pull off starting a get-out-the-vote campaign speech with a story about pig manure.</p>\n<p>On the issue of voting, Bushâs first bid for the White House against then sitting vice president Al Gore was so close it came down to a recount and, eventually, a Supreme Court ruling. It all came down to votes in Florida, to ballots and âhanging chads,â and weeks of legal battles until the high court declared an end to the recount, with Bush as the victor. It was the fourth time in history that a president took the White House but did not win the popular vote.</p>\n<p>Bushâs presidency was equally fraught. Less than eight months after assuming office, two planes flew straight into the Twin Towers in New York City, toppling them to the ground. Another flew into the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed in Pennsylvania. The events of September 11, 2001, ultimately launched a global war on terror&#8212;an invasion into Afghanistan to stop the Taliban and another into Iraq over weapons of mass destruction, which never materialized&#8212;that continues to this day. He weathered Hurricane Katrina, some would say unsuccessfully, enacted the Patriot Act, No Child Left Behind, and controversial interrogations at GuantÃ¡namo Bay. When he left office in 2009, Bushâs approval rating was at 22 percent&#8212;the lowest in the 70 years Gallup had been tracking the figure. Thanks in large part to the electoral and constituent-gathering mastery of Karl Rove, it all worked.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/5743321a4f6c70a31f05167d_hive-contributor-profile-george-bush.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 12:39 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-george-bush.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-george-bush.jpg","credit":"By Chris Condon/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5743321a55f979a31fa9897d","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 12:38 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 12:39 pm","description":"Getty not 250:491769588","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/george-w-bush","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/5743321a4f6c70a31f05167d_hive-contributor-profile-george-bush.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 12:39 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-george-bush.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-george-bush.jpg","credit":"By Chris Condon/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5743321a55f979a31fa9897d","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 12:38 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 12:39 pm","description":"Getty not 250:491769588","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"searchable":true,"expired":false,"revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/george-w-bush","distributionChannels":[{"name":"web-owned-and-operated","metadata":{"searchable":true}}],"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revision":6,"entityId":"573622a384cb4922586cd0a3"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Trump Now Calling George Conway a âStone-Cold Loserâ and âHusband from Hellâ","promoHed":"Trump Now Calling George Conway a âStone-Cold Loserâ and âHusband from Hellâ","dek":"The marriage expert has weighed in.","promoDek":"The marriage expert has weighed in.","body":"<p>Earlier this week, longtime <strong>Donald Trump</strong> critic <strong>George Conway,</strong> the husband of senior White House adviser <strong>Kellyanne,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/george-kellyanne-conway-twitter-feud\">tweeted</a> a series of screenshots from the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1107601427545899008\">warned</a> that âall Americans should be thinking seriously <em>now</em> about Trumpâs mental condition and psychological state, including and especially the media, Congress&#8212;and the Vice President and Cabinet.â And on Wednesday, the president did his best to prove Conwayâs point, re: him being clinically insane.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/donald-trump-george-conway-kellyanne-conway-loser\">calling</a> the conservative attorney âa total loser!â the day prior, Trump woke up on Wednesday morning and decided the best use of his time would be to tweet this:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108335293671845888\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108335293671845888\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108335293671845888</a></p></blockquote></div><p>As a reminder, this manâs official title is president of the United States, and <em>not,</em> as his online ravings would suggest, Chairman of the <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shithouse%20mouse\">Shithouse-Mouse</a> Council.

Term Still Ticking by Her Bedside","promoHed":"Barbara Bush Died with a Countdown Clock to the End of Trumpâs Term Still Ticking by Her Bedside","dek":"A horror story in two paragraphs.","promoDek":"A horror story in two paragraphs.","body":"<p><strong>Jordan Peele</strong> recently wrote two excellent horror screenplays. In addition, <em>The Babadook</em> was quite spooky before the titular character <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/the-babadook-movie-gay-icon?verso=true\">became a gay icon</a>. I still havenât <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2018/6/11/17450110/hereditary-wikipedia-horror-movie-review\">read the Wikipedia</a> page for <em>Hereditary,</em> but from what I understand, itâs extremely scary.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, none of those earn the title of most terrifying horror story. In fact, they might as well be PBS viewing for toddlers compared to the scariest story of all, the one contained in two paragraphs of a new Barbara Bush biography, excerpted in <em>USA Today:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After Trump was elected, a friend in Kennebunkport gave her a Trump\ncountdown clock as a joke. The red, white, and blue digital clock\ndisplayed how many days, hours, minutes and seconds remained in\nTrumpâs term. She parked it on the side table in her bedroom, next to\nthe chair she would sit in to needlepoint or watch television.</p>\n<p>She liked the countdown clock so much that when the Bushes returned to\nHouston that October, she brought it with her. It sat on her bedside\ntable, where she could see it every day. It was there to the day she\ndied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do you feel that coldness? That icy shot to the kidneys? It hits at the precise moment one realizes itâs possible to expire before the presidency countdown clock on the bedside table does. What horror show is this? What perfect torment?</p>\n<p>The biography was penned by <strong>Susan Page,</strong> the Washington Bureau chief of <em>USA Today,</em> who interviewed the Bush family matriarch in the final six months of her life and had access to the former First Ladyâs diaries. (Bush died nearly a year ago in Houston at 92, just over seven months before the death of her husband, former president George H.W. Bush.) Between the beginning of Pageâs time with Bush and the end of it, something changed. âDid she still consider herself a Republican? In an interview with me in October 2017, she answered that question yes,â Page wrote. âWhen I asked her again four months later, in February 2018, she said, âIâd probably say no today.ââ</p>\n<p>Itâs certainly notable when news breaks that a blue-chip Republican finds little of value in the party today. But before one welcomes the ghost of Barbara Bush to the resistance, remember that her particular anti-Trump hostility came from the potent mix of maternal instinct and Reagan-era pride. In the 80s, Page wrote, Bush saw through <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> cartoonish, ham-fisted grasping. She took issue with his needling of Ronald and Nancy Reagan at a charity benefit in one diary entry. Then in another, after the media reported <strong>Ivana</strong> wasnât satisfied with her $25 million divorce settlement, Bush wrote in her diary, âThe Trumps are a new word, both of them. Trump now means Greed, selfishness and ugly. So sad.â</p>\n<p>Little did she know that a quarter of a century later, âGreedâ would be cyberbullying her son <strong>Jeb</strong> and giving her a heart attack. According to Page, she attributed a flare-up of her congestive heart failure and chronic pulmonary disease during the presidential campaign to the âangstâ Trump had caused her family and the country. Itâs amazing how you can see exactly who a person is, and then watch him get worse. Maybe thatâs the most frightening horror story of all.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why canât we get <a

This will be good news for two reasons. First, lawmakers will get to read a report that may or may not show evidence of collusion between <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> 2016 campaign and a hostile foreign government. Just as important, <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> will then be free to move on to more pressing matters that demand his singular investigatory skills. Namely, what the absolute fuck is going on in the Conway household?</p>\n<p>For those who need a recap: over the weekend, conservative lawyer <strong>George Conway,</strong> husband to White House adviser <strong>Kellyanne,</strong> stepped up his frequent attacks on the president by suggesting&#8212;quite reasonably!&#8212;that Donald Trump suffers at least two personality disorders that make him unfit for office. Many in the mental-health community have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrElizabethRose/status/1107706364426625024\">been saying this for some time now</a>, but, for some reason, Conwayâs tweets struck a nerve. Between Tuesday and late Wednesday morning, the president responded by alternatively describing one of his employeeâs spouses as â<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/donald-trump-george-conway-kellyanne-conway-loser\">a total loser</a>,â a â<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108335293671845888\">stone cold loser</a>,â the â<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/trump-george-conway-stone-cold-loser-husband-from-hell\">husband from hell</a>,â a â<a href=\"https://twitter.com/karentravers/status/1108407583017259008\">whack job</a>,â and â<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/husband-from-hell-trump-escalates-feud-with-spouse-of-kellyanne-conway/2019/03/20/587a03d8-4b07-11e9-93d0-64dbcf38ba41_story.html?utm_term=.0cfb71e5dcc4\">Mr. Kellyanne Conway</a>,â the latter of which was definitely not intended to be a compliment.</p>\n<p>And according to Kellyanne, the person in the wrong here <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/20/kellyanne-george-conway-trump-1229193\">is her husband</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday defended President Donald Trumpâs attacks on her husband George Conway saying heâs âa counterpuncherâ and asserting that the president is free to respond when heâs accused of having a mental illness. âHe left it alone for months out of respect for me,â Conway, a senior Trump aide, told Politico in a brief telephone interview. âBut you think he shouldnât respond when somebody, a non-medical professional accuses him of having a mental disorder? You think he should just take that sitting down? Donât play psychiatrist any more than George should be. Youâre not a psychiatrist and heâs not, respectfully.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âThe president is obviously defending me,â she added, before implying that he (the president) calls her âhoneyâ rather than âKellyanne,â which, to be fair, is better than âsweetums.â âHe could privately say to me, âHoney youâre a distraction. We love you. Youâll always be a part of the family but go be with your kids. They need you. Go make a million dollars an hour. Go do that honey.â Itâs the opposite.â</p>\n<p>The Conway marriage has long been a head-scratcher and not just because the two people in it have vastly different opinions about one of their bosses. Last August, Kellyanne <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/she-works-for-trump-he-cant-stand-him-this-is-life-with-kellyanne-and-george-conway/2018/08/15/3b89b82a-9b46-11e8-843b-36e177f3081c_story.html\">trash-talked</a> George in the pages of <em>The Washington Post</em> and then tried to get reporter <strong>Ben Terris</strong> to attribute her comments to âa person familiar with their relationship.â Terris declined to do so.</p>\n<p>Anyway, itâs obvious that this psychosexual drama is far from over. After being doubled-teamed by his wife and her boss, George doubled down on his claim that Trump is â<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1108342289217261568\">nuts</a>,â and in a move that will undoubtedly lead to (another) Oval Office-meltdown, suggested that heâs going to prison:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed

Videos surround the installation, featuring the most memorable moments from the march.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, the actress and activist <strong>Sophia Bush</strong> was surveying the space and was a little taken aback. âNot to be totally cheesy, but I walked into the rotunda, and Iâm looking at the videos playing and the installation, and Iâm remembering what it felt like to go to the first Womenâs March,â she said. âI started crying.â Bush was on hand for a panel, The Face of Change, hosted by <em>Vanity Fair</em> and Jane Walker by Johnnie Walker in honor of International Womenâs Day, celebrated annually on March 8. In addition to Bush, the panel featured Senior Vice President of Whiskies at Diageo North America <strong>Sophie Kelly,</strong> Axios chief technology officer <strong>Jess Szmajda,</strong> and Detroit Blows beauty salon founder and C.E.O of  <strong>Nia Batts.</strong> <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs <strong>Claire Landsbaum</strong> moderated their discussion, which covered the wide spectrum of their personal and professional stories.</p>\n<p>While each panelist viewed being a woman in business through a different lens, each had plenty to say about representation (or lack thereof) in the modern workplace. Szmajda, who in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/axios-names-jess-szmajda-as-its-new-cto\">joining Axios three weeks ago</a> became one of the first transgender technology leaders of a mainstream media property, spoke about how empowering such examples are. âThere are no stories of successful trans women,â  Szmajda said of the landscape up to now. âEverybody needs to see people like them in a position of success.â</p>\n<p>Batts, who founded Detroit Blows with Bush, also made the case for the power of such individual stories. âThis conversation around representation is one that Iâve had throughout all the industries Iâve been fortunate enough to work in,â Batts said. âBut especially being a young female executive, there was always that idea of, âWhen is the appropriate time for me to speak?ââ Batts went on to say her parents taught her early on that there were always going to be odds stacked against her. âI grew up with parents who were old-school, and they say, âWhen you walk into the room, youâre going to have two strikes against you: theyâre going to look at you and know that youâre a woman, and know that youâre black,ââ she said, recalling the initial struggles of breaking into business. âSo I was always conscious about being prepared, making sure that I was doing a good job. . . . But I eventually grew into taking up that space.â</p>\n<p>Speaking with <em>Vanity Fair</em> after the panel, Bush said that while the current state of the womenâs movement has had a monumental impact, women in business need to play their part in creating a society that is more inclusive for all. âEverybody loves to roll their eyes at female entrepreneurs,â Bush said. âThere was no way that we were going to let this fail. Not an option.â</p>\n<p>Bush recalled the first Womenâs March, in 2017, where many women were still reeling from <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> election. âI think there was certainly fear and exasperation in the air,â Bush she said. âI donât think anybody expected us to be in that position, but I also think that we were reminded that there were plenty of reasons we should have been marching before.â</p>","rubric":"The Face of Change","socialTitle":"Sophia Bush and More on Female Entrepreneurship and the Power of Representation","socialDescription":"In honor of International Womenâs Day, four female entrepreneurs shared their greatest triumphs and struggles at The Face of Change panel, presented by Jane Walker by Johnnie Walker.","seoTitle":"Sophia Bush and More on Female Entrepreneurship and the Power of Representation","seoDescription":"In honor of International Womenâs Day, four female entrepreneurs shared their greatest triumphs and struggles at The Face of Change panel, presented by Jane Walker by Johnnie Walker.","channel":"Style","subChannel":"","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"Sophia Bush at the Signs of Progress exhibit at the New York Historical Society Center for Womenâs History.","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":[],"revisionAuthor":"Claire Landsbaum","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c82843f52ce6720b360803b","revision":34,"createdAt":"March 8, 2019 10:03 am","modifiedAt":"March 8, 2019 4:45 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"March 8, 2019 4:45 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Style","slug":"style","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","name":"Sarah Shoen","bio":"","socialMedia":[],"meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"email":"sarah_shoen@condenast.com","channel":"","subChannel":"","id":"5964f13a3a5a726a87a63010","revision":3,"createdAt":"July 11, 2017 11:39 am","modifiedAt":"July 11, 2017 11:40 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 11, 2017 11:40 am","title":"","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors"}}],"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Sarah Shoen","filename":"Signs-of-Progress-Panel-Lede.jpg","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1998,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":1998,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":2000,"height":1199,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":57,"height":1199,"width":2000}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":888,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":888,"x":556,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":747,"height":1328,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1328,"width":747,"x":626.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1994,"height":854,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":5,"y":478,"height":854,"width":1994}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2000,"height":1125,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":207,"height":1125,"width":2000}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1776,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":1776,"x":112,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1333,"height":1333,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1333,"width":1333,"x":333.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2019/03/08/5c82b4e305d3ef2d4234eb23_Signs-of-Progress-Panel-Lede.jpg","width":2000,"height":1333,"duration":null}},"title":"Signs-of-Progress-Panel-Lede.jpg","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5c82b4e305d3ef2d4234eb24","revision":1,"createdAt":"March 8, 2019 1:30 pm","modifiedAt":"March 8, 2019 1:35 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"March 8, 2019 1:35 pm","altText":"Sophia Bush admires The Face of Change exhibit.

Kellyanne, who steered Trumpâs campaign, became infamous early on for her ardent and recursive defenses, characterized by reality-bending personal attacks on those who dared question the president. Meanwhile George, a lawyer, has become a full-time Trump critic. Over the weekend, while Trump rage-tweeted about <em>Saturday Night Live,</em> George launched a heretofore unprecedented offensive, tweeting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1107598527490916354\">pages</a> from the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,</em> including an entry for âNarcissistic Personality Disorder: a pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy.â</p>\n<p>George Conway also re-tweeted media and political figures skeptical of the presidentâs fitness for office, at times appending his agreement. âDonât assume that the things he says and does are part of a rational plan or strategy, because they seldom are,â he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1107597871778545664\">wrote</a> at one point, quote-tweeting Never Trumper <strong>Bill Kristol.</strong> âConsider them as a product of his pathologies, and they make perfect sense.â</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1107601427545899008\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1107601427545899008\">https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1107601427545899008</a></p></blockquote></div><p>This weekendâs split-screen extended to other topics. Around the time George was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BradMossEsq/status/1107275756164526081\">re-tweeting</a> criticism of Trump for failing to sufficiently address the mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, Kellyanne popped up on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> to take the opposite stance. âI guess everybody scoured it and searched for Donald Trumpâs name,â she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/revrrlewis/status/1107632028403539968\">said</a> of the shooterâs manifesto, which mentioned the president as a source of inspiration. She went on to argue that the gunman was more of an âeco-naturalist or an eco-fascistâ than a white nationalist, and that âpeople should read the [manifesto] in its entiretyâ for proof that Trump is blameless.</p>\n<p>The definitive piece on the Conway marriage, published in <em>The Washington Post</em> in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/she-works-for-trump-he-cant-stand-him-this-is-life-with-kellyanne-and-george-conway/2018/08/15/3b89b82a-9b46-11e8-843b-36e177f3081c_story.html\">August 2018</a>, depicted their divided household as one in which they frequently butt heads over Kellyanneâs position as Trumpâs chief defender. Their marriage survives, the article posits, by the grace of a 15,000-square-foot house, where each can get some distance from the other. One of the most-cited exchanges came when writer <strong>Ben Terris</strong> pressed Kellyanne on whether she found Georgeâs tweets âdisrespectfulâ and she tried (and failed) to play the âoff the recordâ card:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kellyanne: It is disrespectful, itâs a violation of basic decency, certainly, if not marital vows .â.â. as âa person familiar with their relationship.â\nMe: No, weâre on the record here. You canât say after the fact âas someone familiar.â\nKellyanne: Fine. Iâve never actually said what I think about it and I wonât say what I think about it, which tells you what I think about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since then, in the words of George himself, things have only gotten worse.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/CarolLeonnig/status/1107701670883090433\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarolLeonnig/status/1107701670883090433\">https://twitter.com/CarolLeonnig/status/1107701670883090433</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What does âelite universityâ even mean?

Just because Republicans ought to be given a choice.â","body":"<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> may be the presumptive G.O.P. candidate for the 2020 election cycle, but that doesnât mean the partyâs voters are enamored of the concept. A recent Marist poll <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-poll-results-analysis/#sthash.KLQA1an4.GDVivfIh.dpbs\">found</a> that 44 percent of Republican voters would like to see a primary challenger. Four in 10 Republican voters feel the same way in <a href=\"https://www.insidesources.com/exclusive-4-10-n-h-republicans-support-2020-primary-challenge-president-trump/\">New Hampshire</a>, as do more than 60 percent in <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2018/12/17/trump-iowa-republicans-2020-election-white-house-democrats-campaign-romney-sasse-rubio-kasich-flake/2312476002/\">Iowa</a>. But with the exception of casual Libertarian <strong>Bill Weld,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bill-weld-2020-republican-primary-challenge\">announced</a> his intention to take on Trump in 2020, there have been few Republicans willing to speak up for the silent minority&#8212;until now.</p>\n<p>Emerging from obscurity to undermine Trump is none other than former Florida governor <strong>Jeb Bush,</strong> the onetime presumptive candidate for the G.O.P. presidential nomination who was mercilessly and unexpectedly crushed under the heel of Trumpism in 2016. âI think someone should run. Just because Republicans ought to be given a choice,â <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/politics/jeb-bush-trump-2020-cnntv/index.html\">he tells</a> former Obama strategist <strong>David Axelrod</strong> in an episode of <em>The Axe Files</em> airing Saturday. It would be hard to overcome Trumpâs âloyal base,â Bush admits, much less unseat a sitting president in a primary. âBut to have a conversation about what it is to be a conservative I think is important.â</p>\n<p>Of course, Republican primary voters had such a choice in 2016, when they soundly rejected Jeb Bushâs pro-immigration, pro-free-trade <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-bush/jeb-bush-strikes-softer-tone-at-start-of-white-house-run-idUSKBN0OV0CW20150615\">version of conservatism</a> in favor of strident nationalism, border walls, adultery, and various other manifestations of American Greatness. As a result, Bush never broke above fourth place in any primary, despite having <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/politics/jeb-bush-campaign.html\">$130 million</a> in his campaign coffers. He ultimately dropped out after pulling in just 8 percent of the vote in South Carolina. (Trump took the state with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/south-carolina\">32.5 percent</a>.)</p>\n<p>Then again, much has changed in the three years since Bush famously begged voters to âplease clapâ for his platform. Trumpâs tax cuts have benefited the wealthy and his trade wars have hurt farmers; the stock market is trending sideways; Americaâs foreign policy is in disarray; and the Mueller report looms. Trump retains the support of almost <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/245996/trump-job-approval-sets-new-record-polarization.aspx\">90 percent</a> of Republican voters, for now. But the next several months could force centrist conservatives to make some hard choices. Bush, for one, still believes in the possibility of a Republican white knight to reunite the party around a truly conservative vision to address issues like income inequality, immigration, and global warming. âOur country needs to have competing ideologies that people&#8212;that are dynamic, that focus on the world weâre in and the world weâre moving towards rather than revert back to a nostalgic time,â he told Axelrod.</p>\n<p>So far, none of the candidates openly mulling primary runs against Trump are really offering that vision, and few Republican voters are buying whatever theyâre selling. Last month, an Emerson College poll <a href=\"https://www.emerson.edu/news-events/emerson-college-today-unpublished/iowa-poll-one-year-out-caucus-biden-leads-democratic-field-third-party-candidacy-helps-trump#.XIveghNKh0t\">found</a> that <strong>John Kasich,</strong> the former Ohio governor with a platform closest to Bushâs, would be crushed by Trump in the Iowa caucuses by 90 points. Weld, who announced a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bill-weld-2020-republican-primary-challenge\">kamikaze-style mission</a> to challenge Trump in the primaries, is so unpopular that political insiders in New Hampshire&#8212;the state where the former Massachusetts governor hopes to establish his name&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.insidesources.com/bill-weld-the-worst-possible-primary-challenger-to-take-on-trump-2/\">called his quixotic run</a> âa weaponâ Trump could use âto beat up future challengers, to dismiss them all as âjust another Bill Weld.ââ</p>\n<p>Bush isnât giving up hope. On <em>The Axe Files,</em> he mentions <strong>Larry Hogan,</strong> the moderate Republican governor of blue-state Maryland, as âat the top of a list of leaders that I admire today.â Bush notes that when he spoke at Hoganâs second inauguration as governor of Maryland in January&#8212;during which Hogan quietly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/larry-hogan-2020-republican-primary-challenge\">denounced Trump</a>&#8212;he got an inkling that Hogan might be mulling a run. âI didnât realize I was part of his pre-campaign,â he jokes. Hopefully heâs not giving Hogan campaign advice, too.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What does âelite universityâ even mean?

Martin&#8212;who hasnât actively worked on the HBO series since Season 4&#8212;neither visited the set nor even read any scripts for the final season. The author has also <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/03/06/george-rr-martin-game-of-thrones-season-8-interview/\">admitted</a> that he has âmixed feelingsâ about the highly anticipated Season 8.</p>\n<p>Itâs clear that the show outpacing his original book series has been a source of strain for Martin. He said as much to <em>Vanity Fair</em> way back in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/04/game-of-thrones-season-4\">2014</a>, calling the prospect âalarming.â Martin famously revealed a few key milestones from his yet-to-be-written books to series show-runners <strong>D.B. Weiss</strong> and <strong>David Benioff</strong> ahead of time, including the emotional reveal of Hodorâs death in Season 6. In Season 5, when outcry over the death of young Shireen Baratheon troubled the showâs fan base, Weiss and Benioff were able to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/stannis-burns-shireen-game-of-thrones-dance-of-dragons\">deflect criticism</a> by implying that Martin had told them the young girl burns in the book as well.</p>\n<p>But donât expect the duo to outline which aspects of the showâs conclusion they also got from Martin. As Benioff recently told <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>: âOne thing weâve talked to George about is that weâre not going to tell people what the differences are, so when those books come out people can experience them fresh.â Benioff added that though Martin laid out the shape of his saga to them years ago, âGeorge discovers a lot of stuff while heâs writing.â So fans may have to wait until Martin publishes <em>The Winds of Winter</em> and <em>A Dream of Spring</em> before theyâre able to compare and contrast Martinâs plan with the version that will play out on HBO.</p>\n<p>Still, the implication for years has been that while Weiss, Benioff, and their writers may have taken a few detours along the way&#8212;ones Martin <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/game-of-thrones-tamzin-merchant-daenerys-george-rr-martin-cameo-season-8\">may or may not approve of</a>&#8212;theyâre ultimately headed toward the same goal, and the same general ending, that the author laid out to them years ago. So rest assured that Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen <em>are</em> Jon Snowâs parents in the books, as well as on the series.</p>\n<p>Martin has repeatedly said that his fans wonât get the full story from the show alone. After all, characters whom Martin feels are important to his narrative have already been killed off on the show, or were never included in the series at all. âI havenât read the [final-season] scripts and havenât been able to visit the set because Iâve been working on <em>Winds,</em>â Martin himself told<em>E.W.</em> âI know some of the thingsâ&#8212;but not precisely how the show itself will end.</p>\n<p>Martin still obviously has a relationship with the series; though he has not appeared at any of its red carpet premieres since 2015, he still shows up to collect Emmy trophies. âItâs been an incredible ride,â Martin said. âAnd almost all of it has been great. Obviously, I wished I finished these books sooner, so the show hadnât gotten ahead of me. I never anticipated that.â He added: âThereâs a lot of minor-character [arcs] theyâll be coming up with on their own. And, of course, they passed me several years ago. There may be important discrepancies.â In other words, fans, youâll <em>still</em> have to do the reading if you want to consider yourself a <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> completist.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/10-undeniable-facts-about-the-michael-jackson-sexual-abuse-allegations?inline\">10 undeniable facts</a> about Michael Jacksonâs sexual abuse allegations</p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/bob-greenblatt-hbo-plepler-battle-with-netflix?inline\">new HBO</a>&#8212;and its coming battle with Netflix</p>\n<p>&#8212; <em>Captain Marvel</em> is a period piece, a space adventure, and an attempt at feminist filmmaking&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/captain-marvel-movie-review?inline\">and, our critic writes, it mostly succeeds</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Thought <em>Borat</em> was daring?

Martin Turn Down a Cameo on <em>Game of Thrones</em> Season 8?","dek":"In his own words.","promoDek":"In his own words.","body":"<p>According to show-runners <strong>D.B. Weiss</strong> and <strong>David Benioff</strong> the original pilot episode of <em>Game of Thrones</em> was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/02/game-of-thrones-original-pilot-bad\">unforgivably bad</a>. So bad, in fact, that despite fan demand for it, nearly none of the episode has ever seen the light of day&#8212;even on the darkest corners of the Internet. Among the scenes lost on the cutting-room floor is one in which <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> author <strong>George R.R. Martin</strong> appears in his one and only cameo on the series, playing a guest at Daenerys Targaryenâs wedding feast. When <strong>Emilia Clarke</strong> replaced original Daenerys actress <strong>Tamzin Merchant,</strong> Martinâs footage got the ax.</p>\n<p>Nearly a decade later, Martin was offered another chance to show his bearded, Westeros-ready face in the showâs eighth and final season&#8212;but this time, the author declined the honor, claiming he was too busy working on the long-delayed <em>The Winds of Winter.</em> Is that the only reason why?</p>\n<p>Speaking with <em>Entertainment Weekly,</em> Martin <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/02/27/george-rr-martin-game-of-thrones-season-8-cameo/\">said</a>: âDavid and Dan invited me to a cameo in one of the final episodes, which I was tempted to do. But I didnât think just for the sake of a cameo I could take the time to return to Belfast.â</p>\n<p>Martin is, by all reports, redoubling his efforts to complete this highly anticipated book, going so far as to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-assures-fans-writing-is-coming-1542390476?mod=e2tw&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj\">hole up in a cabin</a> to avoid distractions from the outside world. But Martin has also apparently been distancing himself from the TV series, which outpaced his writing years ago now. The last script Martin wrote for the series was for Season 4&#8212;which aired in 2014. When comparing an <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/game-of-thrones-george-rr-martin-last-script-the-lion-and-the-rose\">early draft of his script</a> to the episode that eventually aired, itâs easy to see how far the show had already diverged from Martinâs vision.</p>\n<p>Season 4 was also the year of an infamous sex scene between Jaime and Cersei Lannister, which played out as non-consensual on the screen&#8212;another departure from Martinâs book. âThe whole dynamic is different in the show,â he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/04/game-of-thrones-author-weighs-in-on-rape\">said</a> at the time. âThe setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why Dan &amp; David played the sept out differently. But that&#39;s just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection.â</p>\n<p>And in 2015, when a Season 5 sexual assault on Sansa Stark sent shock waves through the fan base, Martin <a href=\"https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/game-of-thrones-sansa-stark-rape-scene-george-r-r-martin-1201500050/\">reiterated</a> his hands-off stance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There have been differences between the novels and the television show\nsince the first episode of season one. And for just as long, I have\nbeen talking about the butterfly effect. Small changes lead to larger\nchanges lead to huge changes. David (Benioff) and Dan (Weiss) and\n<strong>Bryan (Cogman)</strong> and HBO are trying to make the best television series\nthat they can. And over here I am trying to write the best novels that\nI can. And yes, more and more, they differ. Two roads diverging in the\ndark of the woods, I suppose . . . but all of us are still intending that\nat the end we will arrive at the same place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Martin never wrote another script for the series after Season 4, claiming, again, that he was too busy working on <em>The Winds of Winter.</em> âWriting a script takes me three weeks, minimum, and longer when it is not a straight adaptation from the novels. Writing a season six script would cost me a monthâs work on WINDS, and maybe as much as six weeks, and I cannot afford that,â he <a href=\"https://grrm.livejournal.com/415405.html\">wrote</a> in 2015. âWith David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, and Bryan Cogman on board, the scriptwriting chores for season six should be well covered. My energies are best devoted to WINDS.â</p>\n<p>Martin also vanished from the annual Comic-Con panels in 2015&#8212;where he had once been a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/comic-con-game-thrones-season-3-george-rr-martin-349198\">fixture</a>&#8212;again citing his obligation to <em>Winds.</em> The book has yet to be published, though the author has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/game-of-thrones-george-rr-martin-chapter-winds-of-winter-dorne\">released chapters here and there</a> even as the show outstripped Martin. Often, those early glimpses at <em>Winds</em> seemed to be in direct conversation with choices Weiss and Benioff had made&#8212;especially when they decided to disregard Martinâs source material. In 2016, for example, when the series all but wiped out its Dornish characters in what was, reportedly, a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/game-of-thrones-alexander-siddig-interview-leaked-game-of-thrones-screeners\">late-in-the-day</a> effort to cut free from a subplot that wasnât working on the screen, Martin wrote on his <a href=\"https://grrm.livejournal.com/487298.html\">blog</a>: âYou want to know what the Sand Snakes, Prince Doran, Areo Hotah, Ellaria Sand, Darkstar, and the rest will be up to in WINDS OF WINTER? Quite a lot, actually. The sample will give you a taste. For the rest, you will need to wait.â</p>\n<p>Martin was similarly in dialogue with the show when he released a Sansa-centric chapter titled âAlayneâ (her alter-ego at that point in the books), one month before the infamous 2015 episode âUnbowed, Unbent, Unbrokenâ showed Sansaâs traumatic wedding night. In Martinâs chapter, Sansa is safely (well, âsafelyâ) ensconced at the Eyrie and nowhere near Winterfell, Ramsay, and his terrible dogs.</p>\n<p>In recent years, Martin has absented himself from a number of public appearances in order to focus on his written work&#8212;like the 2018 Targaryen history <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/fire-and-blood-spoilers-game-of-thrones-easter-eggs-daenerys-dragon-eggs-tyrion-targaryen\">Fire &amp; Blood</a>.</em> He went on a mini book tour for <em>Fire &amp; Blood,</em> and did some promotional work for the erstwhile SyFy series <em>Nightflyers.</em> But while he still shows up at the Emmy awards every year to collect his trophies for <em>Thrones,</em> Martin hasnât been to a premiere of the HBO series since 2015. Perhaps heâll show up to the April premiere for the final hurrah, even if he doesnât have time to film a full cameo. Or perhaps, once again, heâll be writing. As he put it in <a href=\"https://grrm.livejournal.com/429752.html\">2015</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I know that <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> named me âthe third most\npowerful writer in Hollywoodâ last December. You would be surprised at\nhow little that means. I cannot control what anyone else says or does,\nor make them stop saying or doing it, be it on the fannish or\nprofessional fronts. What I can control is what happens in my books,\nso I am going to return to that chapter Iâve been writing on The Winds\nof Winter now, thank you very much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; âThereâs no tragedyâ: Selma Blair <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/selma-blairs-transformation?inline\">opens up about her M.S. diagnosis</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What <em>Green Book</em>âs best-picture win <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/what-green-books-best-picture-oscar-does-and-does-not-mean?inline\">means about movie awards</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; How Rami Malek <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/oscars-2019-rami-malek-wins-best-actor-speech-bryan-singer?inline\">went from underdog to best-actor winner</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Meghan Markleâs $200K baby shower: <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/meghan-markle-baby-shower?inline\">an in-depth analysis</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Look at these <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2019/02/inside-the-2019-vanity-fair-oscar-party?inline\">Oscar party photos</a>!</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Game On","socialTitle":"Why Did George R.R.

To date, though, only one person who actively disparages <strong>Donald Trump</strong> online also has the distinction of being married to one of his most prominent White House employees: <strong>George Conway,</strong> husband to presidential adviser <strong>Kellyanne.</strong> Unlike his wife, Conway is known for questioning the presidentâs competence and mental state, a habit he continued over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/george-kellyanne-conway-twitter-feud\">tweeting</a> screenshots from the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder</em>, including an entry for Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and warning that âall Americans should be thinking seriously <em>now</em> about Trumpâs mental condition and psychological state, including and especially the media, Congress&#8212;and the Vice President and Cabinet.â According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-total-loser-trump-lashes-out-at-george-conway-who-has-been-questioning-his-mental-health/2019/03/19/c81bcec0-4a43-11e9-93d0-64dbcf38ba41_story.html?utm_term=.9086738c1d4a\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Trump has âwanted to attack George Conway on Twitter beforeâ but was talked down by aides. This time, he couldnât resist. Georgeâs tweets didnât sit right with the president, and on Tuesday he responded <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=loser%20from%3Arealdonaldtrump&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">the only way he knows how</a>.</p>\n<p>âA total loser!â Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1107983725034463232\">tweeted</a>, re-tweeting a claim by his 2020 campaign manager, <strong>Brad Parscale,</strong> that the president âdoesnât even knowâ his senior adviserâs husband, and that the only reason Conway attacks Trump is out of bitterness over losing out on a job and jealousy of his wifeâs success. Unfortunately, like so many statements that come out of Trumpâs mouth, this one <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-total-loser-trump-lashes-out-at-george-conway-who-has-been-questioning-his-mental-health/2019/03/19/c81bcec0-4a43-11e9-93d0-64dbcf38ba41_story.html\">doesnât hold up in the face of reality</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>George Conway said in an interview with <em>The Washington Post</em> Tuesday that he has had a number of notable interactions with Trump over the past decade, often concerning legal representation and sensitive legal matters since Trump became president. He described the president as âmendaciousâ and âincompetentâ and predicted he would not win reelection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conway said that contrary to Parscaleâs tweet, he opted against working at the Justice Department after Trump offered him a position heading the civil division because he watched Trump attack the departmentâs leaders and then fire <strong>James B. Comey,</strong> the F.B.I. director, in early 2017. Conway said he remembered riding down the West Side Highway in Manhattan and hearing on the radio that special counsel <strong>Robert S. Mueller III</strong> had been appointed to lead an investigation of possible connections between Russian election interference and the Trump campaign. âIâm thinking to myself, this guy is going to be at war with the Justice Department for the next two years,â Conway said. âIâm not doing this.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Conway told the <em>Post</em>, heâs met Trump on numerous occasions, including instances in which the president has asked him for legal advice, or for his opinion on various potential legal hires. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shortly after they were married in 2001, Kellyanne and George Conway moved into an apartment in Manhattanâs Trump World Tower. A few years later, George Conway made an impression on the future president at a condominium board meeting where he argued against removing Trumpâs name from the building. The speech earned him an offer to join the condo board, which he declined but passed on to his wife, who accepted. In a 2006 letter shared with The Washington Post, Trump praised Conway for helping him keep control of the building.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for the assertion that George is jealous of Kellyanne, Conway told the <em>Post</em> he is âproudâ of his wifeâs ability to get this stain on U.S. history elected, and harbors no envy, though he wishes she didnât work in the White House. The senior adviser to the president, however, apparently feels otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kellyanne Conway went on a lengthy rant about her husband to several guests at a British Embassy party for members of Congress last month, including New York Times columnist <strong>Maureen Dowd,</strong> NBC anchor <strong>Andrea Mitchell,</strong> and former Post journalist <strong>Sally Quinn,</strong> according to two attendees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conway told the group that she and the president think her husband is jealous of her, and that the president has kept her at a prominent place in the administration because he trusts her and wants to âprotect her,â the attendees said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the greatest marriage counselors on earth probably couldnât unpack the psychosexual drama that is the Conway union, according to George, his tweets attacking his wifeâs boss arenât a slight against her, as <strong>Eric Trump</strong> has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1069765937568628736\">suggested</a>, but <em>for</em> her. âThe tweeting is just the way to get it out of the way, so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day,â he told the <em>Post</em> âThatâs basically it. Frankly, itâs so I donât end up screaming at her about it.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What does âelite universityâ even mean?

wine!","body":"<p>Months ahead of <strong>Kathie Lee Giffordâs</strong>  departure from the <em>Today</em> show, NBC has found her replacement. <strong>Jenna Bush Hager,</strong> the longtime front-runner for the job, will soon be by <strong>Hoda Kotbâs</strong> side in the morning showâs fourth hour.</p>\n<p>Over 11 years, Kotb and Gifford have developed one of TVâs most beloved friendships, furnished by their easy chemistry and penchant for day-drinking. On Tuesday morning, NBC <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/jenna-bush-hager-joins-hoda-kotb-co-host-today-show-t149429\">revealed</a> the news as Bush Hager appeared on <em>Today</em> to announce it herself.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/klgandhoda/status/1100413383684182028\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/klgandhoda/status/1100413383684182028\">https://twitter.com/klgandhoda/status/1100413383684182028</a></p></blockquote></div><p>âI want to weep!â Bush Hager said. âIt feels humbling and I canât believe it. My dad just wrote me three words, which made me weep. He said, âVery proud dad.ââ</p>\n<p>Addressing Gifford, Bush Hager said, âYou have been such a role model and so generous with your time . . . You are beloved here in so many ways, and if I can use some of your grace and have a half of what youâve done, my life will be a very happy one.â</p>\n<p>Gifford announced her impending departure in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/kathie-lee-gifford-leaving-today-show\">December</a>, tearfully telling the <em>Today</em> audience, âIâve been in this business 120 years, and never worked with a more beautiful group of people who just give, give, give every day. . . . We have fun and we laugh and we support one another. We know each otherâs kidsâ names, and we know when someoneâs having a colonoscopy. We know everything. And we do life together.â</p>\n<p>Bush Hager joined <em>Today</em> in 2009, and has subbed in for both Kotb and Gifford multiple times. She has also brought in several high-profile interviews&#8212;including multiple with members of her own family. In an e-mail to NBC staffers, news chief <strong>Noah Oppenheim</strong> wrote that Bush Hagerâs âcompassion and curiosity come through in all of her stories, along with her Texas-sized sense of humor. . . . While itâs bittersweet to say goodbye to Kathie Lee, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to make some changes at 10 a.m.â</p>\n<p>Giffordâs last day on <em>Today</em> will be <a

The trouble started a year ago, in the fall of 2017. The #MeToo movement had recently begun. Nicole Silverberg, currently a writer on <em>Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</em>, had shared on her Facebook page a trove of bilious comments directed at her after she&#x2019;d written a list of ways men &#x201C;need to do better.&#x201D; In the comments section beneath her post, another comic, Marcia Belsky, wrote, &#x201C;Men are scum.&#x201D; Facebook kicked Belsky off the platform for 30 days.</p><!-- react-empty: 233 --><p data-reactid="234">This seemed absurd. First of all, the news at the time was dominated by stories of men acting scummily. Second, Facebook had been leaving up plenty of well-documented crap. By then the company was deep into an extended cycle of bad press over the toxic, fraudulent, and/or covertly Russian content that had polluted its platform throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. In Western Europe, the far right was using the site to vilify Middle Eastern migrants. In Southeast Asia, authoritarian regimes were using it to dial up anger against religious minorities and political enemies. But Facebook was taking down &#x201C;men are scum&#x201D;?</p><!-- react-empty: 235 --><!-- react-empty: 236 --><p data-reactid="237">Belsky hopped on a 500-person (Facebook) group of female comics. A bunch of them were getting banned for similar infractions, even as they reported sexist invective being hurled their way. They decided to protest by spamming the platform. On November 24, dozens of &#x201C;men are scum&#x201D; posts went up. And then &#x2026; they came right down. Belsky was put back in Facebook jail. The women of Men Are Scum became a brief Internet cause c&#xE9;l&#xE8;bre, another data point in the never-ending narrative that <em>Facebook doesn&#x2019;t care about you</em>.</p><div data-reactid="238"><div class="embed block row iframe"><div class="wrapper"><div class="embed iframe-embed-component " data-type="iframe" data-url="https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=likes-hate"><iframe height="100" width="350" src="https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=likes-hate"></iframe></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid="239">Ten months later, the issue hasn&#x2019;t gone away, and Facebook C.E.O. <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/mark-zuckerberg#intcid=dt-hot-link">Mark Zuckerberg</a> has let it be known within the company that he, too, is concerned by the policy. Today&#x2019;s meeting is part of an ongoing attempt to solve the problem. The session takes place in Building 23, which, compared with the glorious Frank Gehry-designed offices on the other side of campus, is small and relatively nondescript. No majestic redwood trees, no High Line-inspired rooftop park. Even its signage&#x2014;inspirational photo illustrations of Elie Wiesel and Malala&#x2014;suggests a more innocent era, when the company&#x2019;s ethos seemed more daftly utopian than sinister. The meeting room is called &#x201C;Oh, Semantics.&#x201D; All the rooms at Facebook have cute names like &#x201C;Atticus Finch&#x201D; or &#x201C;Marble Rye,&#x201D; after the <em>Seinfeld</em> episode. Mostly they seem random, but this one feels apt, because Oh, Semantics is where the company&#x2019;s shadow government has been meeting, every two weeks, to debate what you can and cannot post on Facebook.</p><p data-reactid="240">No company&#x2019;s image and reputation are as strongly linked to its C.E.O. as Facebook&#x2019;s. (Who in the general population can name the chief executive of Google? Of Walmart?) This is partly because the C.E.O. invented the company. It&#x2019;s partly because his image as smart-ass founder was immortalized in a successful Hollywood movie. And it&#x2019;s partly because he&#x2019;s young and awkward and seems to make mistakes all the time. As a result, people tend to judge Facebook through the prism of Mark Zuckerberg&#x2019;s gaffes and missteps. Call it the not-so-great-man theory of history.</p><p data-reactid="241">But when it comes to figuring out how Facebook actually works&#x2014;how it decides what content is allowed, and what isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;the most important person in the company isn&#x2019;t Mark Zuckerberg. It&#x2019;s Monika Bickert, a former federal prosecutor and Harvard Law School graduate. At 42, Bickert is currently one of only a handful of people, along with her counterparts at Google, with real power to dictate free-speech norms for the entire world. In Oh, Semantics, she sits at the head of a long table, joined by several dozen deputies in their 30s and 40s. Among them are engineers, lawyers, and P.R. people. But mostly they are policymakers, the people who write Facebook&#x2019;s laws. Like Bickert, a number are veterans of the public sector, Obama-administration refugees eager to maintain some semblance of the pragmatism that has lost favor in Washington.</p><p data-reactid="242">Tall and thin, with long strawberry-blond hair, Bickert sits behind a laptop decorated with a TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES sticker. She speaks neither in guarded corporatese nor in the faux-altruistic argot particular to Silicon Valley. As a relative newcomer to the tech industry, she regards Facebook with the ambivalence of a normal person, telling me she&#x2019;s relieved her two teenage daughters are &#x201C;not all about sharing everything&#x201D; on social media. When I cite Facebook&#x2019;s stated mission to make the world a &#x201C;more open and connected place,&#x201D; she literally rolls her eyes. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a company. It&#x2019;s a business,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Like, I am not, I guess, apologetic about the reality that we have to answer to advertisers or the public or regulators.&#x201D; To her, Facebook is neither utopian nor dystopian. It&#x2019;s just massively influential and, for the moment, not going anywhere.</p><p data-reactid="243">In the wake of the 2016 election, Zuckerberg embarked on a ludicrous nationwide listening tour. While he was feeding calves in Wisconsin, Bickert and her team began methodically re-writing many of the policies that had fueled the world&#x2019;s anti-Facebook animus. Last fall, Facebook agreed to show me exactly how they did it. I was granted unrestricted access to closed-door meetings like the one in Oh, Semantics, permitted to review internal deliberations on the company&#x2019;s Slack-like messaging system, and provided with slide decks and Excel spreadsheets that lay out the minutiae of the new policies.</p><p data-reactid="244">The topics discussed in Bickert&#x2019;s policy meetings are almost always bummers. Today&#x2019;s agenda: terrorism, non-sexual adult nudity, editing disturbing content on the pages of dead people, and, finally, &#x201C;men are scum.&#x201D; The issue is introduced by Mary deBree, who worked in Obama&#x2019;s State Department. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t want to silence people when they&#x2019;re trying to raise awareness around&#x2014;for example&#x2014;sexual assault,&#x201D; she begins. However. &#x201C;However, um, the tension in this is that, if we allow more attacks on the basis of gender, this may also lead to more misogynistic content on the platform.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="245">Hence the dilemma.</p><p data-reactid="246">When Facebook mass-deletes &#x201C;men are scum,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s not thanks to top-down bias at the company, or some rogue men&#x2019;s-rights Facebooker taking his stand against misandry. Nor is it a boneheaded &#x201C;enforcement error&#x201D; caused by one of Facebook&#x2019;s 15,000 human content moderators around the world. The posts get removed because of one of Monika Bickert&#x2019;s well-intentioned, though possibly doomed, policies.</p><div data-reactid="247"><div class="embed image row"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="pinterest-link-container"><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c756e2c52ce6720b3607d52/master/w_690,c_limit/facebook-march-2019-02.jpg" alt=" Andy O&#x2019;Connell standing at this desk." title data-pin-desc="SOLVING FOR HATE

They&#x2019;re called Community Standards, and they were made public in full for the first time in April 2018. One of them is hate speech, which Facebook defines as an &#x201C;attack&#x201D; against a &#x201C;protected characteristic,&#x201D; such as gender, sexuality, race, or religion. And one of the most serious ways to attack someone, Facebook has decided, is to compare them to something dehumanizing.</p><p data-reactid="250">Like: <em>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically inferior</em>.</p><p data-reactid="251">Or: <em>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces</em>.</p><p data-reactid="252">That means statements like &#x201C;black people are monkeys&#x201D; and &#x201C;Koreans are the scum of the earth&#x201D; are subject to removal. But then, so is &#x201C;men are trash.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="253">See the problem? If you remove dehumanizing attacks against gender, you may block speech designed to draw attention to a social movement like #MeToo. If you allow dehumanizing attacks against gender, well, you&#x2019;re allowing dehumanizing attacks against gender. And if you do that, how do you defend other &#x201C;protected&#x201D; groups from similar attacks?</p><p data-reactid="254">DeBree and one of her colleagues, a China expert named David Caragliano, float a handful of fixes. Idea one: punish attacks against gender less harshly than, say, attacks against race. &#x201C;Men are scum&#x201D; would stay up. But so would &#x201C;women are scum.&#x201D; This doesn&#x2019;t seem quite right.</p><p data-reactid="255">Another idea is to treat the genders themselves differently. Caragliano cues up a slide deck. On it is a graph showing internal research that Facebook users are more upset by attacks against women than they are by attacks against men. Women would be protected against all hate speech, while men would be protected only against explicit calls for violence. &#x201C;Women are scum&#x201D; would be removed. &#x201C;Men are scum&#x201D; could stay.</p><p data-reactid="256">Problem solved? Well &#x2026; not quite. Bickert foresees another hurdle. &#x201C;My instinct is not to treat the genders differently,&#x201D; she tells me. &#x201C;We live in a world where we now acknowledge there are many genders, not just men and women. I suspect the attacks you see are disproportionately against those genders and women, but not men.&#x201D; If you create a policy based on that logic, though, &#x201C;you end up in this space where it&#x2019;s like, &#x2018;Our hate-speech policy applies to everybody&#x2014;except for men.&#x2019; &#x201D; Imagine how that would play.</p><div data-reactid="257"><div class="callout large has-pullquote" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote>

In truth, &#x201C;men are scum&#x201D; is a well-known and much-debated topic in Menlo Park, with improbably large implications for the governing philosophy of the platform and, thus, the Internet. For philosophical and financial reasons, Facebook was established with one set of universally shared values. And in order to facilitate as much &#x201C;sharing&#x201D; as possible, no one group or individual would be treated differently from another. If you couldn&#x2019;t call women &#x201C;scum,&#x201D; then you couldn&#x2019;t call men &#x201C;scum,&#x201D; either.</p><p data-reactid="259">If you take a step back, it&#x2019;s kind of an idealistic way to think about the world. It&#x2019;s also a classically Western, liberal way to think about the world. Give everyone an equal shot at free expression, and democracy and liberty will naturally flourish. Unfortunately, the more Facebook grows, the less democracy and liberty seem to be flourishing. Likewise, the more permissive Facebook&#x2019;s platform, the more prone it is to be corrupted by trolls, bots, fake news, propaganda, and bigotry. Yet the more Facebook cracks down on that stuff, the more it looks like the company&#x2019;s premise was compromised from the start.</p><p data-reactid="260">That&#x2019;s the problem with running a shadow government that seeks to regulate the speech of 2.3 billion people. Governing, by its nature, demands trade-offs. But much of the world right now is not in the mood for trade-offs. People gravitate to Facebook, in part, to live in cocoons of their own making. If Facebook has created a parallel online society for a quarter of the world to live in, the question facing Monika Bickert and her team is: What kind of society is it going to be?</p><p data-reactid="261"><strong>In the beginning</strong> there was no shadow government at Facebook. There was just Dave. Dave Willner, Facebook&#x2019;s very first rulemaker. When Willner arrived at the company, in 2008, Facebook had about 145 million monthly users. Prior to his arrival, the people deciding what was allowed on the platform were also the people answering customer-service e-mails. Mostly, users complained that they wanted embarrassing party pics taken down. The company&#x2019;s policy was essentially to take down &#x201C;Hitler and naked people&#x201D; plus &#x201C;anything else that makes you feel uncomfortable.&#x201D; Willner started clicking through 15,000 photos a day, removing things that made him uncomfortable.</p><p data-reactid="262">That wasn&#x2019;t ideal. So Willner wrote Facebook&#x2019;s first constitution, a set of laws called Community Standards. He and his small brain trust generally adhered to John Stuart Mill&#x2019;s seminal principle that speech should be banned only if used to stoke violence against others. This hands-off philosophy also aligned with Facebook&#x2019;s self-interest. More speech equals more users, and more users equals more ad revenue. Plus, by positioning itself as an open &#x201C;platform&#x201D; rather than a publisher, Facebook could not be sued for libel, like a newspaper could. False information would stay up. Only obviously toxic content like terrorist propaganda, bullying, and graphic violence&#x2014;plus criminal activity, like child pornography and drug trafficking&#x2014;would come down. As would hate speech.</p><p data-reactid="263">By 2013, when Willner left Facebook, the company&#x2019;s user base had grown nearly tenfold, to 1.2 billion. The company, which was expanding to include the purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram, had gotten way too big for Community Standards 1.0. That year, Bickert took over as Facebook&#x2019;s content czar. A native of Southern California, Bickert spent the first phase of her career at the Justice Department in Chicago, prosecuting gang violence and public corruption. She spent the second phase at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, where she extradited child sex traffickers. While her primary focus was protecting kids, she also began to think more about freedom of speech, thanks to strict laws against criticizing the Thai monarchy. She was, in other words, already weighing versions of the fundamental tension&#x2014;&#x201C;safety&#x201D; vs. &#x201C;voice&#x201D;&#x2014;that undergirds all of Facebook&#x2019;s policy decisions.</p><p data-reactid="264">When Bickert started the job, Facebook was in panic mode. The Boston Marathon bombing had just occurred, and moderators were flagging photojournalism as graphic violence. Images of blown-off limbs, which clearly violated the policy, were being removed. And yet they were clearly newsworthy. The images were ultimately restored.</p><p data-reactid="265">A month later, the opposite problem. The Internet began protesting violent rape jokes that <em>weren&#x2019;t</em> being yanked from the platform. Facebook explained that its policies allowed for toxic speech that didn&#x2019;t seem likely to provoke physical harm. But after several companies pulled their ads, Facebook took down the jokes and pledged to re-write its policies. What had started as an anodyne platform for people to share photos and random musings was now a media giant that an increasing share of the world relied on for news. It wasn&#x2019;t so obvious anymore what content was or wasn&#x2019;t inappropriate.</p><p data-reactid="266">The differences between policing the real world and policing the Internet became manifest. &#x201C;The level of context you have when you&#x2019;re looking at criminal laws&#x2014;there&#x2019;s fact-finding, you provide evidence on both sides, you actually look at the problem in a 360-degree way,&#x201D; Bickert says. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t. We have a snippet of something online. We don&#x2019;t know who&#x2019;s behind this. Or what they&#x2019;re like. So it&#x2019;s a system at maximum scale with very imperfect information.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="267">Bickert started building out the policy team in her own image. Though she is trained as a litigator, her engaging manner and easy intellect are more redolent of a law professor. On Facebook&#x2019;s campus, she hired a high-school teacher, a rape crisis counselor, a West Point counterterrorism expert, a Defense Department researcher. &#x201C;I was hiring people who weren&#x2019;t coming here because they cared about Facebook necessarily,&#x201D; she says, but because they believed they could exert more influence in Menlo Park than in academia or gridlocked Washington.</p><p data-reactid="268">By 2015, Bickert had teamed up with two other Facebook executives, Ellen Silver and Guy Rosen, to police bad content in a more targeted way. Bickert would set the policies. Silver would work with content moderators to implement them. And Rosen would build proactive detection tools to get in front of them. They called themselves &#x201C;the three-sided coin.&#x201D; (Leave it to Facebook to name its governing structure after money.)</p><p data-reactid="269">Thanks to Rosen&#x2019;s efforts, the company got masterful at eradicating porn and terrorist propaganda, which were fairly easy for artificial intelligence to classify. The rest of the hard-to-look-at stuff&#x2014;violent threats, sexual solicitation and trafficking, images of self-harm and suicide, harassment, doxing, and hate speech&#x2014;was largely up to humans to catch. First, individual Facebook users had to flag content they didn&#x2019;t like. Then Facebook&#x2019;s moderators, working across three continents, would consult manuals prepared by Silver&#x2019;s team to see if it actually violated any of Bickert&#x2019;s policies.</p><p data-reactid="270">After the 2016 election, however, this system began to feel inadequate to the enormity of the task. When I ask Bickert the biggest difference in her job now versus five years ago, she replies without hesitation. &#x201C;Social climate,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Immigration into Europe. Ethnic tension. Sharply contested elections. The rise of hot speech.&#x201D; Meanwhile, problems no one had anticipated, like fake news and misinformation, had also announced themselves on the platform. And that was all before the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook was revealed to have turned over the personal information of tens of millions of users to a Trump-linked political consultancy.</p><p data-reactid="271">Facebook&#x2019;s reputation tanked. Many Silicon Valley elders, including some of the company&#x2019;s early backers, went full apostate and denounced the platform. Zuckerberg wrote a 5,700-word <em>mea culpa</em> in which he conceded that the company may have had a negative impact on our &#x201C;social infrastructure.&#x201D; A bleak consensus emerged. To make money, observed former Slate editor Jacob Weisberg, Facebook had addicted us and sold our eyeballs to advertisers. In return, it made us &#x201C;selfish, disagreeable, and lonely, while corroding democracy, truth, and economic equality.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="272">In the midst of all the bad press, in 2017, ProPublica dropped a bombshell report that directly impugned the company&#x2019;s Community Standards. Sifting through troves of leaked content-moderation manuals, ProPublica discovered a number of strange and seemingly inexplicable policies. The most alarming: &#x201C;white men&#x201D; were protected by the company&#x2019;s hate-speech laws, while &#x201C;black children&#x201D; were not. After a year of damning headlines about Facebook, media coverage of the policy presumed the worst about the company&#x2019;s motivations.</p><p data-reactid="273">Bickert decided she needed to re-write Facebook&#x2019;s hate-speech laws. Four years into her job, here was her moment to see if she could, in her own way, redeem the company. By fixing the problems the original &#x201C;move fast and break things&#x201D; generation didn&#x2019;t foresee&#x2014;or created in the first place&#x2014;maybe Facebook&#x2019;s hidden legislative body could finally make the world a better place.</p><div data-reactid="274"><div class="embed image row"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="pinterest-link-container"><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c756e30f926b42d6190f869/master/w_690,c_limit/facebook-march-2019-04.jpg" alt="Facebook headquarters with policy managers." title data-pin-desc="Bickert, with policy managers Gaurav Upot, Mary deBree, and David Caragliano.

</span><div class="credits">Photograph by Balazs Gardi.</div></div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid="275"><strong>It&#x2019;s a clich&#xE9;</strong> of Silicon Valley that tech campuses are stocked with infantilizing perks and free food. The conventional wisdom is that these things keep employees from ever leaving the premises. Another reason becomes clear when you visit Facebook: there is absolutely nothing to do within a five-mile radius of campus. Step outside One Hacker Way, in Menlo Park, and you are met with highway on one side and pungent, marshy salt ponds on the other. The whole area feels strip-mined of natural beauty. All of which makes it both obscene and highly pleasant to sit in the shade of the redwood trees that were dug up and hauled to a woodsy outdoor gathering space on the grounds of Building 21. Facebook&#x2019;s campus exists, in other words, as a physical manifestation of its business model: a privatization of the public square. And that hybrid status raises novel questions about how an individual company can&#x2014;or should&#x2014;regulate the speech of billions.</p><p data-reactid="276">Of all the prohibited content on the platform, hate speech is by far the hardest to adjudicate. First, there isn&#x2019;t an obvious way to define it. In the U.S., there&#x2019;s no legal category for hate speech; in Europe, it&#x2019;s delineated pretty specifically. Second, because people post hateful stuff for all kinds of personal and idiosyncratic reasons, there isn&#x2019;t a systemic way to disincentivize it. To understand how Facebook polices hate speech is to understand how Facebook&#x2019;s brain works.</p><p data-reactid="277">I head to a small, pod-like room in Building 23 to meet with the two lead ar&#xAD;chitects of the hate-speech revamp: Gaurav Upot, a seven-year veteran of the company, and David Caragliano, of the &#x201C;men are scum&#x201D; powwow. Caragliano begins, pulling up a slide deck. &#x201C;The way I think about this is, we were in the worst of all worlds.&#x201D; In one way, the old hate-speech policy was too narrow. The way it was written, you couldn&#x2019;t say you wanted to &#x201C;kill&#x201D; a member of a protected group, like a Catholic or a Latina. But you could say you wanted to kill Catholic <em>theologians</em> or Latina <em>actresses</em>. The thinking was, if you&#x2019;re being that specific, you&#x2019;re almost certainly exaggerating, or joking, or maybe just upset about a crummy movie. The problem was that age, like &#x201C;theologians&#x201D; or &#x201C;actresses,&#x201D; wasn&#x2019;t classified as a protected category. That&#x2019;s how attacks on &#x201C;black children&#x201D; slipped through the net, while hating on &#x201C;white men&#x201D; was banned.</p><p data-reactid="278">In a different way, the policy was also too broad. In 2017, a lot of L.G.B.T.Q. people were posting the word &#x201C;dyke&#x201D; on Facebook. That was deemed a slur, and was duly removed. A blind spot was exposed. Facebook, it has been observed, is able to judge content&#x2014;but not intent. Matt Katsaros, a Facebook researcher who worked extensively on hate speech, cites an unexpected problem with flagging slurs. &#x201C;The policy had drawn a distinction between &#x2018;nigger&#x2019; and &#x2018;nigga,&#x2019; &#x201D; he explains. The first was banned, the second was allowed. Makes sense. &#x201C;But then we found that in Africa many use &#x2018;nigger&#x2019; the same way people in America use &#x2018;nigga.&#x2019; &#x201D; Back to the drawing board.</p><p data-reactid="279">Caragliano and Upot began writing a granular policy meant to solve both these problems. A matrix of hate-speech laws from across the European Union that Caragliano prepared highlights the complexity of their endeavor&#x2014;and a tacit admission that Facebook&#x2019;s global standards aren&#x2019;t really feasible in practice. On the y-axis of the chart are a number of hypothetical hate-speech examples. On the x-axis are various E.U. nations&#x2019; tolerance of the speech. So, for example, &#x201C;Muslims are criminals&#x201D; is clearly illegal in Belgium and France, likely legal in Denmark and Italy, and likely illegal in England and Germany. (And banned by Facebook.)</p><p data-reactid="280">Caragliano and Upot pulled input from seven Facebook departments and more than 30 academics, NGOs, and activist groups. It took them four months to finish an initial revise of the policy. When they finished, in October 2017, it looked like this: Attacks would be divided into three categories of severity. The first included calls to violence (&#x201C;kill&#x201D;), dehumanizing words (&#x201C;scum&#x201D;), and offensive visual stereotypes (depicting a Jewish person as a rat). The second included &#x201C;statements of inferiority.&#x201D; The third encompassed &#x201C;calls for exclusion.&#x201D; Slurs, meanwhile, would be quarantined in their own context-dependent mini-category.</p><p data-reactid="281">The revamp allowed Facebook to target problematic speech more specifically. Guy Rosen&#x2019;s team, for example, trained its automatic detection classifier to seek only the most severe tier of hate speech. Since then, Facebook has gone from flagging about a quarter of all hate speech before users do, to more than half, without accidentally removing proud uses of &#x201C;dyke.&#x201D; The new rules also enabled Facebook to better classify overlooked categories like &#x201C;Catholic theologians&#x201D; or &#x201C;black children,&#x201D; who were now protected from hateful attacks.</p><p data-reactid="282">Here&#x2019;s how it works in practice: late last year, Facebook removed several posts by Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israel&#x2019;s prime minister. Netanyahu had called Palestinians &#x201C;monsters&#x201D; and advocated that &#x201C;all the Muslims leave the land of Israel.&#x201D; Palestinians and Muslims are both protected groups. &#x201C;Monster&#x201D; is dehumanizing, &#x201C;leave&#x201D; is a call for exclusion, and both are classified as hate speech. The removal was consistent with the new policy. In response, Netanyahu called Facebook &#x201C;the thought police.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="283">All these changes, though, were happening in private. Last September, when Facebook C.O.O. Sheryl Sandberg testified before Congress about the threat of foreign interference in the upcoming midterm elections, Senator Kamala Harris took the occasion to grill her about the &#x201C;black children&#x201D; incident. Sandberg responded with a canned and confusing answer that reinforced the wide perception that Facebook is full of crap. &#x201C;We care tremendously about civil rights,&#x201D; Sandberg said. &#x201C;We have worked closely with civil-rights groups to find hate speech on our platform and take it down.&#x201D; Harris asked her to specify when the problematic policy had been changed. Sandberg couldn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p data-reactid="284">If Bickert was watching back in Menlo Park, she must have been beside herself. The &#x201C;black children&#x201D; loophole, which was at its root an operational issue, had been closed more than a year earlier. The gap between the competence of the policy wonks who write Facebook&#x2019;s rules, and the high-profile executives who defend them in public, could hardly have seemed wider.</p><p data-reactid="285"><strong>Not long after</strong> Sandberg&#x2019;s testimony, at a diner in Palo Alto, I ask Bickert who her John Stuart Mill is. Louis Brandeis, she tells me, the former Supreme Court justice who helped enshrine free speech as a bedrock of 20th-century American democracy. &#x201C;The Brandeis idea that you need people to be able to have the conversation, that that&#x2019;s how they learn, that that&#x2019;s how we develop an informed society that can govern itself&#x2014;that matters, I think.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="286">In general, Bickert would rather not censor content that&#x2019;s part of the national discourse, even when it&#x2019;s blatantly hateful. A prime example: in 2017, just before Facebook began re-writing its hate-speech policies, U.S. representative Clay Higgins of Louisiana posted a message on his Facebook wall demanding that all &#x201C;radicalized Islamic suspects&#x201D; be executed. &#x201C;Hunt them, identify them, and kill them,&#x201D; he wrote. &#x201C;Kill them all.&#x201D; People were obviously outraged. But Facebook left the message up, as it didn&#x2019;t violate the company&#x2019;s hate-speech rules. (&#x201C;Radicalized Islamic suspects&#x201D; wasn&#x2019;t a protected category.) Post-revamp, that outburst would run afoul of the Community Standards. Yet Facebook has not taken the message down, citing an exemption for &#x201C;newsworthy&#x201D; content. &#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t you want to be able to discuss that?&#x201D; Bickert asks, when I point to Higgins&#x2019;s post. &#x201C;We really do want to give people room to share their political views, even when they are distasteful.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="287">Bickert is articulating not just the classic Facebookian position that <em>sharing is good,</em> but also what used to be a fairly uncontroversial idea, protected by the First Amendment, that a democratic society functions best when people have the right to say what they want, no matter how offensive. This Brandeisian principle, she fears, is eroding. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s scary,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;When they talk to people on U.S. college campuses and ask how important freedom of speech is to you, something like 60 percent say it&#x2019;s not important at all. The outrage about Facebook tends to push in the direction of taking down more speech. Fewer groups are willing to stand up for unpopular speech.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="288">Increasingly, real-world events are testing whether Facebook can cling to a vision of liberalism in which one set of laws applies to everyone, or whether it needs to transition to a social-justice-minded model in which certain groups warrant more protection than others. In the wake of the Syrian-refugee crisis, for instance, negative comments about Muslim migrants began flooding Facebook pages in Europe. Some advocated for tight borders. Some were straight-up racist. The goal, as Bickert saw it, was to find a middle ground, to avoid painting charged political speech with the same brush as legitimate hate speech. In 2016, Facebook devised a fix. Immigrants would be &#x201C;quasi-protected.&#x201D; You couldn&#x2019;t call them &#x201C;scum,&#x201D; but you could call for their exclusion from a country. Facebook was starting to draw lines it had never before drawn.</p><p data-reactid="289">When the &#x201C;men are scum&#x201D; problem first landed on its radar, in late 2017, Facebook began to consider an even more radical step. Should some groups be protected more than others? Women more than men, say, or gay people more than straight people? &#x201C;People recognize power dynamics and feel like we are tone-deaf not to address them,&#x201D; Caragliano says. After the policy meeting in Oh, Semantics last fall, Caragliano and deBree spun off four separate working groups to devise a fix for &#x201C;men are scum.&#x201D; Over the course of the next four months, they studied 6,800 examples of gendered hate speech that had appeared on the platform. It was easy, deBree said, to find reasons to defend a statement like &#x201C;men are disgusting.&#x201D; But it felt wrong to let users say &#x201C;gay men are disgusting&#x201D; or &#x201C;Chinese men are disgusting.&#x201D; In the end, in late January of this year, Facebook arrived at a deflating consensus: nothing would change.</p><p data-reactid="290">In the abstract, almost everyone on Bickert&#x2019;s team favored a hate-speech policy that took into account power imbalances between different groups. But for a user base of more than two billion people, such changes proved impossible to scale. On some level, there are no &#x201C;fixes&#x201D; to Facebook&#x2019;s problems. There are only trade-offs. Like an actual government, it seemed, the best Facebook could hope for was a bunch of half-decent compromises. And like a government, anything it did would still piss off at least half its constituents.</p><p data-reactid="291"><strong>There is a</strong> wide assumption, not unfounded, that Facebook has a financial stake in leaving total garbage up on its site. Reams of evidence, anecdotal and scholarly, suggest that its News Feed algorithm rewards inflammatory and addictive content. Even as the company has vowed over the past year to prioritize &#x201C;local,&#x201D; &#x201C;meaningful,&#x201D; and &#x201C;informative&#x201D; content, a shameless British clickbait site called LadBible consistently ranks as its top publisher. Unilad.com, which is basically the same thing, is rarely far behind. So are Breitbart, TMZ, and the <em>Daily Mail</em>. Facebook, as <em>Wired</em> editor Nicholas Thompson puts it, feeds us Cheetos rather than kale.</p><p data-reactid="292">The problem with eradicating this sort of junk food is that the News Feed rewards stuff that people click on. Paternalistically replace it with high-minded content, and you&#x2019;ll lose customers. Writing in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times Magazine</em> a couple years ago, Farhad Manjoo implied that Facebook, other than making money off clicks, didn&#x2019;t really have a policy agenda at all. &#x201C;The people who work on News Feed aren&#x2019;t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition, or seniority,&#x201D; he wrote. &#x201C;The News Feed team&#x2019;s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want [and] to give them more of that.&#x201D; And what people want, evidently, is Cheetos.</p><p data-reactid="293">But hate speech, fascinatingly, doesn&#x2019;t work like this. If you give Facebook users too much of it, they actually do go away. On one of my visits to Facebook, I go out to dinner with Matt Katsaros, the hate-speech researcher. He lives in San Francisco&#x2019;s Outer Sunset, which sits on the lip of the Pacific, and is one of the last neighborhoods in the city not yet spoiled by tech zillionaires. The sleepiness of the place suits Katsaros, a 30-year-old who in his spare time works as a textile artist.</p><p data-reactid="294">Having spent the last several years staring at hate speech on the Internet, Katsaros is probably one of the world&#x2019;s experts on disturbing social-media content. (&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a lot of women being compared to kitchen appliances right now,&#x201D; he tells me.) The emotional toll of his job has significantly decreased his own appetite for ever posting anything on Facebook. &#x201C;I spend my day talking to people who say, &#x2018;Oh, they took a picture of me and wrote <em>faggot</em> on top of it.&#x2019; &#x201D; That, he says, is exactly why the company has a strong interest in eradicating hate speech. Some amount of inflammatory speech revs people up. But crank the ugliness dial too far, the research shows, and people withdraw. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no incentive for us to have that stuff,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;People get silenced, they don&#x2019;t engage, and then they go off to do something else.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="295">Bickert makes a similar argument. &#x201C;People will say, &#x2018;Oh, your business interests are not aligned with the safety interests of the community.&#x2019; I completely disagree with that,&#x201D; she says. Not only does hate speech turn others off, but the people who post it may not be ideal moneymakers for the company. &#x201C;Those people are not likely to click on an ad for shoes, you know, in the middle of their hate. The person who is looking at puppy videos is a lot more likely.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="296">Last year, Facebook finally started posting metrics about how much banned content it was taking down from the site. It&#x2019;s impossible to know exactly how much of the bad stuff they&#x2019;re removing, since many users don&#x2019;t report toxic content in the first place. (This is one reason it can be difficult to identify hate speech against persecuted minorities around the world: many users don&#x2019;t consider it hate speech at all.) Still, the numbers are encouraging. From October to December of 2017, Facebook purged about 1.6 million pieces of hate speech. From July to September of 2018, that number spiked to 2.9 million, or some 30,000 pieces a day.</p><p data-reactid="297">Facebook presumably wouldn&#x2019;t be doing all this if it were actually invested in keeping its user base frothing at the mouth. Indeed, compared with early, failed social-media platforms like MySpace, Facebook is highly regulated. At the same time, it&#x2019;s disturbing that the platform hosts so much toxicity in the first place. Bickert&#x2019;s theory is that Facebook has gotten so big it&#x2019;s come to mirror the ugliness of the rest of the world. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not crazy about the level of discourse that I see online in general,&#x201D; she concedes. At the same time, she resists laying all of that at the feet of Facebook&#x2019;s filter bubbles. &#x201C;Since the early 70s, when you measure people based on their sentiments towards opposing political parties, it&#x2019;s been kind of going up like this&#x201D;&#x2014;her hands fly upward and outward. &#x201C;So to the extent that that&#x2019;s a lot of the garbage that&#x2019;s on social media, that&#x2019;s reflecting what&#x2019;s in society.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="298">Maybe Bickert has a point. But there&#x2019;s also a case to be made that Facebook, in trying to eradicate bad content, is locked in an unwinnable war with the world it helped create. After hastening the demise of the traditional news media by siphoning off much of its advertising revenue, then handing its platform over to whichever bottom-feeding blogs, shitposters, and fake-news profiteers could generate the most user outrage&#x2014;well, of course, there&#x2019;s plenty of toxic speech for the company to remove. And while in the real world&#x2014;or even on more rudimentary social-media platforms like Reddit&#x2014;the power of robust counter-speech can do a lot to push back against noxious commentary, on Facebook, like-minded users are herded together by the self-sorting News Feed algorithm.</p><p data-reactid="299">I float the argument to Katsaros that, at least in the short term, the company&#x2019;s financial incentives <em>are</em> misaligned. One way to beat back the trash on its platform would be to plow its profits into building active detection tools and hiring more content moderators. Facebook, for example, has just four full-time fact checkers in Nigeria, a country of 200 million.</p><p data-reactid="300">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t that happen?&#x201D; Katsaros asks. &#x201C;The stock price took a huge hit.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="301">He&#x2019;s right. It did. Last summer, after Facebook said it would invest in expanding its safety net, investors revolted. Which suggests &#x2026;</p><p data-reactid="302">&#x201C;Are you just saying that, like, capitalism is bad?&#x201D; Katsaros asks. &#x201C;Is that what you&#x2019;re getting at?&#x201D; He stares at me deadpan for a couple seconds, before a gallows-humor smile spreads across his face. &#x201C;Yeah. Definitely.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="303">Next time I checked in with Katsaros, he had quit the company.</p><p data-reactid="304"><strong>If Facebook</strong> has a commander in chief (Zuckerberg) and a legislative body (Bickert&#x2019;s team), it recently decided to add a third branch of government. In November, Zuckerberg wrote a post signaling his commitment to establishing an external, independent board with the power to evaluate and override the company&#x2019;s most controversial decisions. In other words, Facebook would create a Supreme Court.</p><p data-reactid="305">The idea seemed gauzy and abstract&#x2014;a Zuckerberg specialty. In fact, two people at Facebook have been planning the Supreme Court for more than a year. Andy O&#x2019;Connell came to Facebook from the State Department, and Heather Moore joined from the Justice Department. Both work under Monika Bickert. O&#x2019;Connell explains Zuckerberg&#x2019;s motivation. &#x201C;His strong view is that all the content issues are issues for the community&#x2014;that they are not motivated by business interests,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;But nobody believes that, of course.&#x201D; The court would improve not just Facebook&#x2019;s decision-making but also the &#x201C;perception of legitimacy.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="306">The task was daunting. Nobody has ever built a judicial system for a constituency of 2.3 billion people before. How many cases would it hear? Where would the judges come from? Would they be paid? Who pays them? Do deliberations take place over patchy Skype sessions? In a gargantuan mega-chamber, like the one used by the senate in the awful <em>Star Wars</em> prequels?</p><p data-reactid="307">As we discuss the idea in Building 23, O&#x2019;Connell starts off by narrowing the court&#x2019;s jurisdiction. &#x201C;The way I&#x2019;m thinking about it,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s either really hard calls&#x2014;things of significant public interest&#x2014;or places where a novel case could cause us to reconsider a long-established policy.&#x201D; That, in turn, leads to questions about how to choose the cases. Does Facebook pick? Do you let the public decide? &#x201C;Then you get into all the, like, Boaty McBoatface public voting problems&#x201D;&#x2014;the unfortunate name Twitter users selected for a British research vessel.</p><p data-reactid="308">Moore chimes in. &#x201C;And then, should that be a public decision, the way the U.S. Supreme Court makes a public decision?&#x201D; Only about 4 percent of Facebook&#x2019;s content is news. The rest is personal. So imagine a case involving bullying, or revenge porn. What implications would that have for the privacy of the users involved? Whether you find it heartening or terrifying that Facebook is happily working to improve its shadow government while the sclerotic real-world version in Washington does nothing, there is something thrilling about witnessing a society being built in real time.</p><p data-reactid="309">The week we meet, in late October, O&#x2019;Connell and Moore decide to test-drive an early iteration of the court featuring a couple dozen &#x201C;judges&#x201D; flown in from around the world, with backgrounds in human rights, privacy, and journalism. The session takes place in an airy conference room on a relatively secluded part of campus. The case I sit in on involves a piece of inflammatory content posted in Myanmar, where Facebook has been widely blamed for abetting the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims, by failing to remove attacks against them. While Facebook won&#x2019;t allow me to report on the specifics of the case, I can say that the question before the judges is this: should the court overturn Facebook&#x2019;s decision not to remove the offending content, which did not technically violate the company&#x2019;s hate-speech rules?</p><p data-reactid="310">The judges break off into small panels to debate the case. As Facebook staffers introduce contextual wrinkles that make the case harder to decide, the judges struggle to weigh two of Facebook&#x2019;s own stated principles. Should the platform defend the &#x201C;voice&#x201D; of an anti-Rohingya post? Or should it protect the &#x201C;safety&#x201D; of those who were threatened by it?</p><p data-reactid="311">When the judges come together to issue a ruling, the vote is six to two to take the post down. Facebook&#x2019;s decision, in the abstract, has been overturned. But given the complications of the case, nobody looks particularly satisfied.</p><p data-reactid="312">One of the ironies of Facebook&#x2019;s efforts to clean up its platform is inherent in the framing of the problem. If it&#x2019;s to be a benevolent government, why is it focused almost entirely on policing users? In addition to monitoring and punishing bad behavior, shouldn&#x2019;t it be incentivizing good behavior? In November, Facebook published a study by Matt Katsaros and three academics that sought to answer that question. Currently, when users post nudity or hate speech, they get a brief, automated message informing them of the violation and the removal of their content. Katsaros and his co-authors surveyed nearly 55,000 users who had received the message. Fifty-two percent felt they had not been treated fairly, while 57 percent said it was unlikely that Facebook understood their perspective. But among those who <em>did</em> feel fairly treated, the likelihood of repeat violations subsided.</p><p data-reactid="313">Based on the findings, the paper argued, Facebook should focus less on punishing haters and more on creating a system of procedural justice that users could come to respect and trust. After all, Facebook&#x2019;s government may be a deliberative body, but it&#x2019;s by no means a democratic one. Last year, for the first time, the company began letting users file an appeal when Facebook removed their individual posts. But now Katsaros is gone. So is his co-author Sudhir Venkatesh, who has returned to his sociology post at Columbia University after a two-year stint at Facebook.</p><p data-reactid="314">In late January, Facebook released a few more nuggets about the composition of its Supreme Court. The first iteration would likely feature 40 paid judges, serving on a part-time basis for three-year terms. The court would have the power to overrule Facebook&#x2019;s content moderators, but not to rewrite the company&#x2019;s Community Standards. Little was said about the role or rights of the individual users who would be bringing their appeals to the high court.</p><p data-reactid="315">For now, the court is in Monika Bickert&#x2019;s hands. At the conclusion of the session I attend, Bickert is piped in via video conference. Several judges comment that it would be a lot easier to resolve cases if they understood the motivations behind them. Bickert nods sympathetically. Facebook&#x2019;s Supreme Court will be provided with plenty of context when it decides its cases. But there are only so many appeals it can hear. &#x201C;The reality is, with billions of posts every day, and millions of reports from users every day,&#x201D; Bickert says, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s just not something that we can operationalize at this scale.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="316">It was an outcome that Justice Louis Brandeis, the free-speech advocate, might have predicted. Brandeis was also an outspoken anti-monopolist, and Facebook&#x2019;s critics often invoke him to justify breaking up the company. Even with an independent Supreme Court, it would seem, Facebook may be too big to succeed.</p><p data-reactid="317"><strong>A couple weeks</strong> before the midterm elections, which Facebook is not accused of bungling, Bickert is playing a game. We are walking through a handsome Palo Alto neighborhood called Professorville, adjacent to Zuckerberg&#x2019;s home neighborhood of Crescent Park. It&#x2019;s almost Halloween, and I&#x2019;ve never seen so many extravagantly creepy yard decorations in my life. Home after home, locked in a bourgeois arms race to rack up the most realistically undead ghouls and animatronic skeletons. Accompanying us is Ruchika Budhraja, my Facebook P.R. minder and one of Bickert&#x2019;s close friends at the company. The game is: How much does that house cost?</p><p data-reactid="318">The house we&#x2019;re looking at is enormous: three stories tall, brownish with green trim, plus a wraparound veranda. Bickert appraises. &#x201C;Hmmm,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Nine million.&#x201D; I guess $8.25 million. Budhraja looks up the price on her phone. After a moment, the verdict. &#x201C;It says four and a half,&#x201D; she informs us.</p><p data-reactid="319">What? That can&#x2019;t be right. We&#x2019;re standing in the middle of the most expensive real-estate market in the country. Bickert consults Zillow. &#x201C;This says 12.9.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s more like it. Budhraja pleads no contest. &#x201C;I just googled on the Internet,&#x201D; she says. Bickert shakes her head. &#x201C;Fake news.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="320">This is a chancy parlor game to be playing with a journalist. A tech executive, playfully quantifying how her industry has turned an entire metro area unaffordable. But in the moment, it doesn&#x2019;t feel so tone-deaf. When Bickert marvels at the obscenity of Silicon Valley property values, you can tell it&#x2019;s from a place of anthropological remove. This isn&#x2019;t really her world. She may be at Facebook, but she isn&#x2019;t of it.</p><p data-reactid="321">Because she&#x2019;s not a member of Facebook&#x2019;s founding generation, she&#x2019;s not defensive about the company&#x2019;s shortcomings. And because she&#x2019;s freed from delusions of tech-sector altruism, she isn&#x2019;t precious about trying to make all of Facebook&#x2019;s users happy. If the left wing of the Internet generally wants a safer and more sanitized Facebook, and the right wing wants a free-speech free-for-all, Bickert is clinging to an increasingly outmoded Obamian incrementalism. <em>Lead from behind. Don&#x2019;t do stupid shit</em>. Anything more ambitious would be utopian.</p><p data-reactid="322">&#x201C;The world is too diverse,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;And people see speech so differently, and safety so differently. I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re ever going to craft the perfect set of policies where we&#x2019;re like, &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve nailed it.&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t think we ever will.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="323">And one more thing: You still can&#x2019;t say, &#x201C;Men are scum.&#x201D;</p><h3 data-reactid="324">More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3><p

The trouble started a year ago, in the fall of 2017. The #MeToo movement had recently begun. Nicole Silverberg, currently a writer on <em>Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</em>, had shared on her Facebook page a trove of bilious comments directed at her after she&#x2019;d written a list of ways men &#x201C;need to do better.&#x201D; In the comments section beneath her post, another comic, Marcia Belsky, wrote, &#x201C;Men are scum.&#x201D; Facebook kicked Belsky off the platform for 30 days.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>This seemed absurd.

In Western Europe, the far right was using the site to vilify Middle Eastern migrants.

On November 24, dozens of &#x201C;men are scum&#x201D; posts went up. And then &#x2026; they came right down. Belsky was put back in Facebook jail.

Today&#x2019;s meeting is part of an ongoing attempt to solve the problem. The session takes place in Building 23, which, compared with the glorious Frank Gehry-designed offices on the other side of campus, is small and relatively nondescript. No majestic redwood trees, no High Line-inspired rooftop park. Even its signage&#x2014;inspirational photo illustrations of Elie Wiesel and Malala&#x2014;suggests a more innocent era, when the company&#x2019;s ethos seemed more daftly utopian than sinister. The meeting room is called &#x201C;Oh, Semantics.&#x201D; All the rooms at Facebook have cute names like &#x201C;Atticus Finch&#x201D; or &#x201C;Marble Rye,&#x201D; after the <em>Seinfeld</em> episode.

It&#x2019;s partly because his image as smart-ass founder was immortalized in a successful Hollywood movie. And it&#x2019;s partly because he&#x2019;s young and awkward and seems to make mistakes all the time.

It&#x2019;s Monika Bickert, a former federal prosecutor and Harvard Law School graduate. At 42, Bickert is currently one of only a handful of people, along with her counterparts at Google, with real power to dictate free-speech norms for the entire world. In Oh, Semantics, she sits at the head of a long table, joined by several dozen deputies in their 30s and 40s. Among them are engineers, lawyers, and P.R. people. But mostly they are policymakers, the people who write Facebook&#x2019;s laws.

When I cite Facebook&#x2019;s stated mission to make the world a &#x201C;more open and connected place,&#x201D; she literally rolls her eyes. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a company. It&#x2019;s a business,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Like, I am not, I guess, apologetic about the reality that we have to answer to advertisers or the public or regulators.&#x201D; To her, Facebook is neither utopian nor dystopian. It&#x2019;s just massively influential and, for the moment, not going anywhere.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>In the wake of the 2016 election, Zuckerberg embarked on a ludicrous nationwide listening tour. While he was feeding calves in Wisconsin, Bickert and her team began methodically re-writing many of the policies that had fueled the world&#x2019;s anti-Facebook animus. Last fall, Facebook agreed to show me exactly how they did it. I was granted unrestricted access to closed-door meetings like the one in Oh, Semantics, permitted to review internal deliberations on the company&#x2019;s Slack-like messaging system, and provided with slide decks and Excel spreadsheets that lay out the minutiae of the new policies.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>The topics discussed in Bickert&#x2019;s policy meetings are almost always bummers.

The sleepiness of the place suits Katsaros, a 30-year-old who in his spare time works as a textile artist.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Having spent the last several years staring at hate speech on the Internet, Katsaros is probably one of the world&#x2019;s experts on disturbing social-media content. (&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a lot of women being compared to kitchen appliances right now,&#x201D; he tells me.) The emotional toll of his job has significantly decreased his own appetite for ever posting anything on Facebook. &#x201C;I spend my day talking to people who say, &#x2018;Oh, they took a picture of me and wrote <em>faggot</em> on top of it.&#x2019; &#x201D; That, he says, is exactly why the company has a strong interest in eradicating hate speech. Some amount of inflammatory speech revs people up. But crank the ugliness dial too far, the research shows, and people withdraw. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no incentive for us to have that stuff,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;People get silenced, they don&#x2019;t engage, and then they go off to do something else.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Bickert makes a similar argument. &#x201C;People will say, &#x2018;Oh, your business interests are not aligned with the safety interests of the community.&#x2019; I completely disagree with that,&#x201D; she says. Not only does hate speech turn others off, but the people who post it may not be ideal moneymakers for the company. &#x201C;Those people are not likely to click on an ad for shoes, you know, in the middle of their hate. The person who is looking at puppy videos is a lot more likely.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Last year, Facebook finally started posting metrics about how much banned content it was taking down from the site. It&#x2019;s impossible to know exactly how much of the bad stuff they&#x2019;re removing, since many users don&#x2019;t report toxic content in the first place. (This is one reason it can be difficult to identify hate speech against persecuted minorities around the world: many users don&#x2019;t consider it hate speech at all.) Still, the numbers are encouraging. From October to December of 2017, Facebook purged about 1.6 million pieces of hate speech. From July to September of 2018, that number spiked to 2.9 million, or some 30,000 pieces a day.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Facebook presumably wouldn&#x2019;t be doing all this if it were actually invested in keeping its user base frothing at the mouth. Indeed, compared with early, failed social-media platforms like MySpace, Facebook is highly regulated. At the same time, it&#x2019;s disturbing that the platform hosts so much toxicity in the first place. Bickert&#x2019;s theory is that Facebook has gotten so big it&#x2019;s come to mirror the ugliness of the rest of the world. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not crazy about the level of discourse that I see online in general,&#x201D; she concedes. At the same time, she resists laying all of that at the feet of Facebook&#x2019;s filter bubbles. &#x201C;Since the early 70s, when you measure people based on their sentiments towards opposing political parties, it&#x2019;s been kind of going up like this&#x201D;&#x2014;her hands fly upward and outward. &#x201C;So to the extent that that&#x2019;s a lot of the garbage that&#x2019;s on social media, that&#x2019;s reflecting what&#x2019;s in society.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Maybe Bickert has a point. But there&#x2019;s also a case to be made that Facebook, in trying to eradicate bad content, is locked in an unwinnable war with the world it helped create. After hastening the demise of the traditional news media by siphoning off much of its advertising revenue, then handing its platform over to whichever bottom-feeding blogs, shitposters, and fake-news profiteers could generate the most user outrage&#x2014;well, of course, there&#x2019;s plenty of toxic speech for the company to remove. And while in the real world&#x2014;or even on more rudimentary social-media platforms like Reddit&#x2014;the power of robust counter-speech can do a lot to push back against noxious commentary, on Facebook, like-minded users are herded together by the self-sorting News Feed algorithm.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>I float the argument to Katsaros that, at least in the short term, the company&#x2019;s financial incentives <em>are</em> misaligned.

The session takes place in an airy conference room on a relatively secluded part of campus.

While Facebook won&#x2019;t allow me to report on the specifics of the case, I can say that the question before the judges is this: should the court overturn Facebook&#x2019;s decision not to remove the offending content, which did not technically violate the company&#x2019;s hate-speech rules?</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>The judges break off into small panels to debate the case.

If it&#x2019;s to be a benevolent government, why is it focused almost entirely on policing users? In addition to monitoring and punishing bad behavior, shouldn&#x2019;t it be incentivizing good behavior? In November, Facebook published a study by Matt Katsaros and three academics that sought to answer that question. Currently, when users post nudity or hate speech, they get a brief, automated message informing them of the violation and the removal of their content. Katsaros and his co-authors surveyed nearly 55,000 users who had received the message. Fifty-two percent felt they had not been treated fairly, while 57 percent said it was unlikely that Facebook understood their perspective.

Last year, for the first time, the company began letting users file an appeal when Facebook removed their individual posts. But now Katsaros is gone.

His dad was a dentist; his mom, a psychiatrist. He was a stellar student and went to Harvard. He studied code and ancient Greek poetry, and one night, he created something he later called thefacebook.com and then just Facebook. There was a little legal spat with these two really tall twin brothers, and then Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher made a movie, and Jesse Eisenberg played him, and Trent Reznor composed the soundtrack. And then they I.P.O.âd.\n<p>Today, Mark Zuckerberg is the undisputed King of Tech and one of the most important innovators ever. Heâs also worth some $50 billion, almost all of which he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have pledged to charity.</p>\n<p>Probably more than anyone else in the Internet Age, Zuckerberg embodies The Type: the lanky, introverted geek who focuses laser-like on some new gizmo heâs been secretly building and then, seemingly overnight, becomes the most important person on earth. The Type doesnât need a college degree and doesnât think much of fashion. Thatâs why he wears the same T-shirt every day&#8212;the better to focus on his next app or site or whatever.</p>\n<p>There were antecedents to Zuckerberg, most obviously Bill Gates, but none of the people who came before him enjoyed the same platform, the same power to project their image on the world. And none of them created a new language for communicating with strangers everywhere. Today, billions of people across the globe like, share, post, and react to content because Zuck imagined it. Billions of people spend countless hours âfriendingâ friends and non-friends alike. Everyone is connected now. That is Zuckerbergâs legacy. His first, at least.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/25/5745d8cf614dc9a45cb0b41f_hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg","credit":"By David Ramos/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5745d8cfc1f81aa45c811831","createdAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","description":"Getty: 511709422","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/mark-zuckerberg","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/25/5745d8cf614dc9a45cb0b41f_hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg","credit":"By David Ramos/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5745d8cfc1f81aa45c811831","createdAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","description":"Getty: 511709422","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"searchable":true,"expired":false,"revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/mark-zuckerberg","distributionChannels":[{"name":"web-owned-and-operated","metadata":{"searchable":true}}],"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revision":3,"entityId":"5745d882b09823be03ef3d57"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Data Kingpin Mark Zuckerberg Faces Criminal Probe in New York","promoHed":"Data Kingpin Mark Zuckerberg Faces Criminal Probe in New York","dek":"A federal grand jury has reportedly subpoenaed records as part of a probe into Facebookâs data deals.","promoDek":"A federal grand jury has reportedly subpoenaed records as part of a probe into Facebookâs data deals.","body":"<p>After a scathing <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/digital-gangsters-british-lawmakers-torch-facebook-accuse-zuckerberg-of-contempt\">report</a> by U.K. lawmakers last month labeled Facebook a âdigital gangster,â <strong>Mark Zuckerbergâs</strong> company is facing additional scrutiny stateside. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/facebook-data-deals-investigation.html\">According</a> to <em>The New York Times,</em> a federal grand jury in New York has subpoenaed records from two companies that have done business with the social-media giant as prosecutors probe the tech behemothâs data deals. Though the scope of the investigation is unclear, the move represents perhaps the most intense scrutiny the company has faced over its handling of user data.</p>\n<p>âWe are cooperating with investigators and take those probes seriously,â a Facebook spokesperson told the <em>Times.</em> âWeâve provided public testimony, answered questions, and pledged that we will continue to do so.â</p>\n<p>The criminal probe comes amid mounting problems for Facebook, which has weathered a seemingly endless parade of P.R. nightmares, particularly over Russiaâs use of the platform to spread disinformation during the 2016 election, as well as the companyâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/zuckerberg-stumbles-headfirst-into-apples-pr-buzz-saw\">apparent disregard for user privacy</a>. In attempting damage control, Facebook brass has portrayed the companyâs problems as âabusesâ of the platform. But last monthâs report from British Parliament ripped into the company, characterizing those problems not as bugs, but âan intrinsic part of [Facebookâs] business model.â The report also blasted Zuck personally, concluding that ânothing in Facebookâs actions supports the statements of Mark Zuckerberg who, we believe, lapsed into âP.R. crisis mode,â when its real business model was exposed.â</p>\n<p>âIt seems clear to us that Facebook acts only when serious breaches become public,â the report read, accusing Facebook of believing itself to be âahead of and beyond the law.â</p>\n<p>Facebook has already been under federal scrutiny over its sharing of user data with Cambridge Analytica, the shady, now-defunct political consulting firm that worked on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/trump-campaign-distances-itself-from-cambridge-analytica-after-assange-connection-surfaces\"><strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> presidential campaign</a>. Facebook has publicly stated that the firm violated its policies, but as the <em>Times</em> noted Wednesday, âfine print accompanying a quiz app that collected the information said it could also be used commercially.â A former Cambridge Analytica employee told the <em>Times</em> heâd been questioned by investigators as recently as last month, indicating that the probe is ongoing. Facebook is also facing scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission over its handling of user data, and could be hit with a landmark fine over the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/business/ftc-facebook-privacy-investigation.html?module=inline\">possible breach</a> of a 2011 agreement between the social-media giant and the F.T.C.</p>\n<p>In spite of the onslaught, Facebookâs numbers have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/facebook-posts-record-profit-despite-scandals\">remained in the black</a>, with revenue and profits surging in the final quarter of 2018. âOur community and business continue to grow,â Zuckerberg said earlier this year in a statement announcing the companyâs gains. The grand-jury probe may not bring down Facebook single-handedly, but it seems only a matter of time before investigations into the company reach a critical mass.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from

Consider Bill Bowerman, who was eating waffles with his wife one morning in the early 1970s, when he had the epiphany that the grooves in the waffle iron could be a great mold for running shoes, an idea that would lead to the creation of Nike. Or <strong>Jeff Bezos,</strong> writing his business plan for Amazon while on a cross-country trip to Seattle.</p>\n<p>I was reflecting on these founding myths this week after <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> announced that he plans to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-privacy-pivot/\">pivot Facebook</a> away from its News Feed and social sharing, and âwill increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure.â Zuckerberg, of course, has often struggled to square his public vision for Facebook with the companyâs private history. Back at Harvard, when Zuckerberg was first building what would become Facebook, he expressed amazement that so many âdumb fucksâ would trust him with their e-mail addresses, photos, and personal information. (âIf you ever need info about anyone at Harvard,â he wrote a friend in a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/embarrassing-and-damaging-zuckerberg-ims-confirmed-by-zuckerberg-the-new-yorker-2010-9\">leaked exchanged</a>, âjust ask.â) The deceptions continued as Facebook grew into a multi-billion-dollar company. In 2011, Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/11/facebook-settles-ftc-charges-it-deceived-consumers-failing-keep\">settled</a> Federal Trade Commission charges that Facebook misled consumers by telling them they could keep their data private, and then repeatedly violating that promise. More recently, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\">revealed</a> how Facebook leadership, including Zuckerberg and C.O.O. <strong>Sheryl Sandberg,</strong> downplayed the extent to which Russian operatives and Cambridge Analytica abused its platform to influence the 2016 election, and then fought a public-relations war to obscure the scandals.</p>\n<p>Now, in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/\">3,200-word manifesto</a>, Mark Zuckerberg is telling us that Facebook can do better. But as someone who has covered this company for most of its life, I truly donât believe itâs capable of change (I once believed it could, but not anymore.) Because as much as Facebookâs public image has taken a beating&#8212;a new <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-28425848-9e0a-4ba0-9311-0da70a1276c3.html\">Axios Harris poll</a> ranking the reputations of the top 100 most visible U.S. companies places Facebook near the very bottom, at 94&#8212;the social-media giant is still printing cash. Last quarter, despite an avalanche of controversies, Facebook posted a record $6.88 billion profit, fueled by an average $7.37 in revenue per user. If Zuckerberg were really taking an ax to Facebookâs core business model, which is harvesting our most intimate data to generate ultra-targeted advertising, youâd expect Facebookâs stock to have plummeted. Instead, it hardly moved a blip. Investors, in other words, are betting that Zuckerbergâs pivot&#8212;âtowards a world where people can speak privately and live freely knowing that their information will only be seen by who they want to see itâ&#8212;is more smoke and mirrors. As <strong>Walt Mossberg</strong> <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/waltmossberg/status/1103404104938909698\">noted</a> on Twitter, âHow long has he personally believed this? An hour? A day?â</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/b377ce0d-67c7-4a58-8244-7bbe37450c03?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/b377ce0d-67c7-4a58-8244-7bbe37450c03?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

According to data from Edison Research, a national polling and research firm, an estimated 15 million people in the U.S. no longer use Facebook compared to the same time 2017. The <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/tech/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions\">research report</a> noted that younger generations, specifically people aged 12- to 34-years-old, have been abandoning the service. According to Marketplace, the report found that 80 percent of Americans are still using other social networks, but fewer are going to Facebook. âFifteen million is a lot of people, no matter which way you cut it. It represents about 6 percent of the total U.S. population ages 12 and older,â <strong>Larry Rosin,</strong> president of Edison Research, told Marketplace in an interview. âThis is the second straight year weâve seen this number go down. Obviously, the U.S. is the biggest market, in terms of dollars, and it&#39;s going to be a super important market for Facebook or anybody whoâs playing in this game.â</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg also recognizes that the current trend in social media isnât toward sharing with large groups, but smaller conversations in more intimate settings. People often wonder why Apple never purchased a social network like Twitter or Snap, and the main reason is because Apple already has a social network: itâs called iMessages. Group iMessages have replaced group chats for millions of people, and Zuckerberg knows that. The Facebook News Feed, while once the central feature of the platform, has now become a hindrance. For younger consumers, itâs anachronistic.</p>\n<p>Thatâs one reason Zuckerberg acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, spreading his bets across platforms that emphasize other modes of communication. Itâs also why Zuckerberg wants to integrate the three platforms into a single messaging system. Itâs not because he had a come-to-Jesus moment. Zuckerberg surely saw the data he is collecting from more than 2 billion users around the world and realized that people are turning away from sharing outwards, to sharing inwards. (Fusing the backends of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook together might also be a way to thwart regulators from breaking them up. Though if the Democrats win big in 2020, I have my doubts that anything can stop the inevitable.)</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5c818a2e34e7943ad32a21e0.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>What brought Zuckerberg to this point is a bit of a chicken-or-the-egg conundrum. Does the current iteration of Facebook need to change because our attitude toward privacy changed, or did society change because people donât trust Facebook? Weâre still sharing away on Instagram; people still love Pinning; Snap may not be growing like it once was, but tens of millions of people still Snap every day, and we all still log into Twitter (God help us) to see the latest political car crash. The Internet doesnât have a social problem, it has a Facebook problem.</p>\n<p>But of course, Zuckerberg wants to have his <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/facebooks-privacy-cake/\">privacy cake</a> and eat it, too. In an interview with <em>Wired</em> editor-in-chief <strong>Nick Thompson</strong> shortly after he released his manifesto, Zuckerberg appeared to walk back his big pivot. âItâs not that Facebook and Instagram are going to be less important for what theyâre doing, itâs just that people sometimes want to interact in a town square, and sometimes they want to interact in the living room, and I think that thatâs the next big frontier,â he explained. That doesnât sound like the Facebook advertising panopticon is going away. It sounds like a feint in which Facebook can keep reaping the benefits of its lucrative social platform while also dominating the market for private, encrypted conversations.</p>\n<p>Over the years covering Facebook, Iâve had several former executives at the company tell me that Zuckerberg rarely reads the tech press. He thinks as fondly of most journalists as <strong>Donald Trump</strong> does about CNN. Which is fine and his prerogative, but Zuckerberg is seemingly oblivious to how people really feel about him. He is, without question, one of the least trusted tech executives alive today. When <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> says he is going to do something with Microsoft, people donât question his ulterior motives. When <strong>Tim Cook</strong> (or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/8/18256467/tim-apple-cook-donald-trump-ivanka\">Tim Apple</a>) says heâs going to do something at Apple, people donât squint their eyes trying to see where the deceit may lay in his statement. Yet, with Zuckerberg, itâs the complete opposite. Zuckerberg could tell the world heâs giving away all of his stock, selling his homes, and walking barefoot around the globe in penance for his sins, and we would all wonder if heâs secretly figured out how to generate advertising money from people who walk around the globe barefoot. Facebook can pivot as many times as it wants, but the problem isnât Facebook, itâs Zuckerberg.</p>","rubric":"Facebook","socialTitle":"The False Promise of Zuckerbergâs Come-to-Jesus Manifesto","socialDescription":"Zuckerberg says that Facebook can do better.

Will Warren and co. bite?","body":"<p>In a seeming effort to rehabilitate Facebookâs crumbling image, and to get out ahead of looming government controls, <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> has transformed himself into a veritable lobbyist for social-media regulation. The operation began in earnest over the weekend with an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html\">op-ed</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em> in which the Facebook C.E.O. outlined four areas where heâd like to see regulation: âharmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data portability.â Soon, Axios <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-3035e863-304c-4d59-bbb3-51ad467d3f34.html\">reported</a> Monday, Zuckerberg will take his message directly to Capitol Hill, where heâll do some glad-handing in an attempt to get back in lawmakersâ good graces.</p>\n<p>The hope, it seems, is that by proposing regulations himself, Zuckerberg can avoid the more restrictive ones global watchdogs may look to apply. The campaign also appears to be an attempt to make Zuckerberg and co. seem responsive to concerns and accountable for their platformâs issues, rather than the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/digital-gangsters-british-lawmakers-torch-facebook-accuse-zuckerberg-of-contempt\">âdigital gangstersâ</a> British lawmakers have portrayed. âThe rules governing the internet allowed a generation of entrepreneurs to build services that changed the world and created a lot of value in peopleâs lives,â Zuckerberg wrote in the <em>Post</em> Saturday. âItâs time to update these rules to define clear responsibilities for people, companies, and governments going forward.â</p>\n<p>The social-media giant has faced a barrage of bad P.R. recently over its handling of user data and its role in the spread of misinformation. Some of the most exacting scrutiny has occurred abroad, with British Parliament torching Facebookâs leadership in a damning February report that concluded some of the platformâs most troublesome problems are not bugs, but âintrinsicâ features of its business model. But Facebook has also faced pressure at home&#8212;just last week the Department of Housing and Urban Development <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/ben-carson-sues-facebook-for-discrimination\">charged</a> the company with alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act. And Washington lawmakers may be looking to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/anti-trust-chief-margrethe-vestager-blasts-another-hole-through-google\">close their regulatory gap</a> with Europe.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, Zuckerberg is getting proactive. In his <em>Post</em> piece, the Facebook founder called for a third-party review panel to address issues of harmful content on Facebook and other social-media platforms. âItâs impossible to remove all harmful content from the Internet, but when people use dozens of different sharing services&#8212;all with their own policies and processes&#8212;we need a more standardized approach,â he wrote. Where election security is concerned, he described steps he says Facebook has taken to address misleading political ads, but argued that the government needs to set clearer guidelines for tech companies. âWe believe legislation should be updated to reflect the reality of the threats and set standards for the whole industry,â he wrote. On privacy, one of the areas where Facebook has been most criticized, Zuckerberg called for policy âin line withâ the E.U.âs General Data Protection Regulation. The American version, he said, âshould protect your right to choose how your information is used&#8212;while enabling companies to use information for safety purposes and to provide services.â</p>\n<p>All of this might sound reasonable on its face&#8212;Zuckerberg even endorsed leveling âsanctionsâ against his own company when it screws up&#8212;but a skeptic might argue that the show of goodwill doubles as an attempt to pre-empt tougher laws. Partnering with D.C. lawmakers gives Facebook the chance to impose its viewpoint, and a front-row seat to whatever changes regulators may propose. Zuckerbergâs message also seems to ring hollow, as U.K. Information Commissioner <strong>Elizabeth Denham</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47778093\">pointed out</a> Monday, given Facebookâs current challenge against the fine she imposed on the company over its Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why is Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/why-donald-trump-is-obsessed-with-orourke?inline\">obsessed with Beto OâRourke?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/the-boeing-tragedy-is-just-the-beginning-of-the-self-driving-techpocalypse?inline\">self-driving techpocalypse:</a> the Boeing tragedy is just the beginning</p>\n<p>&#8212; Inside the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/inside-hollywoods-disney-fox-freakout?inline\">Disney-Fox Freakout</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-vs-biden?inline\">Beto vs. Biden:</a> who is Obamaâs true heir apparent?</p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story?inline\">Cover story:</a> Riding around with Beto OâRourke as he comes to grips with a presidential run</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Facebook","socialTitle":"Can Mark Zuckerberg Outsmart Elizabeth Warren?","socialDescription":"The Facebook C.E.O. is trying to get ahead of regulators by offering to help write the rules constraining Silicon Valley.

Media, and Sport Committee called Facebookâs problems an âintrinsic part of its business model,â and proposed steps for regulation.","body":"<p>Facebookâs problems donât stem from âabusesâ of the platform, but are instead an âintrinsic part of its business modelâ&#8212;so says a <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/1791.pdf\">report</a> out of British Parliament on Monday that excoriates the social-media giant for its handling of usersâ data and calls for stronger regulation. âFar from Facebook acting against âsketchyâ or âabusiveâ apps, of which it has produced no evidence at all, it, in fact, worked with such apps as an intrinsic part of its business model,â the report read. âNothing in Facebookâs actions supports the statements of <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> who, we believe, lapsed into âP.R. crisis mode,â when its real business model was exposed.â</p>\n<p>The report is the result of an investigation by the U.K.âs Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee (D.C.M.S.C.) into âdisinformation and âfake newsââ online, and tears into Facebook in particular for how it has handled user data. Zuckerberg and <strong>Sheryl Sandberg</strong> have insisted that episodes such as Cambridge Analyticaâs hijacking of Facebook data constitute <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/4/5/17200918/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-data-privacy\">âabuseâ</a> of its system. But according to British lawmakers, Facebook brass has responded in âbad faithâ to such issues, and should be held âat armsâ lengthâ by governments. âIt seems clear to us that Facebook acts only when serious breaches become public,â the committeeâs report read. âCompanies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like âdigital gangstersâ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law.â</p>\n<p>In a separate statement, D.C.M.S.C. chair <strong>Damian Collins</strong> took Zuckerberg to task in particular for âcontinually fail[ing] to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the worldâs biggest companies.â He added that âevidence uncovered by my committee shows he still has questions to answer yet heâs continued to duck them, refusing to respond to our invitations directly or sending representatives who don&#39;t have the right information.â</p>\n<p>Though much of the report focused on Facebook, it also included regulatory recommendations for social-media platforms in general, including that they be required to adhere to a code of ethics; that they be monitored by an independent U.K. regulator; and that regulators should investigate Facebook for anti-competitive practices. In response, <strong>Karim Palant,</strong> Facebookâs U.K. public-policy manager, said in a statement that the company is âopen to meaningful regulation and support[s] the committeeâs recommendation for electoral law reform. We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.â</p>\n<p>Whether Facebook will ultimately be held to these standards is unclear. Despite its <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/facebook-posts-record-profit-despite-scandals\">endless parade of scandals</a> and negative press, the company has somehow continued to prosper, gaining both revenue and users last year.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Can it do better against trolls and racists? An exclusive embed with Facebookâs shadow government.","body":"<h2><em>Men are scum.</em></h2>\n<h5>You canât say that on Facebook.</h5>\n<h5><em>Men are pigs</em>. You canât say that either.</h5>\n<h5><em>Men are trash. Men are garbage fires.</em></h5>\n<h5>Also banned.</h5>\n<p>Itâs nine A.M. on an autumn Tuesday, and Iâm sitting in on a meeting about âmen are scumâ at Facebookâs campus in Menlo Park, California. The trouble started a year ago, in the fall of 2017. The #MeToo movement had recently begun. Nicole Silverberg, currently a writer on <em>Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</em>, had shared on her Facebook page a trove of bilious comments directed at her after sheâd written a list of ways men âneed to do better.â In the comments section beneath her post, another comic, Marcia Belsky, wrote, âMen are scum.â Facebook kicked Belsky off the platform for 30 days.</p>\n<p>This seemed absurd. First of all, the news at the time was dominated by stories of men acting scummily. Second, Facebook had been leaving up plenty of well-documented crap. By then the company was deep into an extended cycle of bad press over the toxic, fraudulent, and/or covertly Russian content that had polluted its platform throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. In Western Europe, the far right was using the site to vilify Middle Eastern migrants. In Southeast Asia, authoritarian regimes were using it to dial up anger against religious minorities and political enemies. But Facebook was taking down âmen are scumâ?</p>\n<p>Belsky hopped on a 500-person (Facebook) group of female comics. A bunch of them were getting banned for similar infractions, even as they reported sexist invective being hurled their way. They decided to protest by spamming the platform. On November 24, dozens of âmen are scumâ posts went up. And then â¦ they came right down. Belsky was put back in Facebook jail. The women of Men Are Scum became a brief Internet cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre, another data point in the never-ending narrative that <em>Facebook doesnât care about you</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=likes-hate\"><iframe height=\"100\" width=\"350\" src=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=likes-hate\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Ten months later, the issue hasnât gone away, and Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg has let it be known within the company that he, too, is concerned by the policy. Todayâs meeting is part of an ongoing attempt to solve the problem. The session takes place in Building 23, which, compared with the glorious Frank Gehry-designed offices on the other side of campus, is small and relatively nondescript. No majestic redwood trees, no High Line-inspired rooftop park. Even its signage&#8212;inspirational photo illustrations of Elie Wiesel and Malala&#8212;suggests a more innocent era, when the companyâs ethos seemed more daftly utopian than sinister. The meeting room is called âOh, Semantics.â All the rooms at Facebook have cute names like âAtticus Finchâ or âMarble Rye,â after the <em>Seinfeld</em> episode. Mostly they seem random, but this one feels apt, because Oh, Semantics is where the companyâs shadow government has been meeting, every two weeks, to debate what you can and cannot post on Facebook.</p>\n<p>No companyâs image and reputation are as strongly linked to its C.E.O. as Facebookâs. (Who in the general population can name the chief executive of Google? Of Walmart?) This is partly because the C.E.O. invented the company. Itâs partly because his image as smart-ass founder was immortalized in a successful Hollywood movie. And itâs partly because heâs young and awkward and seems to make mistakes all the time. As a result, people tend to judge Facebook through the prism of Mark Zuckerbergâs gaffes and missteps. Call it the not-so-great-man theory of history.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to figuring out how Facebook actually works&#8212;how it decides what content is allowed, and what isnât&#8212;the most important person in the company isnât Mark Zuckerberg. Itâs Monika Bickert, a former federal prosecutor and Harvard Law School graduate. At 42, Bickert is currently one of only a handful of people, along with her counterparts at Google, with real power to dictate free-speech norms for the entire world. In Oh, Semantics, she sits at the head of a long table, joined by several dozen deputies in their 30s and 40s. Among them are engineers, lawyers, and P.R. people. But mostly they are policymakers, the people who write Facebookâs laws. Like Bickert, a number are veterans of the public sector, Obama-administration refugees eager to maintain some semblance of the pragmatism that has lost favor in Washington.</p>\n<p>Tall and thin, with long strawberry-blond hair, Bickert sits behind a laptop decorated with a TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES sticker. She speaks neither in guarded corporatese nor in the faux-altruistic argot particular to Silicon Valley. As a relative newcomer to the tech industry, she regards Facebook with the ambivalence of a normal person, telling me sheâs relieved her two teenage daughters are ânot all about sharing everythingâ on social media. When I cite Facebookâs stated mission to make the world a âmore open and connected place,â she literally rolls her eyes. âItâs a company. Itâs a business,â she says. âLike, I am not, I guess, apologetic about the reality that we have to answer to advertisers or the public or regulators.â To her, Facebook is neither utopian nor dystopian. Itâs just massively influential and, for the moment, not going anywhere.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the 2016 election, Zuckerberg embarked on a ludicrous nationwide listening tour. While he was feeding calves in Wisconsin, Bickert and her team began methodically re-writing many of the policies that had fueled the worldâs anti-Facebook animus. Last fall, Facebook agreed to show me exactly how they did it. I was granted unrestricted access to closed-door meetings like the one in Oh, Semantics, permitted to review internal deliberations on the companyâs Slack-like messaging system, and provided with slide decks and Excel spreadsheets that lay out the minutiae of the new policies.</p>\n<p>The topics discussed in Bickertâs policy meetings are almost always bummers. Todayâs agenda: terrorism, non-sexual adult nudity, editing disturbing content on the pages of dead people, and, finally, âmen are scum.â The issue is introduced by Mary deBree, who worked in Obamaâs State Department. âWe donât want to silence people when theyâre trying to raise awareness around&#8212;for example&#8212;sexual assault,â she begins. However. âHowever, um, the tension in this is that, if we allow more attacks on the basis of gender, this may also lead to more misogynistic content on the platform.â</p>\n<p>Hence the dilemma.</p>\n<p>When Facebook mass-deletes âmen are scum,â itâs not thanks to top-down bias at the company, or some rogue menâs-rights Facebooker taking his stand against misandry. Nor is it a boneheaded âenforcement errorâ caused by one of Facebookâs 15,000 human content moderators around the world. The posts get removed because of one of Monika Bickertâs well-intentioned, though possibly doomed, policies.</p>\n<div class=\"embed image row\"><figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"><div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"><img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c756e2c52ce6720b3607d52/master/w_690,c_limit/facebook-march-2019-02.jpg\" alt=\" Andy OâConnell standing at this desk.\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"SOLVING FOR HATE\nAt Facebookâs headquarters, in Menlo Park, the companyâs team of experts&#8212;including veterans of the Obama administration&#8212;are working to identify and combat hate speech.

Theyâre called Community Standards, and they were made public in full for the first time in April 2018. One of them is hate speech, which Facebook defines as an âattackâ against a âprotected characteristic,â such as gender, sexuality, race, or religion. And one of the most serious ways to attack someone, Facebook has decided, is to compare them to something dehumanizing.</p>\n<p>Like: <em>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically inferior</em>.</p>\n<p>Or: <em>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces</em>.</p>\n<p>That means statements like âblack people are monkeysâ and âKoreans are the scum of the earthâ are subject to removal. But then, so is âmen are trash.â</p>\n<p>See the problem? If you remove dehumanizing attacks against gender, you may block speech designed to draw attention to a social movement like #MeToo. If you allow dehumanizing attacks against gender, well, youâre allowing dehumanizing attacks against gender. And if you do that, how do you defend other âprotectedâ groups from similar attacks?</p>\n<p>DeBree and one of her colleagues, a China expert named David Caragliano, float a handful of fixes. Idea one: punish attacks against gender less harshly than, say, attacks against race. âMen are scumâ would stay up. But so would âwomen are scum.â This doesnât seem quite right.</p>\n<p>Another idea is to treat the genders themselves differently. Caragliano cues up a slide deck. On it is a graph showing internal research that Facebook users are more upset by attacks against women than they are by attacks against men. Women would be protected against all hate speech, while men would be protected only against explicit calls for violence. âWomen are scumâ would be removed. âMen are scumâ could stay.</p>\n<p>Problem solved? Well â¦ not quite. Bickert foresees another hurdle. âMy instinct is not to treat the genders differently,â she tells me. âWe live in a world where we now acknowledge there are many genders, not just men and women. I suspect the attacks you see are disproportionately against those genders and women, but not men.â If you create a policy based on that logic, though, âyou end up in this space where itâs like, âOur hate-speech policy applies to everybody&#8212;except for men.â â Imagine how that would play.</p>\n<div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span><blockquote>\n<p>To understand how Facebook <strong>polices hate speech is</strong> to understand\nhow Facebookâs <strong>brain works</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</span><div class=\"component-social-share pullquote mono closed\" data-component=\"SocialShare\" role=\"list\"><div class=\"share-item twitter\" data-component=\"twitter\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0ATo%20understand%20how%20Facebook%20polices%20hate%20speech%20is%20to%20understand%0Ahow%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20brain%20works.%0A%0A%22&amp;via=VanityFair&amp;url=\" role=\"listitem\"><a aria-label=\"Tweet\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0ATo%20understand%20how%20Facebook%20polices%20hate%20speech%20is%20to%20understand%0Ahow%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20brain%20works.%0A%0A%22&amp;via=VanityFair&amp;url=\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"icon\"></span><span class=\"label\">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p>To anyone who followed the âmen are scumâ issue from afar, Facebookâs inaction made it look aloof. In truth, âmen are scumâ is a well-known and much-debated topic in Menlo Park, with improbably large implications for the governing philosophy of the platform and, thus, the Internet. For philosophical and financial reasons, Facebook was established with one set of universally shared values. And in order to facilitate as much âsharingâ as possible, no one group or individual would be treated differently from another. If you couldnât call women âscum,â then you couldnât call men âscum,â either.</p>\n<p>If you take a step back, itâs kind of an idealistic way to think about the world. Itâs also a classically Western, liberal way to think about the world. Give everyone an equal shot at free expression, and democracy and liberty will naturally flourish. Unfortunately, the more Facebook grows, the less democracy and liberty seem to be flourishing. Likewise, the more permissive Facebookâs platform, the more prone it is to be corrupted by trolls, bots, fake news, propaganda, and bigotry. Yet the more Facebook cracks down on that stuff, the more it looks like the companyâs premise was compromised from the start.</p>\n<p>Thatâs the problem with running a shadow government that seeks to regulate the speech of 2.3 billion people. Governing, by its nature, demands trade-offs. But much of the world right now is not in the mood for trade-offs. People gravitate to Facebook, in part, to live in cocoons of their own making. If Facebook has created a parallel online society for a quarter of the world to live in, the question facing Monika Bickert and her team is: What kind of society is it going to be?</p>\n<p><strong>In the beginning</strong> there was no shadow government at Facebook. There was just Dave. Dave Willner, Facebookâs very first rulemaker. When Willner arrived at the company, in 2008, Facebook had about 145 million monthly users. Prior to his arrival, the people deciding what was allowed on the platform were also the people answering customer-service e-mails. Mostly, users complained that they wanted embarrassing party pics taken down. The companyâs policy was essentially to take down âHitler and naked peopleâ plus âanything else that makes you feel uncomfortable.â Willner started clicking through 15,000 photos a day, removing things that made him uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>That wasnât ideal. So Willner wrote Facebookâs first constitution, a set of laws called Community Standards. He and his small brain trust generally adhered to John Stuart Millâs seminal principle that speech should be banned only if used to stoke violence against others. This hands-off philosophy also aligned with Facebookâs self-interest. More speech equals more users, and more users equals more ad revenue. Plus, by positioning itself as an open âplatformâ rather than a publisher, Facebook could not be sued for libel, like a newspaper could. False information would stay up. Only obviously toxic content like terrorist propaganda, bullying, and graphic violence&#8212;plus criminal activity, like child pornography and drug trafficking&#8212;would come down. As would hate speech.</p>\n<p>By 2013, when Willner left Facebook, the companyâs user base had grown nearly tenfold, to 1.2 billion. The company, which was expanding to include the purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram, had gotten way too big for Community Standards 1.0. That year, Bickert took over as Facebookâs content czar. A native of Southern California, Bickert spent the first phase of her career at the Justice Department in Chicago, prosecuting gang violence and public corruption. She spent the second phase at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, where she extradited child sex traffickers. While her primary focus was protecting kids, she also began to think more about freedom of speech, thanks to strict laws against criticizing the Thai monarchy. She was, in other words, already weighing versions of the fundamental tension&#8212;âsafetyâ vs. âvoiceâ&#8212;that undergirds all of Facebookâs policy decisions.</p>\n<p>When Bickert started the job, Facebook was in panic mode. The Boston Marathon bombing had just occurred, and moderators were flagging photojournalism as graphic violence. Images of blown-off limbs, which clearly violated the policy, were being removed. And yet they were clearly newsworthy. The images were ultimately restored.</p>\n<p>A month later, the opposite problem. The Internet began protesting violent rape jokes that <em>werenât</em> being yanked from the platform. Facebook explained that its policies allowed for toxic speech that didnât seem likely to provoke physical harm. But after several companies pulled their ads, Facebook took down the jokes and pledged to re-write its policies. What had started as an anodyne platform for people to share photos and random musings was now a media giant that an increasing share of the world relied on for news. It wasnât so obvious anymore what content was or wasnât inappropriate.</p>\n<p>The differences between policing the real world and policing the Internet became manifest. âThe level of context you have when youâre looking at criminal laws&#8212;thereâs fact-finding, you provide evidence on both sides, you actually look at the problem in a 360-degree way,â Bickert says. âWe donât. We have a snippet of something online. We donât know whoâs behind this. Or what theyâre like. So itâs a system at maximum scale with very imperfect information.â</p>\n<p>Bickert started building out the policy team in her own image. Though she is trained as a litigator, her engaging manner and easy intellect are more redolent of a law professor. On Facebookâs campus, she hired a high-school teacher, a rape crisis counselor, a West Point counterterrorism expert, a Defense Department researcher. âI was hiring people who werenât coming here because they cared about Facebook necessarily,â she says, but because they believed they could exert more influence in Menlo Park than in academia or gridlocked Washington.</p>\n<p>By 2015, Bickert had teamed up with two other Facebook executives, Ellen Silver and Guy Rosen, to police bad content in a more targeted way. Bickert would set the policies. Silver would work with content moderators to implement them. And Rosen would build proactive detection tools to get in front of them. They called themselves âthe three-sided coin.â (Leave it to Facebook to name its governing structure after money.)</p>\n<p>Thanks to Rosenâs efforts, the company got masterful at eradicating porn and terrorist propaganda, which were fairly easy for artificial intelligence to classify. The rest of the hard-to-look-at stuff&#8212;violent threats, sexual solicitation and trafficking, images of self-harm and suicide, harassment, doxing, and hate speech&#8212;was largely up to humans to catch. First, individual Facebook users had to flag content they didnât like. Then Facebookâs moderators, working across three continents, would consult manuals prepared by Silverâs team to see if it actually violated any of Bickertâs policies.</p>\n<p>After the 2016 election, however, this system began to feel inadequate to the enormity of the task. When I ask Bickert the biggest difference in her job now versus five years ago, she replies without hesitation. âSocial climate,â she says. âImmigration into Europe. Ethnic tension. Sharply contested elections. The rise of hot speech.â Meanwhile, problems no one had anticipated, like fake news and misinformation, had also announced themselves on the platform. And that was all before the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook was revealed to have turned over the personal information of tens of millions of users to a Trump-linked political consultancy.</p>\n<p>Facebookâs reputation tanked. Many Silicon Valley elders, including some of the companyâs early backers, went full apostate and denounced the platform. Zuckerberg wrote a 5,700-word <em>mea culpa</em> in which he conceded that the company may have had a negative impact on our âsocial infrastructure.â A bleak consensus emerged. To make money, observed former Slate editor Jacob Weisberg, Facebook had addicted us and sold our eyeballs to advertisers. In return, it made us âselfish, disagreeable, and lonely, while corroding democracy, truth, and economic equality.â</p>\n<p>In the midst of all the bad press, in 2017, ProPublica dropped a bombshell report that directly impugned the companyâs Community Standards. Sifting through troves of leaked content-moderation manuals, ProPublica discovered a number of strange and seemingly inexplicable policies. The most alarming: âwhite menâ were protected by the companyâs hate-speech laws, while âblack childrenâ were not. After a year of damning headlines about Facebook, media coverage of the policy presumed the worst about the companyâs motivations.</p>\n<p>Bickert decided she needed to re-write Facebookâs hate-speech laws. Four years into her job, here was her moment to see if she could, in her own way, redeem the company. By fixing the problems the original âmove fast and break thingsâ generation didnât foresee&#8212;or created in the first place&#8212;maybe Facebookâs hidden legislative body could finally make the world a better place.</p>\n<div class=\"embed image row\"><figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"><div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"><img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c756e30f926b42d6190f869/master/w_690,c_limit/facebook-march-2019-04.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook headquarters with policy managers.\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"Bickert, with policy managers Gaurav Upot, Mary deBree, and David Caragliano.\n\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/><a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F02%2Fmen-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5c756e30f926b42d6190f869%2Fmaster%2Fw_690%2Cc_limit%2Ffacebook-march-2019-04.jpg&amp;description=Bickert%2C%20with%20policy%20managers%20Gaurav%20Upot%2C%20Mary%20deBree%2C%20and%20David%20Caragliano.%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div><figcaption class=\"caption callout-image-caption\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><span class=\"caption\"><p>Bickert, with policy managers Gaurav Upot, Mary deBree, and David Caragliano.</p>\n</span><div class=\"credits\">Photograph by Balazs Gardi.</div></div></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Itâs a clichÃ©</strong> of Silicon Valley that tech campuses are stocked with infantilizing perks and free food. The conventional wisdom is that these things keep employees from ever leaving the premises. Another reason becomes clear when you visit Facebook: there is absolutely nothing to do within a five-mile radius of campus. Step outside One Hacker Way, in Menlo Park, and you are met with highway on one side and pungent, marshy salt ponds on the other. The whole area feels strip-mined of natural beauty. All of which makes it both obscene and highly pleasant to sit in the shade of the redwood trees that were dug up and hauled to a woodsy outdoor gathering space on the grounds of Building 21. Facebookâs campus exists, in other words, as a physical manifestation of its business model: a privatization of the public square. And that hybrid status raises novel questions about how an individual company can&#8212;or should&#8212;regulate the speech of billions.</p>\n<p>Of all the prohibited content on the platform, hate speech is by far the hardest to adjudicate. First, there isnât an obvious way to define it. In the U.S., thereâs no legal category for hate speech; in Europe, itâs delineated pretty specifically. Second, because people post hateful stuff for all kinds of personal and idiosyncratic reasons, there isnât a systemic way to disincentivize it. To understand how Facebook polices hate speech is to understand how Facebookâs brain works.</p>\n<p>I head to a small, pod-like room in Building 23 to meet with the two lead arÂ­chitects of the hate-speech revamp: Gaurav Upot, a seven-year veteran of the company, and David Caragliano, of the âmen are scumâ powwow. Caragliano begins, pulling up a slide deck. âThe way I think about this is, we were in the worst of all worlds.â In one way, the old hate-speech policy was too narrow. The way it was written, you couldnât say you wanted to âkillâ a member of a protected group, like a Catholic or a Latina. But you could say you wanted to kill Catholic <em>theologians</em> or Latina <em>actresses</em>. The thinking was, if youâre being that specific, youâre almost certainly exaggerating, or joking, or maybe just upset about a crummy movie. The problem was that age, like âtheologiansâ or âactresses,â wasnât classified as a protected category. Thatâs how attacks on âblack childrenâ slipped through the net, while hating on âwhite menâ was banned.</p>\n<p>In a different way, the policy was also too broad. In 2017, a lot of L.G.B.T.Q. people were posting the word âdykeâ on Facebook. That was deemed a slur, and was duly removed. A blind spot was exposed. Facebook, it has been observed, is able to judge content&#8212;but not intent. Matt Katsaros, a Facebook researcher who worked extensively on hate speech, cites an unexpected problem with flagging slurs. âThe policy had drawn a distinction between âniggerâ and ânigga,â â he explains. The first was banned, the second was allowed. Makes sense. âBut then we found that in Africa many use âniggerâ the same way people in America use ânigga.â â Back to the drawing board.</p>\n<p>Caragliano and Upot began writing a granular policy meant to solve both these problems. A matrix of hate-speech laws from across the European Union that Caragliano prepared highlights the complexity of their endeavor&#8212;and a tacit admission that Facebookâs global standards arenât really feasible in practice. On the y-axis of the chart are a number of hypothetical hate-speech examples. On the x-axis are various E.U. nationsâ tolerance of the speech. So, for example, âMuslims are criminalsâ is clearly illegal in Belgium and France, likely legal in Denmark and Italy, and likely illegal in England and Germany. (And banned by Facebook.)</p>\n<p>Caragliano and Upot pulled input from seven Facebook departments and more than 30 academics, NGOs, and activist groups. It took them four months to finish an initial revise of the policy. When they finished, in October 2017, it looked like this: Attacks would be divided into three categories of severity. The first included calls to violence (âkillâ), dehumanizing words (âscumâ), and offensive visual stereotypes (depicting a Jewish person as a rat). The second included âstatements of inferiority.â The third encompassed âcalls for exclusion.â Slurs, meanwhile, would be quarantined in their own context-dependent mini-category.</p>\n<p>The revamp allowed Facebook to target problematic speech more specifically. Guy Rosenâs team, for example, trained its automatic detection classifier to seek only the most severe tier of hate speech. Since then, Facebook has gone from flagging about a quarter of all hate speech before users do, to more than half, without accidentally removing proud uses of âdyke.â The new rules also enabled Facebook to better classify overlooked categories like âCatholic theologiansâ or âblack children,â who were now protected from hateful attacks.</p>\n<p>Hereâs how it works in practice: late last year, Facebook removed several posts by Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israelâs prime minister. Netanyahu had called Palestinians âmonstersâ and advocated that âall the Muslims leave the land of Israel.â Palestinians and Muslims are both protected groups. âMonsterâ is dehumanizing, âleaveâ is a call for exclusion, and both are classified as hate speech. The removal was consistent with the new policy. In response, Netanyahu called Facebook âthe thought police.â</p>\n<p>All these changes, though, were happening in private. Last September, when Facebook C.O.O. Sheryl Sandberg testified before Congress about the threat of foreign interference in the upcoming midterm elections, Senator Kamala Harris took the occasion to grill her about the âblack childrenâ incident. Sandberg responded with a canned and confusing answer that reinforced the wide perception that Facebook is full of crap. âWe care tremendously about civil rights,â Sandberg said. âWe have worked closely with civil-rights groups to find hate speech on our platform and take it down.â Harris asked her to specify when the problematic policy had been changed. Sandberg couldnât answer.</p>\n<p>If Bickert was watching back in Menlo Park, she must have been beside herself. The âblack childrenâ loophole, which was at its root an operational issue, had been closed more than a year earlier. The gap between the competence of the policy wonks who write Facebookâs rules, and the high-profile executives who defend them in public, could hardly have seemed wider.</p>\n<p><strong>Not long after</strong> Sandbergâs testimony, at a diner in Palo Alto, I ask Bickert who her John Stuart Mill is. Louis Brandeis, she tells me, the former Supreme Court justice who helped enshrine free speech as a bedrock of 20th-century American democracy. âThe Brandeis idea that you need people to be able to have the conversation, that thatâs how they learn, that thatâs how we develop an informed society that can govern itself&#8212;that matters, I think.â</p>\n<p>In general, Bickert would rather not censor content thatâs part of the national discourse, even when itâs blatantly hateful. A prime example: in 2017, just before Facebook began re-writing its hate-speech policies, U.S. representative Clay Higgins of Louisiana posted a message on his Facebook wall demanding that all âradicalized Islamic suspectsâ be executed. âHunt them, identify them, and kill them,â he wrote. âKill them all.â People were obviously outraged. But Facebook left the message up, as it didnât violate the companyâs hate-speech rules. (âRadicalized Islamic suspectsâ wasnât a protected category.) Post-revamp, that outburst would run afoul of the Community Standards. Yet Facebook has not taken the message down, citing an exemption for ânewsworthyâ content. âWouldnât you want to be able to discuss that?â Bickert asks, when I point to Higginsâs post. âWe really do want to give people room to share their political views, even when they are distasteful.â</p>\n<p>Bickert is articulating not just the classic Facebookian position that <em>sharing is good,</em> but also what used to be a fairly uncontroversial idea, protected by the First Amendment, that a democratic society functions best when people have the right to say what they want, no matter how offensive. This Brandeisian principle, she fears, is eroding. âItâs scary,â she says. âWhen they talk to people on U.S. college campuses and ask how important freedom of speech is to you, something like 60 percent say itâs not important at all. The outrage about Facebook tends to push in the direction of taking down more speech. Fewer groups are willing to stand up for unpopular speech.â</p>\n<p>Increasingly, real-world events are testing whether Facebook can cling to a vision of liberalism in which one set of laws applies to everyone, or whether it needs to transition to a social-justice-minded model in which certain groups warrant more protection than others. In the wake of the Syrian-refugee crisis, for instance, negative comments about Muslim migrants began flooding Facebook pages in Europe. Some advocated for tight borders. Some were straight-up racist. The goal, as Bickert saw it, was to find a middle ground, to avoid painting charged political speech with the same brush as legitimate hate speech. In 2016, Facebook devised a fix. Immigrants would be âquasi-protected.â You couldnât call them âscum,â but you could call for their exclusion from a country. Facebook was starting to draw lines it had never before drawn.</p>\n<p>When the âmen are scumâ problem first landed on its radar, in late 2017, Facebook began to consider an even more radical step. Should some groups be protected more than others? Women more than men, say, or gay people more than straight people? âPeople recognize power dynamics and feel like we are tone-deaf not to address them,â Caragliano says. After the policy meeting in Oh, Semantics last fall, Caragliano and deBree spun off four separate working groups to devise a fix for âmen are scum.â Over the course of the next four months, they studied 6,800 examples of gendered hate speech that had appeared on the platform. It was easy, deBree said, to find reasons to defend a statement like âmen are disgusting.â But it felt wrong to let users say âgay men are disgustingâ or âChinese men are disgusting.â In the end, in late January of this year, Facebook arrived at a deflating consensus: nothing would change.</p>\n<p>In the abstract, almost everyone on Bickertâs team favored a hate-speech policy that took into account power imbalances between different groups. But for a user base of more than two billion people, such changes proved impossible to scale. On some level, there are no âfixesâ to Facebookâs problems. There are only trade-offs. Like an actual government, it seemed, the best Facebook could hope for was a bunch of half-decent compromises. And like a government, anything it did would still piss off at least half its constituents.</p>\n<p><strong>There is a</strong> wide assumption, not unfounded, that Facebook has a financial stake in leaving total garbage up on its site. Reams of evidence, anecdotal and scholarly, suggest that its News Feed algorithm rewards inflammatory and addictive content. Even as the company has vowed over the past year to prioritize âlocal,â âmeaningful,â and âinformativeâ content, a shameless British clickbait site called LadBible consistently ranks as its top publisher. Unilad.com, which is basically the same thing, is rarely far behind. So are Breitbart, TMZ, and the <em>Daily Mail</em>. Facebook, as <em>Wired</em> editor Nicholas Thompson puts it, feeds us Cheetos rather than kale.</p>\n<p>The problem with eradicating this sort of junk food is that the News Feed rewards stuff that people click on. Paternalistically replace it with high-minded content, and youâll lose customers. Writing in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times Magazine</em> a couple years ago, Farhad Manjoo implied that Facebook, other than making money off clicks, didnât really have a policy agenda at all. âThe people who work on News Feed arenât making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition, or seniority,â he wrote. âThe News Feed teamâs ultimate mission is to figure out what users want [and] to give them more of that.â And what people want, evidently, is Cheetos.</p>\n<p>But hate speech, fascinatingly, doesnât work like this. If you give Facebook users too much of it, they actually do go away. On one of my visits to Facebook, I go out to dinner with Matt Katsaros, the hate-speech researcher. He lives in San Franciscoâs Outer Sunset, which sits on the lip of the Pacific, and is one of the last neighborhoods in the city not yet spoiled by tech zillionaires. The sleepiness of the place suits Katsaros, a 30-year-old who in his spare time works as a textile artist.</p>\n<p>Having spent the last several years staring at hate speech on the Internet, Katsaros is probably one of the worldâs experts on disturbing social-media content. (âThereâs a lot of women being compared to kitchen appliances right now,â he tells me.) The emotional toll of his job has significantly decreased his own appetite for ever posting anything on Facebook. âI spend my day talking to people who say, âOh, they took a picture of me and wrote <em>faggot</em> on top of it.â â That, he says, is exactly why the company has a strong interest in eradicating hate speech. Some amount of inflammatory speech revs people up. But crank the ugliness dial too far, the research shows, and people withdraw. âThereâs no incentive for us to have that stuff,â he says. âPeople get silenced, they donât engage, and then they go off to do something else.â</p>\n<p>Bickert makes a similar argument. âPeople will say, âOh, your business interests are not aligned with the safety interests of the community.â I completely disagree with that,â she says. Not only does hate speech turn others off, but the people who post it may not be ideal moneymakers for the company. âThose people are not likely to click on an ad for shoes, you know, in the middle of their hate. The person who is looking at puppy videos is a lot more likely.â</p>\n<p>Last year, Facebook finally started posting metrics about how much banned content it was taking down from the site. Itâs impossible to know exactly how much of the bad stuff theyâre removing, since many users donât report toxic content in the first place. (This is one reason it can be difficult to identify hate speech against persecuted minorities around the world: many users donât consider it hate speech at all.) Still, the numbers are encouraging. From October to December of 2017, Facebook purged about 1.6 million pieces of hate speech. From July to September of 2018, that number spiked to 2.9 million, or some 30,000 pieces a day.</p>\n<p>Facebook presumably wouldnât be doing all this if it were actually invested in keeping its user base frothing at the mouth. Indeed, compared with early, failed social-media platforms like MySpace, Facebook is highly regulated. At the same time, itâs disturbing that the platform hosts so much toxicity in the first place. Bickertâs theory is that Facebook has gotten so big itâs come to mirror the ugliness of the rest of the world. âIâm not crazy about the level of discourse that I see online in general,â she concedes. At the same time, she resists laying all of that at the feet of Facebookâs filter bubbles. âSince the early 70s, when you measure people based on their sentiments towards opposing political parties, itâs been kind of going up like thisâ&#8212;her hands fly upward and outward. âSo to the extent that thatâs a lot of the garbage thatâs on social media, thatâs reflecting whatâs in society.â</p>\n<p>Maybe Bickert has a point. But thereâs also a case to be made that Facebook, in trying to eradicate bad content, is locked in an unwinnable war with the world it helped create. After hastening the demise of the traditional news media by siphoning off much of its advertising revenue, then handing its platform over to whichever bottom-feeding blogs, shitposters, and fake-news profiteers could generate the most user outrage&#8212;well, of course, thereâs plenty of toxic speech for the company to remove. And while in the real world&#8212;or even on more rudimentary social-media platforms like Reddit&#8212;the power of robust counter-speech can do a lot to push back against noxious commentary, on Facebook, like-minded users are herded together by the self-sorting News Feed algorithm.</p>\n<p>I float the argument to Katsaros that, at least in the short term, the companyâs financial incentives <em>are</em> misaligned. One way to beat back the trash on its platform would be to plow its profits into building active detection tools and hiring more content moderators. Facebook, for example, has just four full-time fact checkers in Nigeria, a country of 200 million.</p>\n<p>âDidnât that happen?â Katsaros asks. âThe stock price took a huge hit.â</p>\n<p>Heâs right. It did. Last summer, after Facebook said it would invest in expanding its safety net, investors revolted. Which suggests â¦</p>\n<p>âAre you just saying that, like, capitalism is bad?â Katsaros asks. âIs that what youâre getting at?â He stares at me deadpan for a couple seconds, before a gallows-humor smile spreads across his face. âYeah. Definitely.â</p>\n<p>Next time I checked in with Katsaros, he had quit the company.</p>\n<p><strong>If Facebook</strong> has a commander in chief (Zuckerberg) and a legislative body (Bickertâs team), it recently decided to add a third branch of government. In November, Zuckerberg wrote a post signaling his commitment to establishing an external, independent board with the power to evaluate and override the companyâs most controversial decisions. In other words, Facebook would create a Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>The idea seemed gauzy and abstract&#8212;a Zuckerberg specialty. In fact, two people at Facebook have been planning the Supreme Court for more than a year. Andy OâConnell came to Facebook from the State Department, and Heather Moore joined from the Justice Department. Both work under Monika Bickert. OâConnell explains Zuckerbergâs motivation. âHis strong view is that all the content issues are issues for the community&#8212;that they are not motivated by business interests,â he says. âBut nobody believes that, of course.â The court would improve not just Facebookâs decision-making but also the âperception of legitimacy.â</p>\n<p>The task was daunting. Nobody has ever built a judicial system for a constituency of 2.3 billion people before. How many cases would it hear? Where would the judges come from? Would they be paid? Who pays them? Do deliberations take place over patchy Skype sessions? In a gargantuan mega-chamber, like the one used by the senate in the awful <em>Star Wars</em> prequels?</p>\n<p>As we discuss the idea in Building 23, OâConnell starts off by narrowing the courtâs jurisdiction. âThe way Iâm thinking about it,â he says, âitâs either really hard calls&#8212;things of significant public interest&#8212;or places where a novel case could cause us to reconsider a long-established policy.â That, in turn, leads to questions about how to choose the cases. Does Facebook pick? Do you let the public decide? âThen you get into all the, like, Boaty McBoatface public voting problemsâ&#8212;the unfortunate name Twitter users selected for a British research vessel.</p>\n<p>Moore chimes in. âAnd then, should that be a public decision, the way the U.S. Supreme Court makes a public decision?â Only about 4 percent of Facebookâs content is news. The rest is personal. So imagine a case involving bullying, or revenge porn. What implications would that have for the privacy of the users involved? Whether you find it heartening or terrifying that Facebook is happily working to improve its shadow government while the sclerotic real-world version in Washington does nothing, there is something thrilling about witnessing a society being built in real time.</p>\n<p>The week we meet, in late October, OâConnell and Moore decide to test-drive an early iteration of the court featuring a couple dozen âjudgesâ flown in from around the world, with backgrounds in human rights, privacy, and journalism. The session takes place in an airy conference room on a relatively secluded part of campus. The case I sit in on involves a piece of inflammatory content posted in Myanmar, where Facebook has been widely blamed for abetting the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims, by failing to remove attacks against them. While Facebook wonât allow me to report on the specifics of the case, I can say that the question before the judges is this: should the court overturn Facebookâs decision not to remove the offending content, which did not technically violate the companyâs hate-speech rules?</p>\n<p>The judges break off into small panels to debate the case. As Facebook staffers introduce contextual wrinkles that make the case harder to decide, the judges struggle to weigh two of Facebookâs own stated principles. Should the platform defend the âvoiceâ of an anti-Rohingya post? Or should it protect the âsafetyâ of those who were threatened by it?</p>\n<p>When the judges come together to issue a ruling, the vote is six to two to take the post down. Facebookâs decision, in the abstract, has been overturned. But given the complications of the case, nobody looks particularly satisfied.</p>\n<p>One of the ironies of Facebookâs efforts to clean up its platform is inherent in the framing of the problem. If itâs to be a benevolent government, why is it focused almost entirely on policing users? In addition to monitoring and punishing bad behavior, shouldnât it be incentivizing good behavior? In November, Facebook published a study by Matt Katsaros and three academics that sought to answer that question. Currently, when users post nudity or hate speech, they get a brief, automated message informing them of the violation and the removal of their content. Katsaros and his co-authors surveyed nearly 55,000 users who had received the message. Fifty-two percent felt they had not been treated fairly, while 57 percent said it was unlikely that Facebook understood their perspective. But among those who <em>did</em> feel fairly treated, the likelihood of repeat violations subsided.</p>\n<p>Based on the findings, the paper argued, Facebook should focus less on punishing haters and more on creating a system of procedural justice that users could come to respect and trust. After all, Facebookâs government may be a deliberative body, but itâs by no means a democratic one. Last year, for the first time, the company began letting users file an appeal when Facebook removed their individual posts. But now Katsaros is gone. So is his co-author Sudhir Venkatesh, who has returned to his sociology post at Columbia University after a two-year stint at Facebook.</p>\n<p>In late January, Facebook released a few more nuggets about the composition of its Supreme Court. The first iteration would likely feature 40 paid judges, serving on a part-time basis for three-year terms. The court would have the power to overrule Facebookâs content moderators, but not to rewrite the companyâs Community Standards. Little was said about the role or rights of the individual users who would be bringing their appeals to the high court.</p>\n<p>For now, the court is in Monika Bickertâs hands. At the conclusion of the session I attend, Bickert is piped in via video conference. Several judges comment that it would be a lot easier to resolve cases if they understood the motivations behind them. Bickert nods sympathetically. Facebookâs Supreme Court will be provided with plenty of context when it decides its cases. But there are only so many appeals it can hear. âThe reality is, with billions of posts every day, and millions of reports from users every day,â Bickert says, âitâs just not something that we can operationalize at this scale.â</p>\n<p>It was an outcome that Justice Louis Brandeis, the free-speech advocate, might have predicted. Brandeis was also an outspoken anti-monopolist, and Facebookâs critics often invoke him to justify breaking up the company. Even with an independent Supreme Court, it would seem, Facebook may be too big to succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>A couple weeks</strong> before the midterm elections, which Facebook is not accused of bungling, Bickert is playing a game. We are walking through a handsome Palo Alto neighborhood called Professorville, adjacent to Zuckerbergâs home neighborhood of Crescent Park. Itâs almost Halloween, and Iâve never seen so many extravagantly creepy yard decorations in my life. Home after home, locked in a bourgeois arms race to rack up the most realistically undead ghouls and animatronic skeletons. Accompanying us is Ruchika Budhraja, my Facebook P.R. minder and one of Bickertâs close friends at the company. The game is: How much does that house cost?</p>\n<p>The house weâre looking at is enormous: three stories tall, brownish with green trim, plus a wraparound veranda. Bickert appraises. âHmmm,â she says. âNine million.â I guess $8.25 million. Budhraja looks up the price on her phone. After a moment, the verdict. âIt says four and a half,â she informs us.</p>\n<p>What? That canât be right. Weâre standing in the middle of the most expensive real-estate market in the country. Bickert consults Zillow. âThis says 12.9.â Thatâs more like it. Budhraja pleads no contest. âI just googled on the Internet,â she says. Bickert shakes her head. âFake news.â</p>\n<p>This is a chancy parlor game to be playing with a journalist. A tech executive, playfully quantifying how her industry has turned an entire metro area unaffordable. But in the moment, it doesnât feel so tone-deaf. When Bickert marvels at the obscenity of Silicon Valley property values, you can tell itâs from a place of anthropological remove. This isnât really her world. She may be at Facebook, but she isnât of it.</p>\n<p>Because sheâs not a member of Facebookâs founding generation, sheâs not defensive about the companyâs shortcomings. And because sheâs freed from delusions of tech-sector altruism, she isnât precious about trying to make all of Facebookâs users happy. If the left wing of the Internet generally wants a safer and more sanitized Facebook, and the right wing wants a free-speech free-for-all, Bickert is clinging to an increasingly outmoded Obamian incrementalism. <em>Lead from behind. Donât do stupid shit</em>. Anything more ambitious would be utopian.</p>\n<p>âThe world is too diverse,â she says. âAnd people see speech so differently, and safety so differently. I donât think weâre ever going to craft the perfect set of policies where weâre like, âWeâve nailed it.â I donât think we ever will.â</p>\n<p>And one more thing: You still canât say, âMen are scum.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bill-weld-2020-republican-primary-challenge?inline\">mission to stop Trump?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Howard Schultz defends <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/howard-schultz-i-firmly-believe-americans-want-a-president-just-like-me?inline\">his controversial potential presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The suspected leaker of Jeff Bezosâs texts has his own <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/suspected-bezos-leaker-supplies-his-own-theory-about-the-affair?inline\">theory about the affair</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/kamala-harris-charlamagne-tha-god-inhaled?inline\">Kamala Harris did inhale</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The shocking details behind the double <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/abducted-in-plain-sight-netflix-jan-broberg?inline\">kidnapping of an Idaho teen</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"From the Magazine","socialTitle":"âMen Are Scumâ: Inside Facebookâs War on Hate Speech","socialDescription":"The company blew it on privacy and fake news.

Throwback but modern.â<br>\n&#8212; <strong>MILEY CYRUS</strong></p>\n<p>âI love how much Mark is all about the music&#8212;he is so passionate about creating something unforgettable.â<br>\n&#8212; <strong>ALICIA KEYS</strong></p>\n<p>âMark has always been brilliant. Heâs what you get when you combine immense talent with an unwavering commitment and work ethic.â<br>\n&#8212; <strong>SEAN LENNON</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Electric Lady Studios,</em></strong> <em>Greenwich Village, New York City</em>: From its inception, it was known as Jimi Hendrixâs Manhattan recording studio. In 1970 he converted a former club into a studio; the building was distinguished by a curved red brick wall on the outside and psychedelic murals on the walls inside. Many musicians have recorded here: the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, the Clash, J.Cole, Prince, Patti Smith, Kendrick Lamar, and numerous and legendary others. Today, Mount Sinai hospital has taken over part of the building; the curved brick wall is gone, and only one door identifies the historic recording studio. Inside, three flights up (no elevator), the musician-producer Mark Ronson is putting the finishing touches on a song heâll record the next day with the radio host Howard Stern. Mark has produced music for Amy Winehouse, Bruno Mars, Adele, Lady Gaga, Queens of the Stone Age, worked with Diplo, and others both numerous and legendary. So why is he doing a song with Howard Stern? Because, he tells me, he grew up in New York City as a fan of Sternâs early radio show; now he says that listening to him in the car in L.A. is one of the things that makes living there more bearable. Also, Howard asked him to do it.</p>\n<p>Mark Ronson is tall and handsome, with great hair in a dashing style that he claims he only washes and combs. Heâs wearing dark pants, vintage sneakers, and, most notably, a Heartbreakers T-shirt. Not Tom Pettyâs Heartbreakers but the 1970s Heartbreakers fronted by the late, former New York Dolls guitarist Johnny Thunders&#8212;beloved by fans of great, sloppy rock and roll. Mark, 43, lived in London until he was eight years old before moving to New York City. He would never have heard the Dolls or the Heartbreakers play live; both bands had broken up, and Thunders died of a rumored drug overdose in 1991. Still, game recognizes game: Mark grew up obsessed with mainstream rock (AC/DC, Guns Nâ Roses), rhythm-based funk, R&amp;B, and then rap, and heâs always had a feel for the real thing. Even before this past year, when he won Grammys, a Golden Globe, and the Oscar for âShallowâ from <em>A Star Is Born</em> (along with co-writers Lady Gaga, Andrew Wyatt, and Anthony Rossomando), Mark was considered a âgo toâ producer.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=gone-girl\"><iframe height=\"100\" width=\"350\" src=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=gone-girl\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>We sit on a leatherette sofa in the studioâs lounge, and he points to hundreds of Polaroid pictures on the wall, including one of his first manager, the late Dominique Trenier, who had been a contemporary of Andre Harrell and Sean âPuffyâ Combs. Mark comes from a musical family&#8212;as a child in London his parents always had music on in the house and parties where he would join in and play air drums. At age eight, following his parentsâ divorce, he moved to Manhattan with his mother and stepfather, Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones. Much has been made of Markâs family; his mother is the jewelry designer Ann Dexter-Jones, his twin sisters are designer Charlotte and D.J. Samantha, and there is a large extended family of other Ronson and Jones brothers and sisters. But anyone who knows Mark knows that this is beside the point; what is key to his entire being is how much he was, and is, in love with making music. As a teenager, he was in a variety of bands, some influenced by bands from the Black Rock Coalition, like Living Colour. He says he wasnât nearly as accomplished on guitar as his childhood friend Sean Lennon: âOne of my bands sounded like the Black Crowes, with a rapper on top,â Mark tells me. âOnly not as good as the Black Crowes.â He says he wanted to D.J. because he couldnât do what he wanted to do in that band. He was always determined and he always worked hard. After he got turntables and an MPC for his high-school graduation, he became obsessed with sampling and hip-hop. âMy drive was that I fucking loved this shit,â he tells me. âAny rapper Iâd meet in a club Iâd ask, âWant to come to my house and make some music?â In hip-hop, it wasnât so much where you were from, it was where you were at.â</p>\n<div class=\"callout group-2\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>Mark frequented clubs&#8212;but he wasnât some rich kid who sneaked into Studio 54 with his parentsâ gold membership card&#8212;he went to hip-hop joints. At age 17, he made $75 for his first D.J. gig, at a bar on Second Avenue. He recalls that it was during a snowstorm, he had to haul his own P.A. system, and he lost money on the job. He frequented Life, on Bleecker Street (now Poisson Rouge), where, back in the 1990s, the clubâs D.J. played dreamy, Euro music. Mark consistently begged the owner to let him D.J., and one night he took over the turntables. He played a combo of AC/DC and Chaka Khan, 70s soul, and Biggie, and, he says, âI decided I was just going to fucking kill it, and I donât think theyâd ever seen people dancing on the tables like that. It became my residency.â Quickly, his Friday-night sets became a <em>thing</em>. Among those who regularly stopped by to check him out: Rick Rubin, Jay Z, Chris Rock, Prince, Mariah Carey, Puffy, and others who, along with the fashion crowd, hired Mark to D.J. their parties.</p>\n<div class=\"callout large\" data-type=\"callout\"><p>âMy neuroses got me to where <em>I am, so fuck it</em>.â</p>\n</div><p>When Dominique Trenier âdiscoveredâ Mark at Life, he arranged for Mark to co-produce the 2001 U.S. debut album (<em>Everybody Got Their Something</em>) for Nikka Costa&#8212;a singer and the daughter of Frank Sinatraâs arranger-conductor Don Costa. Mark tells me he had no clue what to do in the recording studio, but he says that having been a D.J., being immersed in beat culture, and coming from a large family of colorful characters helped him learn how to produce records. The Nikka Costa album created a lot of hype, didnât sell very well in the U.S., but caused a stir in England, where his next project was a solo album (<em>Here Comes the Fuzz</em>) in 2003, which included contributions from Mos Def, Q-Tip, and others. That was followed by his album of covers, <em>Version</em>: âI wanted to make a Radiohead album with a James Brown vibe; I did it for my own enjoyment. The difference between my own records and records I produce for other people is that my solo records originate from a sonic or conceptual idea that Iâm inspired by&#8212;one that wouldnât make sense on anyone elseâs record.â His solo work got him noticed in England and eventually led him to work with the woman he calls âthe most iconic female artist of this generationâ&#8212;Amy Winehouse.</p>\n<p><strong>Mark better never</strong> lose his phone. His contacts include every major singer, musician, rapper, and sideman in the business. Ever since working with Amy Winehouse in 2006 on the multi-Grammy-winning <em>Back to Black</em>&#8212;with the exception of a period in 2011 and 2012 that he describes to me as a down, dark time (âI was partying too much, stumbling out of clubs like I was [Oasisâs] Liam Gallagherâ)&#8212;itâs been nothing but one amazing project after another. Among Markâs work was a 2018 tribute single for what would have been Michael Jacksonâs 60th birthday that combined several of the singerâs hits. (Mark didnât comment on the renewed allegations against Jackson of child molestation.) Heâs worked with musicians as diverse as Paul McCartney and Romy Madley Croft of the xx, and Queens of the Stone Age, whose leader, Josh Homme, says, âHe appreciates talented folks without trying to change, fix, or judge them. Heâs a positive guy&#8212;in attitude and optimism. Heâs a great musician across the board, but his skill is hiding his own.â</p>\n<p>Mark has a poker face that belies a dry, sardonic wit. He also is modest to the point of self-effacement. Heâs in therapy, which he says he likes, and admits to all sorts of anxieties. He tells me he used to think that every record he worked on would be his last. âThe day we won [the Grammy for] Record of the Year for âUptown Funk,â I thought, Oh god, this will never happen again; Iâve been faking it all along.â But now, he says, heâs getting better. âI donât have golden ears where I can tell a hit song. If you play me 10 songs and ask me which one Selena Gomez should record tomorrow, I wonât necessarily know. There have been times when I thought I didnât know what the fuck I was doing, but Iâll know it when I hit it. At some point, you get better about it and think, O.K., this is whatâs got me up to here, so maybe Iâm not so embarrassed or annoyed by my neuroses. I just have to accept that itâs part of me, embrace it, it got me to where I am, so fuck it.â</p>\n<p>So, Amy. Recalling the day they met in 2006, and the way they worked together, Mark says, âI think Amy was the first one who came around and said, âYou can do this on your own terms, you can do something thatâs exciting and a little bit left of center that can capture the mainstream.â She was influenced by jazz, all her chords came from jazz, and she would show me diagrams of chords.â At this point in our conversation, Mark shows me Amyâs handwritten lyrics to âBack to Blackâ (which he keeps under framed glass), with little hearts drawn in and the chords written out. âShe was totally straight when we worked together,â he says. âEveryone was telling me, âOh, youâre working with Amy Winehouse? Sheâs been working on that record for three years.â But I met her, and we started working that day. We did five songs in three days. She was like a honed, laser-sharp machine; I was lucky to meet her when she got sober, she had sorted herself out, and we just hit a vibe. The six songs I did with her were done in like 10 days. There was such an instant bond, and even though she was from North London, there was that humor, and that Jewish thing we both had. She would say, âYouâre the big sister I never wanted.â She was someone I could have been friends with for my whole life.â</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>âOne day we were walking,â he continues, âand she said she used to be pretty fucked up, and people would come to the house and thereâd be broken glasses and blood on the walls. And she said her dad and her manager came around and âthey tried to make me go to rehab and I was like no, no, no.â I told her that because she was talking about it with such distance, and this was such a heartfelt story, and there was something hook-y about what she just said, we should go back to the studio and try to write a song. So she went to the back room at Sorcerer Studios and came back with a two-bar blues, and of course my inner D.J. was thinking, Can we make it a little faster? She really is the only person I saw who could write a song in 40 minutes. She had no filter. I remember asking her on [the song] âBack to Blackâ to change a lyric because it didnât rhyme. And the thought of changing a lyric.â¦ Well, she wasnât indignant that I asked her, but it was like âHow could I change it? Thatâs what I <em>wrote</em>. How could I change it to make it rhyme?â And my pop brain was like, âWell, we do it all the time.â But she said, âThis is the emotion, this is what I <em>felt,</em> I canât change one word.â She was so honest, and I thought not everybody is so uncompromising and talented enough to do that.â</p>\n<p>After the massive success of that album&#8212;she won five Grammys and he won Producer of the Year&#8212;even though she went back to a drugged-up life, he says he never expected her to die. âI guess for all the drinking and partying Iâd done, Iâd never been close to someone experimenting with hard drugs. So I guess I was a little naÃ¯ve.â After that album, he had a bit of a downturn, between Amy and 2014âs âUptown Funkâ&#8212;the ubiquitous single with Bruno Mars that appeared on Markâs fourth solo album, <em>Uptown Special</em>.</p>\n<p>According to Mark, âI knew when I was doing that record that it had to be the best thing Iâd ever done or no one would care anymore. It could have been a song on Brunoâs record, but because I was in the middle of making my record, it ended up on my record. Iâm eternally grateful for that. And being able to go on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> with Bruno fronting that 2014 performance, obviously, for a minute, I was the luckiest sideman in the world. I know what I added to it, but is the bulk of it Bruno? Of course. Iâll be totally honest and say that Bruno wrote 75 percent of that song.â I ask if the song&#8212;which took seven months to make and is still played at basketball games, weddings, and anytime dancing is involved&#8212;made him super-rich. âNo,â he says, âbecause by the time you divide up the publishing between all the writers of the song [along with the inevitable lawsuit from someone who then gets added as one of the writers]â¦. I mean, of course we did O.K., and it gave me a platform in this country. I didnât have that in the U.S., because my solo success had all been in England. It gives you name recognition, leeway, and power for your next record. It gives you six years in the pop world to be relevant.â</p>\n<p>He adds: âBruno said the funniest thing. He said, âHow come every time itâs on the radio or on iTunes itâs Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars, and every time we get sued, itâs Bruno Mars featuring Mark Ronson?ââ</p>\n<p><strong>Mark tells me</strong> heâs never been romantically involved with any of the women heâs worked with: âIt seems like it would be a huge minefield,â he says. He describes himself as a romantic whoâs always been in long-term relationships. There was Quincy Jonesâs daughter, Rashida, who remains a good friend. In 2011, he married the model and actress JosÃ©phine de La Baume. In 2018 they got divorced, and he is reluctant to discuss what happened, saying they have a good relationship. And he adds, âItâs tough. We were together for eight years and married for five. Weâre two people who really love each other and had a history and the best of intentions, and it just didnât work out.â (A conversation follows between the two of us about how difficult it can be to maintain a marriage when someone is obsessed with work. How, during dinner, you could be thinking of getting back to the studio to fix a drum part, or a bass line that isnât quite right.) According to Sean Lennon, âMark often reminds me of a prizefighter or an Olympic athlete; heâs able to block out the world entirely in order to focus on a task at hand.â Mark says, âWhen Iâm on a project, I definitely go all in, and whatever effect it has on your life, for better or worse, Iâm fully immersed. But I think Iâve gotten a little bit better at figuring out when you can cut out. Instead of staying in the studio until 2 A.M., I can leave at 10 P.M.â He admits that heâs been seeing someone new, but didnât want to talk about it because he said it felt important and he didnât want to jinx it. He did say, however, with perturbed amusement, that the womanâs name (Rebecca Schwartz) wound up on his Wikipedia page; he has no idea who put that up there.</p>\n<div class=\"callout large\" data-type=\"callout\"><p>For his new album, âI had no choice <em>but to put my own honesty first</em>.â</p>\n</div><p>Mark executive-produced Lady Gagaâs 2016 album, <em>Joanne</em>, which led to co-writing the Oscar-winning song âShallow.â Mark tells me he went to see <em>A Star Is Born</em> thinking heâd rehearse a few non-partisan things to say if he didnât think it was amazing. But, he says, âI couldnât believe Iâd just spent seven months in the studio with her in extremely close quarters.... For someone whoâs one of the biggest pop stars in the world to be able to make you believe sheâs an unknownâ¦. I was instantly, fully <em>in</em>&#8212;the minute she was throwing the trash in the alley. Movies about music are usually done so badly, but this one got everything right. And for this song to be in the moral fiber of the movie, well, Iâm very grateful to be a part of it.â</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>Dua Lipa, whoâs working with Mark on her next album, says, âOne of the things I love about Mark is how he brings artists together and everything feels so collaborative.â And so, Markâs fifth solo album, <em>Late Night Feelings,</em> out in June, is marked by one amazing female vocalist after another. He describes the album as âa D.J. breakup record; itâs the most modern sounding record Iâve ever made.â He says the mood and the lyrics reflect the melancholy he feels about the breakup of his marriage. âThis album is all female vocalists, but it wasnât by design. I knew what I wanted to say on this record and you just find the people who are going to be your best sparring partners. People who were willing to go to the heartbreak zone a little bit. The difference between <em>Late Night Feelings</em> and my previous solo records is that this one came from an emotional place rather than a conceptual one. Itâs the first time I had no choice but to put my own honesty and realness first&#8212;instead of a kitschy or interesting concept.â</p>\n<p>However, from the first second of this album to the last, you cannot help but want to get up and dance: Markâs inner D.J. at work. Even the song Miley Cyrus sings, âNothing Breaks Like a Heart*,*â is a catchy, danceable tune. âI love the storytelling of country music, and thatâs what Mark does with his production and songs he writes and finds,â Miley says. âHe gave me my very own classic country song but with that twist that makes it work in clubs or on the radio. Heâs the master at that.â Lykke Li, who sings on the title track, says, âI think there is something about Markâs gentle spirit that unlocks vocals&#8212;especially female ones. Somehow we all channeled that heartbreak that is real in all of us.â The extraordinary gospel-based singer YEBBA, who sings three songs on the album, says, âMark puts together the most forgotten shades of my emotions. I swear I found my own reflection somewhere in the making of this project.â And King Princess (who is signed to Markâs own Zelig label) says, âMark is god, and I try to respect his opinions because I know he has great taste.â Additionally, Alicia Keys, Camila Cabello, Angel Olsen, Ilsey Juber, and Dodgr round out the all-female cast.</p>\n<p><strong>After many hours</strong> of conversation over two days at Electric Lady, Mark tells me: âIâm lucky that my real success didnât happen until I was older. Iâve been up and down, and I was lucky that my big success came when I was 32, so I knew I wasnât going to squander it away. Some of the things that have happened to me in music are beyond anything I ever could have imagined.â So, now that heâs checked off a lot of things on his wish list&#8212;<em>Saturday Night Live</em>, Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe, an Oscar, huge solo success, working with amazing talents&#8212;whatâs next? Well, he says, coming from a big family, he wants one of his own&#8212;so children will eventually be in the picture. But, he tells me, âas clichÃ©d as it sounds, my true heroes are people like Quincy Jones, whoâs made music thatâs meaningful in peopleâs lives for 30 or 40 years. The only thing I wake up in the morning and care about and want to do is to be in the studio getting that feeling again: to make a good piece of music.â</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why canât we get <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-documentary-the-inventor-hbo-gibney?inline\">enough Elizabeth Holmes?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Kellyanne and George Conwayâs cross-platform couples therapy is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/george-kellyanne-conway-twitter-feud?inline\">getting awkward</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; How the kids implicated in the college-admissions scandal <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/college-admissions-scandal-students?inline\">might save face</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Malcolm Gladwellâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/03/what-podcasting-with-rick-rubin-has-taught-malcolm-gladwell?inline\">very contrarian take</a> on creativity</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"From the Magazine","socialTitle":"Mark Ronson Is Ready to Make More Hits","socialDescription":"As the Grammy and Oscar-winning producer prepares to release his fifth solo record, he reflects on his collaborations with Lady Gaga, Amy Winehouse, and Bruno Mars, and his own new creative path.","seoTitle":"Mark Ronson Is Ready to Make More Hits","seoDescription":"As the Grammy and Oscar-winning producer prepares to release his fifth solo record, he reflects on his collaborations with Lady Gaga, Amy Winehouse, and Bruno Mars, and his own new creative path.","channel":"Style","subChannel":"","issueDate":"April 2019","ledeCaption":"<strong>SOUND DESIGN</strong><br>\nMark Ronson, photographed at his studio in Los Angeles.

The president was attacking the press; a friend who works in computer defense was telling him that America had just had its ass kicked by a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/russia-how-dare-you-drag-trump-into-our-election-meddling-crimes-mueller-report\">foreign power</a>. Things looked grim. And Boal, a journalist by trade, started obsessing.</p>\n<p>He flew to D.C., talked to pals who work in the national-security arena, and realized something stark: âThis was a huge, cataclysmic rupture that we all lived through,â he told me. âThere would be a lot of books written about it. A lot of articles. But the election, the whole complex of media and politics and counter-intelligence, it was in so many ways made for television. Maybe television would be the best medium to contain it.â</p>\n<p>Itâs now been two years since Boal <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/hollywood-trump-election-projects\">announced his intent</a> to jump, for the first time, into the small screen, with a multi-part series focused on the 2016 election, titled <em>Intelligence</em>. Now, after working with a team of investigative journalists including <strong>Hugo Lindgren</strong>&#8212;a former editor of <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> and current president of Boalâs company, Page 1&#8212;and traveling to locations from the U.K. to the Ukraine, the producer and writer of <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> is finally seeing his plans come into view.</p>\n<p><em>Intelligence</em> will be the first entry in an ambitious anthology Boal intends to use to examine major world events one season at a time, through the purview of the secret inner workings of power. Boal will show-run the 10- to 12-part series and partially direct it, partnering with Showtime Networks and Media Res, <strong>Michael Ellenberg</strong>âs company; the show will likely begin airing in 2020. (Boal calls Showtime &quot;class-leading,&quot; and says its current and upcoming slate&#8212;including the recent <em>Escape At Dannemora</em>&#8212;helped sway a competitive bidding process in the cable network&#39;s favor.) His frequent collaborator <strong>Megan Ellison</strong> will executive produce as well.</p>\n<p>I grabbed some time with Boal&#8212;who just formed a writersâ room, which includes, among others, <strong>Anna Deavere Smith</strong> (<em>Fires in the Mirror</em>) and Alan Poul (<em>Six Feet Under</em>, <em>The Newsroom</em>)&#8212;to discuss his new project.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Vanity Fair:</strong></em> The 2016 election and its aftermath is a huge, sprawling tale. What is the story you are telling?</p>\n<p><em>Mark Boal:</em> I think of it as the off-camera history of 2016. The theme of it is: everything you know about that time has gone through an industrial process of editing, and redacting, and shaping, and packaging. The show is ultimately about how truth gets manufactured in America. And the 2016 election is the frame for that theme, told through the eyes of many different characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are those characters?</strong></p>\n<p>I think of America as a real-world <em>Game of Thrones.</em> You have different kingdoms: the kingdom of the media, the kingdom of the F.B.I., the <strong>Hillary [Clinton]</strong> campaign, the <strong>[Donald] Trump</strong> campaign. Facebook and Silicon Valley are their own kingdom. Russia is a kingdom. There is this epic battle between those camps for control of the narrative, and for control of information and control of secrets. What weâre doing is giving you the droneâs-eye, 10,000-foot view of how those kingdoms fight each other.</p>\n<p>I spent time in each of those different kingdoms. I spent time with <strong>Chris Steele</strong> [the former British intelligence officer who wrote the dossier claiming Russia collected a file of compromising evidence on Trump] and Felix Sater [a Russian-American mobster who served as an adviser to the Trump Organization], to give you both ends of the spectrum. It will be a mix of people you think you know and people youâve never heard of.</p>\n<p><strong>Will Clinton or Trump be portrayed in the series?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no actor playing Trump or Clinton. But there will be actors playing real people. But this is not re-enactment. Itâs closer to <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> [which employed composite characters] than it is to <em>The People v. O.J. Simpson</em> [which had actors portraying public figures].</p>\n<p><strong>Are you suggesting that what you will be giving audiences is the truth?</strong></p>\n<p>I think what journalism gives you, at its best, is a list of facts, an assembly of facts. History gives you what happens. And art can give you the truth. There are tens of millions of people who are massively confused. The press holds some responsibility; so do politicians, and so does the intelligence community. The goal is to provide a sense of cohesion and clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of the intelligence community: there is going to be a fair amount of real estate in the series dedicated to the underlying espionage that was occurring at the time, correct?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. There was a massive intelligence failure, in that a foreign country managed to spin us into a state of complete fucking crisis. Thatâs a big part of the story. And not to say that itâs Russiaâs fault that some Obama voters went for Trump, or that itâs Russiaâs fault that certain [members of] the Obama coalition didnât hold up for Clinton. But you canât do 2016 without talking about spies.</p>\n<p><strong>From your research, and the research of the journalists you worked with, is there intelligence you have that hasnât yet been revealed?</strong></p>\n<p>There is a huge gap between what people see and hear in the process, and what actually went down inside those different kingdoms. Everything we know in this country is filtered through these different kingdoms. Trump puts one spin on it, which is fine. Obama puts another spin. The press puts their spin on it. And the F.B.I. puts its spin on it. Same can be said of <strong>[James] Comey</strong> and <strong>[Robert] Mueller.</strong> At the end of the day, itâs sort of left to artists to take a step back and say, âWhat does it all mean?â None of those groups are doing that.</p>\n<p><strong>With the new show likely to debut in 2020, and the onslaught of campaigning we will be under at that time, are you at all worried that audiences will be too fatigued by real events to tune in?</strong></p>\n<p>I think fatigue is the point. People are dog-tired from this kind of drip-drip-drip, where every day there is a new outrage and a new transgression. I think if everything is fine, and if people were fat and happy, there would be no reason to make the show. I think there is a high, pent-up demand for answers. I think what would be really hard would be to make a show that nobody gave a shit about.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212;The incredible story behind <a

And Wednesday has proven a good day for that last one&#8212;because the <em>Mad About You</em> reunion just landed at Spectrum.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mad-you-reunion-helen-hunt-paul-reiser-lands-at-spectrum-1192694\"><em>The Hollywood Reporter,</em></a> a revival of the NBC sitcom has just joined Charter Communicationsâ budding crop of Spectrum Originals&#8212;a slate that will also include the upcoming <strong>Gabrielle Union</strong>-<strong>Jessica Alba</strong> vehicle, <a href=\"https://www.spectrumoriginals.com/lasfinest/\"><em>L.A.âs Finest.</em></a> The show is currently set to debut later this year as a limited series.</p>\n<p>Both of the showâs original stars, <strong>Paul Reiser</strong> and <strong>Helen Hunt,</strong> will return to play married couple Paul and Jamie Buchman, while <strong>Peter Tolan</strong> (<em>The Larry Sanders Show</em>) will come aboard as show-runner. All three will executive produce the show, with <em>Mad About You</em> co-creator <strong>Danny Jacobson</strong> signing on as an executive consultant. The original series, which documented the romantic trials and tribulations of a newlywed couple, ran for seven seasons before it ended in 1999. Hunt, whose performance earned her four consecutive outstanding-lead-actress-in-a-comedy-series Emmys, is set to direct the reunionâs premiere.</p>\n<p>Spectrumâs head of original content, <strong>Katherine Pope,</strong> said in a statement that the team was thrilled to bring back <em>Mad About You.</em> âTwo decades ago, fans fell in love with this show, and this time will be no different as Paul, Helen, and Peter explore modern marriage through the eyes of two people who have just become empty-nesters,â Pope said. âWe canât wait for everyone to fall in love with the Buchmans all over again.ââ</p>\n<p>News of <em>Mad About You</em>âs impending return first broke <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/12/mad-about-you-paul-reiser-helen-hunt-revival/\">last spring</a>, but as <em>T.H.R.</em> reports, the revival struggled to find a home before Spectrum picked it up. Its landing spot means the showâs return is likely to make far fewer waves than some of its contemporaries, such as <em>Will &amp; Grace,</em> which enjoyed a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/will-and-grace-revival-season-9-premiere-ratings\">massive premiere</a> in 2017&#8212;before reboot-mania petered out&#8212;and ABCâs <em>Roseanne</em> reboot, which went on to become the No. 1 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/roseanne-number-one-television-show-2018\">show</a> of the year despite, or perhaps because of, all the controversy that surrounded it. Since then, however, things have begun to slow down, with <em>The Conners</em> drawing in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/the-conners-premiere-ratings-roseanne-barr\">respectable</a>, if less impressive, ratings, and series including CBSâs <em>Murphy Brown</em> revival underperforming. The announcement at the end of January that Netflixâs <em>Fuller House,</em> one of the first entries into the revival craze, had been renewed for <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/01/fuller-house-end-renewed-fifth-final-season-netflix-1202546263/\">its last season</a> seemed to mark the end of an era of sorts&#8212;adding yet one more reason not to expect too much of a frenzy around <em>Mad About You.</em></p>\n<p>But this reunion also drives home another factor: the absolute fragmentation of the content sphere. At this point, the <em>BoJack Horseman</em> story line in which a Web site called âwhattimeisitrightnow.comâ becomes a hub for original programming seems even less absurd than it did when Season 5 of that series launched last year (on Netflix, a company originally founded to send DVDs through the mail). At this point, any corporation with deep pockets can get into the content game&#8212;and while this is far from news, the fact that a classic NBC sitcom has landed with a cable provider does drive home how far that craze has gone better than just about anything else.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/10-undeniable-facts-about-the-michael-jackson-sexual-abuse-allegations?inline\">10 undeniable facts</a> about Michael Jacksonâs sexual abuse allegations</p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/bob-greenblatt-hbo-plepler-battle-with-netflix?inline\">new HBO</a>&#8212;and its coming battle with Netflix</p>\n<p>&#8212; <em>Captain Marvel</em> is a period piece, a space adventure, and an attempt at feminist filmmaking&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/captain-marvel-movie-review?inline\">and, our critic writes, it mostly succeeds</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Thought <em>Borat</em> was daring?

the actress said on Capitol Hill.","body":"<p><strong>Michelle Williams</strong> has taken her fight for equal pay to Capitol Hill. On Tuesday, the actress joined <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> to show her support for the Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation that aims to close the wage gap. In a short speech, Williams spoke about her own high-profile run-in with the issue last year, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/mark-wahlberg-michelle-williams-wage-gap\">when it was reported</a> that she made less than $1,000 to do re-shoots for the film <em>All the Money in the World</em>&#8212;while her co-star <strong>Mark Wahlberg</strong> made $1.5 million for the same work, even though both work with the same agency. In her speech, Williams recalled feeling âparalyzed [by] futilityâ after the news broke.</p>\n<p>âIâve been a working actress since the age of 12,â she continued. âIâve been accredited by my industry at the highest levels, and that still didnât translate to equal compensation.â</p>\n<p>The news of the <em>All the Money</em> pay gap originally went viral when <strong>Jessica Chastain</strong> asked Williams if she could share her story on Twitter. âJessicaâs audience was much wider than mine, and she wasnât afraid to pick up a megaphone and be heard. And heard she was. There was an uproar and a public shaming within my industry that resulted in a $2 million donation to the Timeâs Up Legal Defense Fund,â Williams said.</p>\n<p>After the uproar, Wahlberg <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/mark-wahlberg-donated-his-hefty-all-the-money-in-the-world-reshoot-salary-to-times-up-michelle-williams\">donated his re-shoot salary</a> to Timeâs Up, with WME adding an additional donation of $500,000. The change opened Williamsâs eyes to the staggering truth of the wage gap, she said on Tuesday: âIf it was like this for me, a white woman in a glamorized industry, how were my sisters suffering across their professions?â</p>\n<p>She also noted how the controversy transformed her experience at work. âWhen I went back to work after these events, I could tell my workplace was shifting,â she said. âRather than being grasped too tightly or hugged for too long as a morning greeting, my hand was shaken and I was looked squarely in the eye and I was welcomed to my Monday morning. I realized this is actually what it feels like to be on the inside. To be one of the boys.â</p>\n<p>The controversy also had another lasting impact: âOn the job I just completed two weeks ago,â Williams added, âlet me tell you something:  I was paid equally with my male co-star.â</p>\n<p>Itâs unclear which project she is referring to, but in a <em>Vanity Fair</em> cover story last July, Williams revealed that she was offered the same pay as co-star <strong>Sam Rockwell</strong> for the FX series <em>Fosse/Verdon</em>. âBefore I could even ask for it, they said, âTheyâve offered you what Sam Rockwell is making,ââ she said. âI cried.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212;The incredible story behind <a

A man named Joel heads out to work&#8212;then, realizing that heâs miserable, changes his mind and goes to Montauk. Itâs freezing cold and snowing&#8212;itâs February in New York&#8212;but he decides to walk the beach anyway so that he can write in his journal and mope in peace. âSand is overrated,â he thinks at one point, idly picking at his wet surroundings. âItâs just tiny little rocks.â</p>\n<p>On the beach, Joel sees a woman with blue hair, in an orange hoodie. He sees her again at a nearby diner, where he catches her spiking her coffee. He sees her again on the train platform headed back home&#8212;she playfully tries to get his attention&#8212;and again on the train itself, where she introduces herself as Clementine, defensively accosting him for not even knowing how to make fun of her name, the way everyone else apparently has. âWhy do I fall in love with every woman I see who shows me the least bit of attention?â Joel thinks. âIâm going to marry you,â says Clementine, aloud. âI know it.â</p>\n<p>They donât get married, but they do date. Joel, played by <strong>Jim Carrey,</strong> and Clementine (<strong>Kate Winslet</strong>) are the clashing, depressed, impulsive personalities at the center of <strong>Michel Gondryâs</strong> beloved 2004 movie, <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.</em> Only we donât experience their relationship in real time, following the linear rise and fall of the typical movie romance, with its structurally predictable melodrama. <em>Eternal Sunshine</em> certainly has the rise and fall, and more than its share of sincere, lovelorn melodrama. But per its by-now famous conceit, that story unfolds in retrospect, flashing up on-screen as itâs being erased from the loversâ memories bit by bit.</p>\n<p>Itâs a surprising, clever sci-fi twist, even as the relationship drama it dredges up doesnât feel at all like science fiction. A company named Lacuna Inc., staffed by the likes of <strong>Elijah Wood,</strong> <strong>Mark Ruffalo,</strong> <strong>Kirsten Dunst,</strong> and <strong>Tom Wilkinson,</strong> takes the objects you associate with the person you want to forget&#8212;pictures, gifts, anything thatâd stir up the pain of the relationship&#8212;and creates a map of the person in your mind. Then, memory by memory, Lacuna makes that person disappear from your past. Friends and neighbors get postcard notifications instructing them to never mention the ex-partner in your presence. And thatâs that.</p>\n<p>The movie, written by <strong>Charlie Kaufman</strong> (who won an Academy Award for his work in 2005), bears more than a superficial resemblance to Alain Resnaisâs 1968 masterpiece <em>Je Tâaime, Je Tâaime,</em> in which a loverâs death spurs a man to attempt suicide. He survives, and because he clearly has no will to live, he gets recruited for a dangerous scientific experiment in which heâs sent back in time one year, for a single minute. The experiment goes haywire; instead of reliving a single minute, he winds up reliving his entire fated romance, snippet by snippet, completely out of order, with no control over whatâs happening.</p>\n<p><em>Eternal Sunshine</em> has more humor and a more legible romance than Resnaisâs grimly nihilistic, harrowing classic, as well as tropes that speak to the moment of its release. Clementine, played with unusual vibrancy by Winslet&#8212;whoâd never get a role this quirky again&#8212;is very clearly a riff on the manic pixie dream-girl trope that haunted films of the aughts, though the term itself was not coined <a href=\"https://film.avclub.com/the-bataan-death-march-of-whimsy-case-file-1-elizabet-1798210595\">until 2007</a>. But sheâs also older than that archetype&#8212;both of the leads are. And her wild impulsiveness, a point of attraction for the usual dream girl, is here a bit more double-edged. Itâs this zany unpredictability, after all, that led to her deciding to erase Joel from her memory without a proper breakup. Nowadays, we call this ghosting; somehow, in 2004, it was harder to fathom.</p>\n<p>Itâs Joelâs own constant depression, meanwhile, that pushes Clementine to such extremes. Heâs the kind of guy who doesnât talk much because he thinks heâs got nothing going on&#8212;a sorta-funny sad sack whose creative energies seem stifled by the rigmarole of the everyday. A guy whose dissatisfaction seems incurable&#8212;a guy whoâs a little unbearable, in other words. The filmâs fascinating conjecture is that the manic pixie girl and indie hero probably arenât actually very well suited for each other&#8212;not because either one is a villain, but because of basic incompatibility. And yet they choose in the end to give their romance a shot anyway.</p>\n<p>Joel has more control over his hallucinatory encounters with the past than the hero of Resnaisâs movie. The boundaries are more porous; he can hear the technicians in his apartment, played by Ruffalo, Woods, and Dunst, chatting and smoking weed and talking shit. He can interact with Clementine; he can feel his memories slip away as they happen. These are the moments that make <em>Eternal Sunshine</em> so indelible, even 15 years on. Most of the movie plays out like a spotlit labyrinth of banal events that suddenly become radical and strange as faces, gestures, and details gradually start to disappear. A car falls from the sky; distinct events bleed into each other nonsensically. In Joelâs mind, Joel and Clementine being to run ahead of the memories once Joel realizes heâd rather have them&#8212;keep the pain&#8212;than pretend Clementine never existed.</p>\n<p>As heavy as <em>Eternal Sunshine</em> can get, it also never loses its puckish playfulness. Ruffalo and Dunst stoned in their underwear, jumping on Joelâs couch, remains one of the movieâs great joys; a scene back in Montauk, in which the memory of a house crumbles to bits with Joel and Clementine still in it, is still a harrowing, and fascinatingly literal, depiction of a mind being cracked open. Still, I suspect that we mostly remember the film for the serious questions it posits. The film is undeniably a fantasy.

But big layoffs at BuzzFeed and HuffPost show that the Webâs dominant companies canât be trusted to build a news business on.","body":"<p>If you live by Google and Facebook, you die by them. The loss of 1,000 mostly digital news jobs last week made that clear. The long death rattle of the newspaper industry is now being heard at digital news companies that only a few years ago were the shiny new stars of journalism.</p>\n<p>News that the layoffs had commenced arrived on BuzzFeedâs hip morning show on Twitter. The commentary, like the show, was short. âIt fucking sucks,â said one of the hosts, as the pink slips were beginning to be delivered near their set. BuzzFeed is shedding 15 percent of its 1,500-person staff, some 220 jobs. The same day, Verizon, the corporate overlord of HuffPost, announced big layoffs in its media division, including HuffPost journalists. The cuts will continue this week at BuzzFeed, which has already discharged its national-security team, its national desk, and its bureau in Spain. As if to emphasize that all were in the same boat, Gannett, venerable corporate parent of <em>USA Today,</em> laid off journalists at many of its regional papers across the country.</p>\n<p>Of the affected institutions, BuzzFeed is the one I know best, from extensive reporting I did there for my new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jill-abramson-dishes-about-new-media-and-her-tumultuous-times-years\">Merchants of Truth</a>.</em> BuzzFeed launched as a site catering to what its founder, <strong>Jonah Peretti,</strong> called the âbored at workâ network, millennials who were glued to their News Feeds when the boss wasnât around, sharing BuzzFeedâs adorable puppy pictures or answering its quizzes about 1980s celebrities. It moved into news in 2012 and aimed to compete with the old guard, <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post.</em> Its editor, <strong>Ben Smith,</strong> came from Politico.</p>\n<p>The journalists who were laid off at BuzzFeed and HuffPost were different from those of the standard-issue <em>Times</em> or <em>Post</em> model, both generationally and in terms of approach. HuffPostâs new editor, <strong>Lydia Polgreen,</strong> who herself had come from the <em>Times,</em> aims to cover the news as it impacts real people, an approach that is refreshing given the unitary focus on politics and President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> that most news shops have had recently. And, as digital natives, they understood the power of the Web in the way others didnât. Two BuzzFeed journalists were ferreting out âfake newsâ earlier than most news organizations, exposing teens in Macedonia who were making a fortune on advertising by promoting their fake news sites on Facebook. The journalism can be excellent: BuzzFeed was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize for an investigation of the Russians who were behind 14 suspicious murders in Britain.</p>\n<p>Perettiâs belief was that BuzzFeed couldnât be a serious media player without a major commitment to serious journalism. He gave Smith the money he needed to compete and bring a younger audience to hard news. I viewed BuzzFeed as a genuine competitor when I was executive editor of <em>The New York Times.</em> And with the Trump administration, there cannot be too many investigative or national-security reporters. BuzzFeedâs news side had 20 journalists in its investigative unit alone.</p>\n<p>In their heyday, places like HuffPost and BuzzFeed looked like they had figured out a sustainable business model by building audience scale and attracting lots of digital advertising. Old media envied them and resented their success. HuffPost rode the Google search wave, mainly by figuring out the digital science of search-engine optimization. BuzzFeed rode the social wave and attached itself to Facebook. Its snackable, shareable content was manna to advertisers.</p>\n<p>Peretti is the thread that connects them. He was one of the founders of the Huffington Post and figured out how to make its stories and blogs, mostly written by unpaid authors and celebrities in <strong>Arianna Huffingtonâs</strong> Rolodex, rank at the very top of Google searches. At the <em>Times,</em> I was horrified every time one of our big scoops was virtually copied by Huffington and drew more eyeballs than our originals, courtesy of ranking higher on Google.</p>\n<p>In 2011, Arianna sold the Huffington Post at the top of the market. It was acquired by AOL for $315 million (Verizon later acquired AOL, and with it, HuffPost). Arianna departed in 2016, having pocketed two acquisition windfalls. Peretti used some of his millions to launch BuzzFeed, which began life in a crummy, roach-infested office above a mah-jongg parlor in Chinatown. He wanted to apply what he had learned at the M.I.T. Media Lab about how information goes viral, and see if a Web site could thrive by employing the new Web science of virology.</p>\n<p>I got to know Peretti in 2011 and invited him to appear with me onstage at a <em>Times</em> meeting of its top executives and editors. We were very far behind in using social media to distribute our stories and build audience (we used to use the term âreaders.â) The <em>Times</em> had always been reluctant to give its stories away, worrying that it would anger subscribers if the journalism they paid for appeared free elsewhere on the Internet. Soon, though, the <em>Times</em> could not resist the lure of 2 billion users and provided news content for Facebookâs instant articles, video for Facebook Live, and encouraged its reporters to do live Facebook chats.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, BuzzFeed, riding along on the river of Facebookâs audience, continued to grow. By 2017, it had a $1.7 billion valuation&#8212;but that year it missed its revenue targets. In 2018 it expected to hit a $300 million target, but cutting bodies may have been required to reach that goal. Its high valuation makes it an unlikely acquisition prospect. A public offering was talked about but shelved.</p>\n<p>Facebookâs News Feed, and the algorithms which underly it, are the environment in which BuzzFeed and companies like it thrive or wither. When Facebook pronounced itself âvideo first,â so did BuzzFeed, which received a $250 million investment from NBCUniversal to make video programming. Peretti moved to Los Angeles, rented out some massive warehouses, and built something called BuzzFeed Studios. I went out to see a big and expensive production studio, a mini&#8211;Paramount Pictures.</p>\n<p>But Facebook is fickle. When it tweaked its almighty algorithm to decrease the appearance of news in the News Feed and prioritize friends and family, it hit news companies hard. Meanwhile, with Google, it was gobbling up 95 percent of new digital ads. That created the current crisis. For BuzzFeed, as for other digital publishers who had become dependent on Facebook traffic, things did not work out as expected. The âpivot to videoâ that so many digital media companies copied, has become, as one journalist called it, âthe pivot to dust.â In January, Netflix canceled its BuzzFeed series, <em>Follow This,</em> which followed BuzzFeed journalists as they worked. Mic, another digital news operation with a young audience, shuttered itself a few months ago, shortly after its own full pivot to video. Closure came after Facebook canceled Micâs program on Facebook Watch.</p>\n<p>In the wake of all this turmoil, Peretti, too, has become a Facebook critic. At the Code Conference in Huntington Beach, California, he said, âThe big question with Facebook is most of Facebookâs revenue is in News Feed, and thatâs where theyâve not shared revenue.â Together, Facebook and Google have sucked up $95 billion of new digital ad revenue. Peretti has proposed merging with other digital companies, including Vox, Vice, and others, to force Facebook to share the wealth.</p>\n<p>Itâs possible that these new cuts are happening because BuzzFeed is slimming itself down in hopes of a sale. Smith had already talked to <strong>Peter Lattman</strong> of the Emerson Collective about a possible deal for BuzzFeedâs news operation, but it never came together. Last week, Recode reported that BuzzFeed might merge with Group Nine&#8212;digital publisher and producer of Thrillist, NowThis, and the Dodo&#8212;which is run by the son of BuzzFeed chairman <strong>Ken Lerer.</strong></p>\n<p>Iâm not sure any of these places will exist independently in five years. In newspapers and on the Web, only the big, and the essential, will survive. <em>The New York Times, The Washington Post,</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> are certain to survive. They are our irreplaceable news providers. But the shrinking of BuzzFeed and Huffpost, the continuing decimation of the dead-tree brigades, and associated scandals of fake news, loss of privacy, and rabid polarization, have made clear that the current media regime is in crisis, to which attention must be paid. How much bigger will Google and Facebook be in five years? The word âanti-trust,â is beginning to circulate in Washington. Weâll see.</p>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"How Google and Facebook Strangled Their Digital Offspring","socialDescription":"The conventional wisdom used to be that digital natives were the only journalism businesses that would thrive.

Buzz Saw","dek":"What made Facebook think this was a good idea?","promoDek":"What made Facebook think this was a good idea?","body":"<p>Another day, another privacy controversy for Facebook. This one comes after TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/\">reported</a> Tuesday that the company had paid users as young as 13 years old to install an app on their phones that tracks all their activity, as part of a research effort to âgather data on usage habits.â Facebook had been paying the teenagers and adults $20 per month to install the Facebook Research app since 2016&#8212;a matter the social-media giant confirmed to the publication, even as it denied the program ran afoul of Appleâs rules. âThere was nothing âsecretâ about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App,â a spokesperson for the company said after the report. âIt wasnât âspyingâ as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate.â</p>\n<p>Still, revelations about the years-long research effort will exacerbate privacy concerns about Facebook after years of scandals surrounding Russiaâs interference in the 2016 election, Cambridge Analytica, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-hack-data-breach.html\">major security breach</a>, and Facebookâs <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/FacebookPrivacyScandal\">handling of usersâ data</a>. The timing of the data-for-cash debacle is particularly brutal. Facebook had just launched something of a rehabilitation campaign, featuring an <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/can-sheryl-sandbergs-apology-tour-restore-facebooks-image-and-stock-price\">apology tour</a> by <strong>Mark Zuckerbergâs</strong> second-in-command, <strong>Sheryl Sandberg.</strong> Whatever momentum Sandberg had, however, would seem to be undercut by the revelation that Facebook was paying teens to spy on them. The optics are particularly terrible following the outcry in the media and Silicon Valley over the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03126-x\">adverse impact</a> social media has on childhood development. (âGod only knows what itâs doing to our childrenâs brains,â <strong>Sean Parker,</strong> the founding president of Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/sean-parker-unloads-on-facebook-god-only-knows-what-its-doing-to-our-childrens-brains-1513306792-f855e7b4-4e99-4d60-8d51-2775559c2671.html\">exclaimed</a> in 2017. Apparently, Facebook was eager to find out.)</p>\n<p>Facebook, trying to stay on the offensive, told TechCrunch that less than 5 percent of participants were teens, and that they had signed parental-consent forms. The company also reportedly told TechCrunch that it will shut down the app on iOS version. (Facebook will allegedly continue to run the program on Android.) But a great deal of damage may already have been done to Facebookâs relationship with Apple, which swiftly revoked the license for the program, citing a âclear breach of their agreement.â</p>\n<p>Apple, of course, is presumably all too happy to see Zuckerberg stumble. With public sentiment turning against data-hungry companies like Facebook and Google, Apple C.E.O. <strong>Tim Cook</strong> has staked Appleâs reputation on its ability to protect user privacy. He has also, at times, twisted the knife in Zuckerbergâs back. âWeâre not going to traffic in your personal life,â he pledged in March, taking a dig at Facebook. âPrivacy, to us, is a human right. Itâs a civil liberty.â (Zuckerberg was apparently so enraged that he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\">ordered his management team</a> to only use Android phones from then on.)</p>\n<p>Another opportunity to contrast itself with Facebook, therefore, is a win for Apple&#8212;and, potentially, an opportunity to win market share from a <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/30/zuckerberg-says-imessage-biggest-competitor-to-facebooks-messaging-services-takes-dig-at-apples-china-policies\">major competitor</a>. âWe designed our Enterprise Developer Program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization,â an Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch. âAny developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.â</p>","rubric":"Facebook","socialTitle":"Zuckerberg Stumbles into Appleâs P.R.
