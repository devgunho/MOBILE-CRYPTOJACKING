At the same time as making the request, the applicant shall inform any national or international information center referred to in <a href="#P474_91988">paragraph&nbsp;(2)</a>.</p>
<p><a name="P474_91988" id="P474_91988"></a>(2) If the owner of the right cannot be found, the applicant for a license shall send, by registered airmail, copies of his application, submitted to the authority competent to grant the license, to the publisher whose name appears on the work and to any national or international information center which may have been designated, in a notification to that effect deposited with the Director General, by the Government of the country in which the publisher is believed to have his principal place of business.</p>
<p><a name="P475_92497" id="P475_92497"></a>(3) The name of the author shall be indicated on all copies of the translation or reproduction published under a license granted under <a href="#P421_79913">Article&nbsp;II</a> or <a href="#P447_86233">Article&nbsp;III</a>.
