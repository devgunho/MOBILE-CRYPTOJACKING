&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Welcome</b> to <b>eyezware</b>. I host custom, bash, shell scripts, all different; Some
just for fun, some more useful. Each script has its own project page and comment system, which I hope you'll use for useful feedback.
My old site was <b>eyez-Observe</b>, which was also hosted by Daniel, at <b>zj6dtirxj543frww.onion</b>. Although I do still have the
site backed up, I thought it was a good time to rebuild and get my own permanent URL RSA, so that I can keep the same URL if anything
should happen to <i>this</i> site. I also wanted a custom name showing in the URL. I've kept the same color scheme,  but there is
less content than there was at the old URL. That is good though, as I can concentrate more on bash scripting, instead of spreading
myself so thin. Also, since I made <b>AViator</b> (now a deb file), I've seen little need to keep maintaining a live playlist, since
you can get your own playlists with ease from any paste site. Also there are channel functions to AViator now too, so it is simple to
keep the ones you like, even if you only have the web URL, as Streamlink and YouTube-DL take care of the dynamic media URL problem.
You can't save a media URL, if it isn't permanent and most aren't, but the web URL that indexes the media file usually stays the same,
giving us something to add to our channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last site had <b>AutoConnect</b> and some very similar scripts within it. If you are looking for it, I am just
posting those under the name <b>Vanish</b> now. I will, simply, post notes on dealing with static connections and apps that always get
your new IP, in comments within the main script, Vanish. There are other scripts I host here that Vanish calls on, like <b>SUcmds</b>
and <b>VPNexclude</b> and I also host usable <b>lists</b> for those scripts to use. In case you are wondering, those lists are for
grabbing <b>random information</b> and using it to repopulate certain fields in conf files, every time certain scripts are run. Vanish,
itself, is for getting a <b>random VPN connection</b> (you must acquire your own VPN accounts/VPS). It also <b>listens in real time</b>
for any connection changes and immediately <b>kills all networking</b>, then <b>reconnects to a new VPN</b> server, with all new random
info, <b>including MAC address</b>. The MAC is completely random at default. You will have to change the method a bit to emulate actual
hardware IDs. This falls in compliance with, what I call, the <b>FU method</b>. I suggest you check the project page, for more info, if
your interested. For reference, the FU method of anonymity does not clone you, but instead gives you a new uniqueness, each time.
Please let me know of a web broswer project, if they have similar goals, as I would like to include one into my FU method of connecting.
At the moment, FireFox with certain plugins is the best I can suggest right now to randomize settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every script is so practical though. I also have a few things for fun, like different types of <b>animated
wallpaper</b>, but even this can have a practical purpose. Click a button and have your (favorite?) webcam showing live images as your
wallpaper in <b>XFCE4</b>. A few simple tweaks can have it running in <b>other environments too</b>. Maybe you are always checking the
terminal for output. It is nice to see system messages or netstat <b>output</b> or any other command you are always running as the
<b>desktop background</b>. Maybe you always wanted an animated <b>gif as wallpaper</b>, but gif doesn't animate as a desktop background.
If you "explode" the gif with a simple, single command, you can essentially have, the gif as wallpaper. I mean it. It <i>is</i>
wallpaper. Not like the numerous things I tried that claimed to be wallpaper, but in reality, just showed as a fullscreen picture,
covering my desktop entirely, though some are known to work in other environments. I had no choice, but to create my own for them to
work as I had anticipated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even scipts that look easy to dismiss were made for a purpose, like <b>Screenshot-XFCE4</b>. Sure there are tons
of screenshot apps, but this one does something special and works well with the <b>live webcam wallpaper</b> scripts, for instance. If
you use certain "wp" scripts from this site, you may want to check it out, as it copies the background source picture at its original
resolution, rather than snapping an actual screenshot at your navive one. Even the <b>backup scripts</b> were made for a reason. I
couldn't find an all in one solution for backing up everything. GUI apps have issues dealing with <b>root files</b>, no backup app had
support for all my <b>online storage</b> (which most goofballs call cloud now), none gave easy access to individual files and some
even changed my file permissions. Once started, it's <b>automatic</b>, till finished. You will have to edit it to match your file
locations, initially, keeping diskspace in mind and dealing with root files means a small configuration to sudoers; small, but not
taken lightly, but of course, root files are optional and a different script is called on withink bk-all,which is easy to uncomment,
called <b>bk-core</b>. Find it in the left menu if it interests you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned other unfinished scripts in the past that I would still like to complete, like my <b>Network
Intrusion Detection System</b>. That was a bit complicated for me before, but I am getting more comfortable with bash all the time.
Another script I am excited about, <b>HashCrack</b>, is more for fun, but it actually could be of use too, especially if you know
<b>any part of the original string</b> you are trying to solve for. Other information can help a lot too. I hope you like smart ass
comments because I intend to fill HashCrack with them. They help to make a <b>completely improbable</b> task a bit more interesting.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that aside, AViator is my main project and will require more attention as I intend on setting up an <b>apt
repo</b> for it as well as <b>submitting it to Debian and other apt capable OSes</b>, which brings me to my next point; I needed an
official project page to use for "upstream" development, which means <b>mirroring this site to Cleanet</b>. I hope that it will draw
more people to use Tor and see that <b>not all onion sites are bad news</b>. AViator is now available as a <b>deb file</b>. You can
find it on its project page to the left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, the links (<b>Lynx</b>) are self contained on their own page now, but they are still here.
<b>Search inputs</b> are there now too. It is a great <b>homepage</b> for those that like to scour the net. It's clutter free and
has periodic <b>response code checks</b> that are reported, as well as a <b>legend of the symbols</b> used for quick reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the peace, protect your loved ones and keep your eyes open and most importantly; Don't be a zombiebot NPC
or we are all bound to naively follow, with our...<br>
