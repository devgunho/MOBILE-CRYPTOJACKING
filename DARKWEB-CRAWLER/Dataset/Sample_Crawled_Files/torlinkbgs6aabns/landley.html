<a name="31-12-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#31-12-2009">December 31, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Happy new year.  I haven't done anything worth blogging about it a week.
(I've <a href=http://twitter.com/landley>twittered</a> but that's a service
_designed_ for having very little to say.  Sort of the point of the thing,
really.)</p>

<p>I have to <a href=notes-2009.html>move the blog file</a> and
<a href=notes-2010.html>start a new one tomorrow</a>.  
(Actually what I have to move is the "notes.html" symlink to point to
the new file.  And possibly I should start making the suckers so
the date is a <a href="#31-12-2009">link to the individual post</a>...)</p>

<p>Or just use a real blogging service.  Can't quite bring myself to make
<a href=http://landley.livejournal.com>my old livejournal</a> important
again now that the russian mafia owns it.  But the span tags I've been
putting in the entries don't show up in the rss feed, and every time I ponder
doing something about that it always brings up the fact there's no comments
and no individual entry URLs (beyond the hash tags)...</p>

<p>I dunno, what blogging services out there these days are worth using?</p>

<a name="28-12-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#28-12-2009">December 28, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Wow, am I an agnostic.</p>

<p>I just added somebody to my spam filter over an argument about a tecnical
topic, and not even because I particularly disagree with him (the approach he
takes works fine for his use case).  It's that he was arguing that what he'd
chosen to do was a One True Way, conflating together a half-dozen different
choices that are in reality orthogonal, insisting his personal preferences
were universal truths... and I just don't want to argue with
people like that anymore.  It's no fun.  Possibly I used up my current stock
of patience in last week's LWN thread, dunno.</p>

<p>Christmas came and went, New Year's approaches, it's the holiday week
between the two and I've been sleeping for 11 hours a night.  Not quite
sure why, just tired all the time.  (Fade points out the time of year.
If I do wind up in Dublin I'm going to need big flourescent lights, right
next to my desk.  Yeah, that's still an if.)</p>

<a name="25-12-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#25-12-2009">December 25, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Merry Christmas!  Watched a festive holiday movie (Groundhog's Day),
opened presents, cooked an enormous roast...</p>

<p>I have been _massively_ slacking off due to the holidays.  Haven't
made any progress on any computer related things since last week.
(In part because my current FWL thingy is trying to cut a gordian knot of
complexity that I'm writing an explanation of for the mailing list, but
mostly because it's christmas and I just want to relax and enjoy it.)</p>

<p>Wrote up a status report on FWL, and then <a href=http://lists.impactlinux.com/pipermail/firmware-impactlinux.com/2009-December/000549.html>moved it
to the mailing list</a> instead.</p>

<p>Sigh.  Back in the 90's I found a marvelous orange bread recipe on
Ye Olde Internet, which was accidentally vegan.  (The whole "that carrot has
been murdered, I must go straight edge on you now" aspect was incidental,
I liked that it was actually _good_.)  I dug the recipe up out of a box
again years later and it was still marvelous, but alas it seems long lost
since sometime before the move to Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>What I really remember about it is it was trivial to make.  The main
ingredients were flour and orange juice, with a bit of salt and baking
powder/soda.  (I still can't quite keep those straight.  Possibly both.)
Oh, and a teaspoon or so of lemon juice, optional.  There might have been
a little sugar, although the orange juice had rather a lot already.
I do remember that the only liquid ingredient was the juice.  (No eggs, butter,
oil, shortening, or anything like that.)  Also, no yeast.  (It was important
not to stir it too much, you just fold the mixture over once or twice
until it's wet and then _stop_stirring_.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, attempting to google for this recipe keeps bringing up
pages and pages of irrelevant crap.  No grated peel, no nuts, no bananas,
no pumpkin, no cranberry.  No milk, no chunks of fruit.</p>

<p>By the time I've put in all those filters, I think I broke Google's
brain.  I'm now getting a video recipe for "Frog's Eye Salad", a page
about "Catsup Cake Flour" (?), A PDF from a state.tx.us page that
claims to be a tax publication but apparently contains a grocery list,
a recipe for "Orange Roughy Roll-ups with Creamy Dill Sauce" (if that
has any relation to fruit roll-ups, I'm going to pass, thanks),
fondue recipes, "Holiday Baking with Whole Grains", and a page from
the North Dakota Wheat Commission.  That's all in the first two pages
of results.</p>

<p>I suspect my best option is to just fiddle around and try to recreate
this stuff by trial and error.  Except I don't currently have any orange
juice.</p>

<p>Wow.  After I stopped directly replying to His Specialness over on lwn
(because it just wasn't accomplishing anything), and then later stopped posting
to the lwn.net thread at all (well, except for <a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/367938/>this</a>) when Jonathan Corbet (editor of Linux Weekly News)
<a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/367517/>asked us to stop</a>.  (Then I fell
behind on email and twitter for a couple days because it's christmas and I was
busy, so I'm just catching up now.)</p>

<p>But other people didn't stop posting, and I still get emailed the replies
to replies because I checked the little boxes, and apparenty His Specialness
has decided that anyone who disagrees with him
<a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/367860/>must really be me in disguise</a>.</p>

<p>I find that hilarious.  When have I ever been reluctant to
<a href=http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2006-September/058617.html>insult
him to his face</a>?
The only reason I've stopped using His Specialness's name is I think
he's a glory hound on the order of those white house party crashers,
balloon boy's parents, and that toupee that used to govern
Illionis.  Getting his name repeated seems to be what he wants, with context in
which it's repeated a very distant secondary consideration.  I suspect
the only reason he hasn't done one of those reality television shows where
you eat a bug on camera is they wouldn't take him.</p>

<p>LWN doesn't seem to have user profiles, so out of morbid curiosity I spent
the 30 seconds to type "site:lwn.net syspig" into google, which found
<a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/211071/>a comment from 2006</a> on its first
page of hits.  His Specialness apparently did not bother to do this.</p>

<p>I repeat my comment from the last big post I made to the thread before the
moratorium: "<a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/367521/>I'm tired of arguing with
people who don't bother to do their homework</a>".  (And I note yesterday's
squirrel analogy on the difference between clever and smart.)</p>

<a name="22-12-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#22-12-2009">December 22, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Yesterday at the mall there were tons of banners for this clear.com thing,
and today I clicked on a web ad for 'em, because I'm all for any alternative
to Time Warner (which needs to die on general principles because they keep
trying to <a href="#01-04-2009">retroactively sneak usage limits into their
contracts</a>), and these guys look like they've got reasonable plans with
no usage caps... if you can find them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their web site was designed by somebody who thinks that
clicking through five pages to answer a simple question somehow improves
matters, and that all pages should be generated by javascript based on
cookies so that when you finally DO dredge an interesting piece of info out
of their navigational morass, you can never actually get a URL directly to that
page so you can send said URL to someone else.  (Oh, and two of the pages I
tried to visit had firefox bring up a "redirect loop detected" page, that was
nice.)</p>

<p>It's a very _pretty_ website.  Lovely plumage.</p>

<p>They had a "live chat" service which was answered by a very nice lady
who was very polite, gave prompt replies... and didn't actually have any new
information to give me.  (She was looking stuff up on the website for me,
and apparently she couldn't find some of it either.)</p>

<p>Hopefully if I come back in a month their teething troubles will have
worked through, their support people will be more experienced, and maybe
they'll have burned their existing website to the ground and replaced it
with something that doesn't spend all its effort on being clever and none
of it on being smart.  (I can hope.  When squirrels hide nuts so ingeniously
they can't find them again, they're being clever but not smart.  It's
less cute in a large corporation.)</p>

<p>Ok, the FROM_ARCH, FROM_HOST, CROSS_HOST, and CROSS_TARGET stuff is
once again TOO CONFUSING.  It works, and it was worked out laboriously
via extensive trial and error, but it's too nasty and tangled for me to
keep it straight in my head, and I wrote it.</p>

<p>Let's see...</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
if CROSS_HOST is blank, it's $(uname -m)-walrus-linux
if CROSS_TARGET is blank, it's $ARCH-unknown-lilnux
  if CROSS_TARGET is set by an arch dir (such as powerpc-440fp),
  then FROM_HOST=$CROSS_TARGET
if FROM_ARCH is blank, FROM_ARCH=$ARCH
if FROM_HOST is blank, FROM_HOST=$FROM_ARCH-thingy-linux
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, FROM_ARCH defaults equal to $ARCH.  (Probably $ARCH should just be
called $TARGET these days.)  This is blanked for the binutils/gcc/ccwrap stages
when we're building a simple cross compile.  It's set to the host for
static builds (currently hardwired to i686), and then set equal to the target
arch for native builds.</p>

<p>That's overcomplicated because the toolchain build and root filesystem
stuff is glued together.  Setting it to the toolchain host for cross and
native builds makes sense, but the "default equal to $ARCH, except when it's
blank" bit is crazy.  There should be some way to signal we're building a
simple compiler, but overloading FROM_ARCH seems a bit silly.</p>

<p>FROM_HOST is derived from FROM_ARCH, and overriden by CROSS_TARGET under
magic circumstances.  That's a mess, and I believe it's a mess for binutils.
Vaguely recall much pain last time I fiddled with this, and this is just where
I left off because it was SUCH a mess.</p>

<p>CROSS_HOST exists solely to humor the binutils and gcc builds, because the
people who wrote that are crazy.  It's always `uname -m`-walrus-linux.  It's
proof positive that autoconf is useless because it' can't figure out what
the current system it's running the build on is, and must be told,
and if I can't figure out how to remove it I think I'm going to hardwire it
into the call sites.</p>

<p>Sigh.  Attempting to clean up the multi-variable mess while separating the
toolchain build from root-filesystem.sh (and unify it with cross-compiler.sh)
turned into a large mess.  I need to do this in stages, but it's all tangled
together.  Where to start...</p>

<p>Today's wastes of time,

<a href= <a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/367501/>and
of course this</a>.</p>

<p>(I am amused that the LWN articles about things I've done all have titles
about whatever the project du jour is, from the "patch penguin" stuff through
"busy busy busybox", but all the ones about a certain extra-special
developer have his name as the title.  Shows what our respective priorities
are, doesn't it?)</p>

<p>I've also been asked why I didn't complete the forensic study years ago.
(Christian Michon suggested I use "git blame").  The thing is, I vaguely
recall I _did_ complete it, and found nothing of interest, but never bothered
finishing the write-up because Mr. Special had gone away, which was the point
of the exercise.  (These days I'm out of it, and when he's not breathing
down my neck he's simply not worth any effort.)</p>

<p>(Also, git blame isn't that great a forensic tool, because if you change
the whitespace or a single variable name in a line, blame will show the newer
commit but the line is still substantially similar to the previous line.
I was trying for a deeper read into the code than that.)</p>

<p>Cleaning continues.  Found a bunch of old t-shirts I like in one of Fade's
big foot locker chest things, stuff I haven't seen since Pittsburgh.  (It's
like shopping without having to spend money or go find stuff I like in piles
of stuff I don't.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>I'm trying to break the toolchain generation out of root-filesystem.sh
and give it its own script.  Right now, build.sh can do up to four toolchains:
the simple cross compiler, the static cross compiler, the static native
compiler, and the dynamically linked native compiler that's part of the
final root filesystem.</p>

<p>In theory, that should all be factored out into a single "build a
compiler" script that can do all four variants based on config flags.
In practice, the root filesystem might need to build uClibc even if it
hasn't got a compiler, if stuff in it is dynamically linked.  (But in
that case it just needs the *.so files, not the *.a or *.o files or
the headers.  And don't get me started on libgcc_s.so.)</p>

<p>I suppose the static native compiler and the dynamic native compiler
could be collapsed together.  Static linking against uClibc isn't much
overhead and we're talking 13 megabytes of compiler and headers and such
already, so micro-optimizations are at the wrong scale to matter.</p>

<p>But that's still three separate roles for one script to perform, and
they expose complexity in root-filesystem.sh that's been glossed over
so far.  So the question is, what user interface should all this have?</p>

<p>Once gain, easy to do, hard to make _clean_...</p>

<p>Ok, building the simple cross compiler is:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Build binutils, gcc, and ccwrap

FROM_ARCH= PROGRAM_PREFIX="${ARCH}-" build_section binutils
FROM_ARCH= PROGRAM_PREFIX="${ARCH}-" build_section gcc
FROM_ARCH= PROGRAM_PREFIX="${ARCH}-" build_section ccwrap

# Build C Library

build_section linux-headers
HOST_UTILS=1 build_section uClibc
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Building both the non-simple cross compiler and the native compiler are
just:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Build C Library

build_section linux-headers
build_section uClibc

# Build binutils, gcc, and ccwrap

build_section binutils
build_section gcc
build_section ccwrap
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The difference being how PROGRAM_PREFIX and FROM_ARCH are set.</p>

<p>So basically, if FROM_ARCH is blank, build the C library first,
otherwise build it afterwards, and leave the setting of those two
variables to the calling script?  Or should that information be on the
compiler.sh command line?  And then there's distinguishing the static cross
compiler for the host arch (prefixed) from a native compiler (unprefixed).</p>

<p>Hmmm...  Implementation's fairly straightforward, figuring
out a sane UI is still the hard part.)</p>

<p>I'm <a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/367463/>still arguing with the
internet</a>.  This is <a href=http://xkcd.com/386/>par for the
course</a>, I suppose.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Got my big ccwrap.c update checked in yesterday, and today I taught
the build_section logic to run package.build and package.sh (the first
does setup/cleanup for "package" automatically, and the second you do
your own setup and cleanup.  Basically decided to automate only the
easy cases, and let the others set themselves up manually.  (So any package
that uses a separate build directory sets itself up so I don't have to
figure out how to pass in the extra data, for example.)</p>

<p>During the upcoming disentanglement of the download/extract/setupfor
logic I might strip out the build directory logic from setupfor and just
have the script do that by hand.  (mkdir ../thingy isn't hard, and I
already have to list the build directory explicitly when doing cleanup,
so just having that be an rm -rf lets me remove that logic from the
cleanup function.)</p>

<p>The old "repetition vs clarity" debate rages on...</p>

<p>Why am I <a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/367250/>Arguing with The Bruce</a>
again?  Come on, I know better, I even
<a href=http://www.positivethinkers.net/products/battle-not-with-stupid-print>own one of these</a>.</p>

<p>Um, actuallly I think I gave my copy to Beth.  Right, I need to get a _new_
one of those and hang it somewhere prominent.  (Scan it in and use it as
desktop wallpaper, perhaps.  Or just use the

<p>I'm amused that Bruce and I can oppose the lawsuit for such completely
different reasons.  I'm also somewhat amused that Bruce has been flogging
his rant (which I still haven't read more than the first few sentences of)
more or less as a press release, of _vital_ importance for the community
at large to read, and it's gotten all sorts of coverage about how he was
never involved and still isn't involved and is all indignant about it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my blog entry explaining that while I used to be involved I've
stopped, and my reasoning for doing so (based on actual inside information),
is not on slashdot or LWN or such.  (I didn't expect it to be, but it's
probably more informative than anything Bruce has to say.)</p>

<p>Oh well.  Self-promotion is Bruce's thing.  Me, I write code instead.</p>

<p>There are times I want to <a href=http://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-devel-list/2007-March/msg00666.html>slap Ulrich Drepper</a>.</p>

<p>The fix he claims doesn't exist is to "#undef _FORTIFY_SOURCE" before
your #includes, because complaining that I'm
not checking the return value of asprintf() is just _stupid_.  (The malloc
only fails if you run out of _virtual_ memory, not out of physical memory.
Exhaustion of physical memory happens later when you dirty the pages, and
triggers the OOM killer which you can't do much about.  Yes, nommu can have
a harder time of it but that can fail allocating your program's _stack_.)</p>

<p>And no, the suggested fix of introducing an unnecessary typecast to (void)
on each occurrence no longer seems to work.  I'd guess they found out that
people were actually doing it, so they removed it.</p>

<p>(I had a macro wrapper that was going int unused=asprintf(), but then
it complained about an unused variable.  THERE IS NOTHING I WANT TO DO
WITH THIS VALUE.  GO AWAY.)</p>

<p>And you wonder why I want an alternative to glibc?  You do not know what's
best for me, and if you try to give me no choice you can't take away the
choice to use a different implementation than yours.  Idiots.</p>

<p>Some people are assuming I'm involved in the
<a href=http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/12/14/210207>most recent
round of BusyBox lawsuits</a>.  I'm not.  I
<a href=notes-2008.html#13-12-2008>lost faith in the SFLC's judgement</a>
about what is and isn't a good lawsuit to file back when they filed suit
against Cisco for a 5 year old toolchain that Cisco got from a vendor
(Broadcom) and which predated the original BusyBox vs Linksys lawsuit
circa 2003.</p>

<p>The result of that was that Cisco's big "Strategic investment in Linux"
ended.  Cisco had brought me in to consult on that, their plans to base
every single new product on Linux, and schedule a week of license auditing
and publication work between the time they got a golden master image and the
time it actually went to manufacturing.  It was an aggressive, "bet the company
on Linux" move, and the week the suit was filed it went from "our first project
using this new process will be the in-development
<a href=http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/promo/Media-Hub>MediaHub</a>"
to "our corporate use of Linux at all 'is under review'".  A few weeks later
I was told the CTO who had been behind the big Linux push was "spending
more time with his family" or some such (never did get the details).
And then a few months later, the entire Linksys division was reorganized out
of existence (at the end of August).  The brand name still exists, but the
engineers I knew have all left the company (rather than be reassigned to
work on non-Linux projects).</p>

<p>The remaining Linux support (for existing products that already shipped)
seems to have been outsourced to Red Hat.  Last I checked (a few months ago)
I couldn't find any Linux work Cisco was still doing in-house, and that
massive 180 seemed to have been in direct response to the "Mepis II: Even
Dumber" lawsuit the SFLC filed on behalf of the FSF.</p>

<p>The toolchain in question came from Broadcom back around 2002.  Cisco never
_had_ the source code to it, because Broadcom refused to give it to them.
The SFLC never made Broadcom a party to the suit, thus the company that
was cooperating with the Linux community was punished and the one that wasn't
was ignored.</p>

<p>The only reason that toolchain hadn't already been replaced was that after
the first lawsuit back in 2003, Cisco washed their hands of Linux for five years
and outsourced maintenance of existing projects to Taiwan, and switched their
new routers to VxWorks instead.  They had just gotten over that a few
months before this lawsuit was filed, and their new projects were using
toolchains built from source in-house (instead of supplied by an outside
vendor).</p>

<p>The toolchain in question contained no interesting IP, projects
like OpenWRT had been happily targeting that hardware with fully open source
toolchains for _years_.  From an engineering perspective, there was NO REASON
to file the lawsuit that got filed, unless you wanted to STOP Cisco from
cooperating with the Linux community and doing new Linux development.
Which seems to be what happened.  It was INCREDIBLY STUPID, and destructive,
and massively counterproductive, and it made the community look bad.</p>

<p>That's why I'm not involved in the current round of Busybox suits.  I have
zero faith that the SFLC understands which lawsuits are in the interests of
the community, and which are the equivalent of patent trolling.  Humoring
the more zealous and clueless excesses of the FSF's idealism division (the
parts that call Tim O'Reilley a "parasite" for producing good documentation for
sale, and say that having a day job writing proprietary code is "a sin")...
That's not helpful to Linux.  We have enough trouble distancing ourselves
from the lunatic fringe as it is.</p>

<p>Erik Andersen's still going along with it, although based on the rounds I
was involved in, I'd guess his involvement is limited to signing whatever
paperwork they send him and mailing it back.  Erik hasn't had any real
involvement with BusyBox since about 2006, he's busy with other things.
His last commit to the busybox repository was October 19, 2006.
He hasn't posted to the busybox mailing list at all this year, and in 2007
and 2008 combined he posted a total of 5 messages: one about the lawsuit,
twice under the title "New mailserver test -- ignore", and twice asking
people to delete files off the server when its disk filled up.  (I note
that OSUOSL reinstalled that server and took over its administration a
year ago, after it got cracked due to lack of maintenance.)</p>

<p>Last time I talked to the SFLC about this I suggested they get current
Busybox maintainer Denys Vlasenko involved.  They declined.  The current
Busybox project has no connection to these lawsuits that I am aware of,
and the SFLC seems to prefer it that way.</p>

<p>Oh, one other fun detail: the code drops we did get from the rounds of
suits I was involved with?  As far as I know, it
didn't result in a single line added to the BusyBox repository.  From an
engineering perspective, the entire exercise was _completely_useless_.</p>

<p>By the way, I got a blanket email monday sent out to all "Conservancy"

<p>Obviously I'm not speaking for the SFLC, or for BusyBox.  I haven't even
read the new press release, so I don't know who they sued this time, or over
what.  I think the last time I had any communication with them was about 6
months ago, but they kept switching who it was I was talking to, so searching
for the email would be more trouble than it's worth.</p>

<p>I dunno how "public" a blog entry is.  (My sick cat is doing much better,
thanks.)  But yeah: not involved this time, done enough damage already.
Driving companies away from Linux while giving the FSF's screwball division
a bigger soapbox is not what I signed up for, so I didn't re-enlist
for the current round.</p>

<p>Update: I have been pointed at <a href=http://perens.com/blog/2009/12/15/23/>this guy</a>
but haven't got the stomach to read it.  That man is <a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/202106/>the reason I stopped doing BusyBox development</a>.</p>

<p>As for why the SFLC chooses not to include him in the lawsuits, perhaps
the fact he was
<a href=http://busybox.net/~landley/forensics.txt>proven not to have any
code remaining in it years ago, let alone today</a> might have something
to do with it?</p>

<p>Bruce abandoned BusyBox two years before Erik Andersen picked up the
dead code and re-launched it, and then Bruce didn't bother to post or
subscribe to Erik's new list for most of a decade (until he suddenly
showed up not to contribute code but to be a license troll, at which time
Bruce's web page said that BusyBox was maintained by Lineo, a company that
Erik had left something like seven years earlier).</p>

<p>It wouldn't help the SFLC to involve Bruce because he has nothing
to do with BusyBox.  That's a significant reason BusyBox has been as
successful as it has: Bruce's _lack_ of involvement in it.</p>

<p>If any of the above comes off like I'm dissing Erik: I'm not.  Erik
Andersen is the reason BusyBox exists today.  He could just as easily have
grabbed Red Hat's Nash or started his own new codebase from scratch, that just
wasn't his style.  Erik wandered away from BusyBox development partly because
uClibc and BuildRoot were eating his time, and then because he had his
own company to run and a family to care for.  (Erik continued to administer
the server it ran on even after that, albeit somewhat distractedly.)</p>

<p>Erik found a new maintainer (me), just as I found a new maintainer (Denys)
to hand the project off to.  Bruce let his version die, and the current one
is at least as separate from his version as modern BSD is from the Bell Labs
code of 1975.  Whatever else may be going on, the SFLC is right to keep
itself away from Bruce.  If only they'd kept themselves seperate from the
rest of the extremist wing of the FSF...</p>

<p>Right.  Enough of that.  Coding...</p>

<p>Ha.  Changing /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh to this means the stupid hal/dbus
layer doesn't get a chance to veto the suspend:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

chvt 1
sync
echo mem > /sys/power/state
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I should probably swap that in for sleep.sh as well so the low battery
stuff doesn't go "yesterday, VLC was playing some media, and it didn't
notify HAL when it _stopped_, thus it seems to think it's playing three
media streams simultaneously when in fact VLC isn't curently running.  So
refuse to suspend, instead just let it run out of power and have
the hard drive do its emergency park."</p>

<p>And you wonder why the drive's got a bad sector on it...</p>

<p>I would like to find the developers responsible for this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
        char inFile[80]={0}, outFile[80]={0};
...
        sscanf(argv[2], "%s", inFile);
        sscanf(argv[3], "%s", outFile);
...
        // Read data and generate header
        fh = open(inFile, O_RDONLY);
        if ( fh == -1 ) {
                printf("Open input file error!\n");
                free( pHeader );
                exit(1);
        }
        lseek(fh, 0L, SEEK_SET);
        if ( read(fh, buf, status.st_size) != status.st_size) {
                printf("Read file error!\n");
                close(fh);
                free(pHeader);
                exit(1);
        }
        close(fh);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>And I would like to ask them what they were smoking.  The unnecessary
lseek, printing error messages to stdout instead of stderr, closing and
freeing data right before exiting the program...  Those are just
noise.  But going out of your way to _introduce_ a buffer overrun like that
is kind of impressively bad.  (It's from cvimg.c by some guy at realtek,
circa 2004.)</p>

<p>There are times you look at a program and just start over from scratch.
This may be one of those times.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>So the larger contract I'm working on right now is to come up with a decent
board support package for a router that's using "not mips" processors.
The relationship between Mips and the Lexra 5200 is a bit like m68k vs coldfire
or PowerPC vs ppc-440, except with more historical acrimony.</p>

<p>Once upon a time a company called Lexra made a mips clone, based on
the freely published MIPS instruction set.  Unfortunately, four of those
instructions had patents on them (unaligned loads and stores, because obviously
nobody have ever done _that_ before 1986).  So Lexra removed those instructions
from the chips they designed, coming up with entirely original circuitry
implementing a less efficient but patent-free subset of the original MIPS
instruction set.</p>

<p>Alas, Mips still sued them, arguing that when the chip encountered these
"illegal" instructions it threw an exception, and somebody could write an
exception handler in software that would then implement the original behavior
(even though the hardware didn't), and thus the chips violated the
patents _anyway_.</p>

<p>The lawsuit dragged on for years.  As far as I can piece together,
<a href=http://jonahprobell.com/lexra.html>Lexra made
progress convincing the PTO to invalidate the patent, but MIPS still tied Lexra
up in court until the smaller company ran out of money</a>, then MIPS
more or less bought them out with
<a href=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/MIPS_architecture_-_History/id/5265403>a large cash payment and a free MIPS license</a>
in exchange for
<a href=http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-equipment-computer/6196285-1.html>Lexra voluntarily going out of business</a>.</p>

<p>Really.  Here's a quote from that last link, the joint press release Mips
and Lexra put out about the settlement.  It is an impressive piece of
corporate-speak as you'll ever see:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lexra will shift from the intellectual property (IP) licensing business and
become a fabless semiconductor company while at the same time licensing the
MIPS32 architecture for use in its upcoming network infrastructure chip. Under
the terms of the license agreement, Lexra acknowledges the validity and
enforceability of MIPS Technologies patents. As Lexra is exiting the IP
licensing business, Lexra will assign its processor IP assets over to MIPS
Technologies and both companies will work together to convert Lexra's current
customers into MIPS Technologies' customers.</p>

<p>"We strongly support Lexra's new direction as a fabless semiconductor
company," said John Bourgoin, chairman and CEO of MIPS Technologies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Becoming a "fabless semiconductor company" while "exiting the IP
licensing business" means you don't make chips and you don't license
technology to anybody else who does make chips.  Your customers have
now been switched over to another company anyway, to which you assigned all your
existing chip design intellectual property, after declaring that gosh, those
patents we spent all that time fighting really _do_ cover using purely
theoretical software you never actually wrote to implement things the
hardware goes out of its way to avoid doing.</p>

<p>This is what the CEO of MIPS "strongly support"ed, with a straight face.
Is it any wonder the rest of the industry switched en masse over to ARM chips
instead?</p>

<p>But before all that happened, the Lexra 5200 processor design was licensed to
Realtek, which used it in a pair of System On Chip designs, the RTL 8181 and
the RTL 8186.  These were a Lexra 5200 processor plus integrated serial,
ethernet, wifi, PCI, and so on.  (The two chips used the same "subset of mips"
compiler, but different kernel .configs for the different peripheral device
versions integrated onto the chip.  Also, for some reason the /proc/cpuinfo
in the kernel identifies this sucker as a "Philips Nino".  Presumably another
licensee of the Lexra chip designs?)</p>

<p>After Mips put Lexra out of business, Realtek discontinued the 8186 rather
than be "converted" into a MIPS Technologies customer, but that didn't stop
Chinese companies from manufacturing their own RTL-8186 variants, which they
still do to this day.  They weren't the ones who got sued, and the patent in
question was filed in 1986 and presumably expired circa 2006 anyway.  These
chips are small, low power, and really, really cheap.</p>

<p>However, because of the FUD cloud surrounding the chip design, the
patches to support this stuff in Linux never made it upstream.  All the
toolchain tweaks do is remove the four unimplemented instructions, so those
changes are trivial to forward-port, but they never got cleaned up so they're
a proper ./configure target instead of a hardwired #if 0-ing out of chunks of
the source code.  So the compilers available targeting this hardware are
of the 3.3.3 vintage.</p>

<p>Worse, the integrated peripherals on the SoC are all hand-rolled Realtek
stuff, the drivers for which never went upstream either.  Thus the kernels
that use them are circa 2.4.18.</p>

<p>I can't do much about the kernel right now (realtek only released binary
only drivers for its SoC peripherals, although there seem to be some open
source rewrites floating around out there on rtl8186.sourceforge.net
and such).  But the toolchain and user space I can clean up and upgrade.</p>

<p>Hah.  <a href=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-landley/8/539/675>My
father's on Linkedin</a>.  I should probably figure out how to send an
invite, but I don't actually use linkedin.  (Just respond when people
poke me about it.)</p>

<p>Sigh.  I need to sit down and spend the hour to write up a C version of
the first perl removal patch (the hard part being surgery on the Makefile,
not the actual C code).  I just feel totally uninspired.</p>

<p>Misplaced my credit/debit card a day or two back.  Phoned up to cancel it.
Found the now-cancelled card five minutes later, in a bundle of papers on
top of the fridge.  (I refer to this as the "credit card summoning ritual",
and find it quite reliable.)  Thus I am on a cash economy this week,
spending only what I can carry with me.  Probably good discipline, but it
means I'm worrying about money, which is a source of stress I'm not good at
coping with.</p>

<p>Backing up my laptop to the terabyte drive, it encountered a bad sector.
At first I thought it was in the external drive, but no, it's in my _laptop_.
It's just the one, and it encountered the same bad sector in two different
files (indicating the suckers are probably crosslinked), and it's in big media
files I was copying from Mark so I hadn't noticed (because I'm not up to
Mythbusters season 4 or Penn and Teller season 6 yet).</p>

<p>It's possible that the bad sector is because the power got cut
during a write (which might also explain the crosslinking if reading a bad
sector confused ext3's journal replay or something).  This might have happened
if I forgot to plug the sucker in while leaving it copying, and VLC vetoed the
suspend when the battery ran out (because hey, yesterday it was playing some
media at it _remembers_, man -- it does this all the time and I have yet to
figure out how to shoot HAL/DBUS in the face with a bazooka for being _stupid_
yet).</p>

<p>Darn it, I actually don't know.  It sounds like I'm tring to talk myself
out of reconizing a problem as serious.  If I was fully employed I'd just buy
new hardware and not worry about it.  This laptop is 3 years old anyway, the
new laptop smell has definitely worn off.  (So have the letters on the n, m, c,
and d keys, and the &gt; sign.)</p>

<p>But in the past few months, I've had a cat with skin cancer, another cat with
(treatable) liver failure, my car's brakes replaced, my sister going through a
divorce, two people buying health insurance more or less as individuals (which
costs more than the mortage, condo association fee, and electricity combined),
and of course trying to put Fade through college (which is important and should
not be interrupted by financial concerns).  Coming up, annual property taxes
on the condo, the upstairs carpet needs to be replaced (cats again), trip to
visit Fade's relatives, have Ike's or Lamb's frown professionally at the new
clunking noise my car's making (hoping it's a CV joint and not the
transmission)...</p>

<p>Intermittent contract work keeps the lights on, but in a recession it is
_not_ comfortable.  Once upon a time I could always let my apartment lease
expire, put my stuff in storage, and go visit relatives or friends for
a few months to get away from it all.  Money just wasn't that important
because I barely spent any.  But I haven't got that option anymore, now
I have a mortgage and a wife and cats, and the bills keep coming.  There
are expenses I have to _keep_up_ with.  It's disconcerting.  (Adulthood
sort of sneaks up on you, doesn't it?)</p>

<p>It turns out what I'm really not good at coping with is the _annoyance_ of
small expenses.  I drove off without my gas cap, I'm not even sure where
to buy another one of those (Fry's?).  The light bulb in the fridge burned
out, I need to find a place that sells _those_ (and probably replace it myself
instead of just hiring a guy to Make Problem Go Away).  My laptop battery now
lasts half an hour on a full charge, is replacing that a luxury or a necessity?
My sound cancelling headphones are held together with duct tape.  It's time to
renew the little car tax sticker that says Nelda has gotten her tithe.</p>

<p>These are incidentals.  I've spent more at restaurants than any of them
costs.  I'm not used to them adding up and becoming stress.
I'm used to having a financial cushion between me and them, but it's worn a
bit thin of late.  I currently have the money to pay for these incidentals,
but I'm reluctant to do so because I can't _stop_ another cat from becoming
sick, or the noise the car's making from being serious, or my laptop dying,
or my glasses breaking, or sudden unexpected dental work, or The
Unexpected in general.</p>

<p>This is why I was willing to move to Pittsburgh for a job back in 2006.
I could earn twice per hour what they were paying me, but they _kept_ doing
it so I didn't have to worry about where next month's work would come from.
Alas, by the time I was on my third CEO, dozenth co-worker farewell luncheon,
and fourth boss (who _I_ had to train), I had to admit that "stability" was
not really what that job was providing.  (Turns out it's hard to combine
"stability" with "interesting work", or maybe I'm just not good at finding
it.)</p>

<p>These days I'm hoping to move to Dublin for another shot at such
interesting stability.  I'm still waiting to see if I'll get the opportunity
to do so.  (I believe I'm entering week 7 of the decision process.  The search
for stability leads to prolonged uncertainty.  Adulthood is overrated.)</p>

<p>Oh well.  In the meantime, I have two other contracts to work on, and
expense reimbursement paperwork to fill out.  Reupholstering the financial
cushion would be nice.  I'm just not convinced it'll hold up to the next cat
attack.</p>

<p>Yesterday's bisectathon went off into one of those "git bisect skip

declare that particular build break "good" so I could track down the

<p>Which needed to be applied to bisect through a range of a thousand

apply to that range, and thus I could bisect through it.</p>


<p>That meant that the bisectathon wound up with this, on about the third
attempt:</p>

<pre>
There are only 'skip'ped commit left to test.
The first bad commit could be any of:
0e0fe9219d2e5426d87a0f62db445010d4aba2c7

We cannot bisect more!
</pre>

<p>So the first 9 of those 11 commits are a range of patches by
Catalin Marinas committed on July 24.  The other two are branch
merges by Russell King (the arm maintainer), so shouldn't be
introducing any new code.</p>

<p>Which means that the commit that introduced this bug should be one
of Catalin's commits.  According to the order "git log" shows commits
in, those first nine are a contiguous block (of _course_ not in the order
git bisect just dumped 'em in though, that would be too easy).  The last
commit before any of those was 05efde9d04ccc, which worked.  The next
one isn't by Catalin but by Hyok Choi of samsung, and it's introducing
a new config symbol.  There you go.</p>

<p>I'm not at all surprised by this.  I actually suspected something like it,
but it shouldn't be that much of a pain to bisect to find a simple tweak
you need to make.</p>

<p>Ok, I need a config upgrade script.  I need to expand a miniconfig
against "stable", copy that .config to the alt- tree, do an oldconfig,
and then compress it back down to a miniconfig...  Hmmm, what UI should
an automated script to do that have...  Ok, that might work.</p>

<p>And lo, FWL 0.9.9 has shipped.  (Using linux 2.6.31.6 rather than 2.6.32
because .32 still needs fixing.)</p>

<p>I spent bits of the weekend and the first part of this week tracking
down what to do about the PowerPC pmac_zilog serial panic, and now I've
checked in a one line fix.  (It's a test for null, averting the null pointer
dereference.  Doesn't seem to hurt anything else.)  Probably not the right
fix (since it's in common code and not pmac_zilog.c), but I posted said one
liner to the linuxppc-dev list for them to _properly_ fix it upstream, and
it's small enough for me to deal with it myself in the meantime.  Not
_currently_ my problem.  (I also posted the updated perl removal patches to
linux-kernel, fairly _early_ in the merge window this time.  Here's hoping.)</p>

<p>So why is git's user interface so horrible?  Here's an example:</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to bisect why the arm targets no longer produce any serial
console output in 2.6.32.  The kind of random breakage you get each new
release, only now in arm rather than ppc.</p>

<p>I start bisecting betwee 2.6.31 (good) and 2.6.32 (bad).  I set up my
build environment to yank all the patches I'm applying, and symlink perl from
the build/host directory just so I don't have to deal with what applies
to what.  (I'm only running system-image.sh anyway, not trying to cross
compile the root filesystem.  No ./configures involved.)</p>

<p>The previous bisect hiccuped on some random file conflict, so I did a
checkout -f and then restarted it.  (git bisect reset, git bisect good,
git bisect bad.)  The first one is a git bisect skip, and the second is
git bisect bad.  And then it does this:</p>

<blockquote>
Bisecting: 3098 revisions left to test after this
error: Untracked working tree file 'arch/arm/mach-w90x900/mach-w90p910evb.c' would be overwritten by merge.
</blockquote>

<p>I <a href=/writing/git-quick.html>happen to know</a> you can fix that with
"git clean -fdx", which I probably should have done last time (although nothing
anywhere _hints_ that you're supposed to do this, they just expect you to
memorize the magic incantation).  But here's my question: what state is the
thing in now?  Do I need to do "git bisect bad" again?  Will another checkout
-f put me before or after the bisect bad?  It gives me no hints what to do
next.  It just expects me to _know_.</p>

<p>I do happen to know to do a "git bisect log", and I get this:</p>

<p>At 4:30 security started letting people back into the area with the
nice google beanbags and the promise of a foot court opening at 5 am
where I could get a beverage.  Unfortunately, yesterday's boarding pass
no longer worked, so the security people directed me to the Alaska
desk where they assured me someone would be there.</p>

<p>And there was someone, at every other airline's booth.  But the Alaska
people didn't show up until an hour after everyone else (including again
the Frontier booth next door).  In the meantime, their computer insisted
I wasn't booked on that flight, and would not issue a boarding pass.
So I spent an hour standing there in front of the only unstaffed desk,
holding an orange "security" pass that would let me skip about 3 minutes of
screening line.  Whee.</p>

<p>Apparently the boarding pass they gave me yesterday was a specially
coded sort of scarlet letter, telling every Alaska employee who saw it
that I was to be treated like a transgressor.  The new one looked completely
different, today went much better, and the planes they exist to fly around
are relatively pleasant once you're on them.</p>

<p>For a second time my safety information card was stuck together by
something spilled into its little plastic pocket.  This time it wasn't still
damp with chunks stuck to it, nor was there wasn't a puddle of it on the floor
in the space I was expected to put my backpack into, which was an
improvement over the flight out.  (Instead it tore in half when I tried to
open it.)  Didn't care.  Slept on the plane, and got something to drink when
I woke up.  Bliss.</p>

<p>Not flying that airline again voluntarily, though.  Ever.</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>Stuck in an airport theatre presents: my day as described in the email
I sent to the person in charge of Alaska Airlines' twitter account:</p>

<p>I normally fly SouthWest, and admit I have been spoiled by them.</p>

<p>Southwest sees its mission
as getting people to their destinations.  If they have to cram you into
an overhead bin to get you there, they will.  (Southwest is proof positive
you can get the contents of a Greyhound bus airborne.)  But by
<a href=http://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/6362692608>Pharamond</a>
they will GET you there, generally on time.  It's what they do.  It's what
Southwest is _for_.  (I once had a southwest employee take me in their
_own_car_ to another nearby airport when a flight was overbooked.)</p>

<p>In contrast, legacy carriers see their
business as flying planes around from place to place.  Whether or not you're
_on_ them isn't really their problem, they have more important things to
worry about.  They take your money, which pays to fly the plane, and
everything else is unimportant.  I had forgotten this.</p>

<p>Human resources people tend not to book on southwest.  It's apparently
some side effect of the fact that they're not set up to give discounts
to travel agents.  The price on southwest's website is the cheapest price
they offer to anybody.  (They might as well just offer it directly to
customers.)  So it wasn't too surprising when a resources person in Europe
booked me on Alaska Air between Austin and San Jose, and I managed to get here
ok.  (Although it was the first time I've deplaned onto the tarmac in
years.  Reminded me of Kwajalein.)  My flight back was a red eye this
morning.  I even went to bed early.</p>

<p>The problems started when the phone in my hotel room did not ring for the
wake up call I'd requested.  Instead my phone alarm woke me up, but it was
still set at the time I had to get up at _yesterday_.  AAAHHH!!!</p>

<p>Still, it was 8am and the plane took off at 8:55 and the airport's 20
minutes  away.  I wasn't checking any bags, wasn't returning a rental car,
and I'd made tighter time crunches before.  (On Southwest.)</p>

<p>I tried to call the lobby to get them to pre-order me a taxi: the phone
can't call the lobby.  It is completely dead.  Great.</p>

<p>Reluctantly skip the shower, shove everything in my backpack, head downstairs 
(elevator, cannot make it go faster), had the front desk call a taxi for 
immediate pickup (and informed them about the broken phone, which they 
confirmed wasn't working before the taxi arrived).  The nice taxi guy only 
took about 5 minutes to get there and then did 80 getting me to the airport.  
So I arrived at 8:30, meaning I still had 25 minutes left to make the flight.</p>

<p>The last time I had a similar problem was about five years ago, back when the 
post-911 security theatre frenzy was even worse.  I arrived at the airport 
with 12 minutes before my flight took off, and Southwest got me on the plane 
with almost a full minute to spare.  Admittedly that was _awesome_ of them
(and started my loyal-customer-ness), but this time I had over twice that much
time.  It was tight, but I might still make it!</p>

<p>Run to the alaska check-in machines... which wouldn't let me check in for the 
flight.  Doesn't acknowledge that flight number exists.  What?  Ok, run to the 
Alaska counter, stand in line to speak to the bureaucrat at the desk, and the 
lady there _spent_time_arguing_with_me_ that it was too late to get on the 
plane.  But she eventually agreed to let me try since the plane had not,
in fact, taken off yet.  (My argument was something like "The plane is
right over there, it hasn't left yet, can I try to get on it please?  I
just need a boarding pass.")</p>

<p>Run to the security theatre line, spent a dozen or so minutes getting through 
that.  (Yes of course my bag was pulled out for manual screening.  I was in a 
hurry.  Same bag that I took to SJC, containing the same stuff that didn't 
get screened on the way here, but oh well.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I got out of security theatre.  RUN to the gate.  There were still
6 minutes left (according to the clock at the gate) until the scheduled
take-off time of the flight.  Victory!  And... the desk has nobody at it?  Over 
to the next gate's desk...  Where is the plane?  They tell me the plane is 
"already in the air".</p>

<p>At this point, I refrained from asking the bureaucrat at this new desk what 
the time listed on my reservation actually represents.  (That's when it 
achieves cruising altitude?  If I was taking a bus, train, or SouthWest,
making it physically to the vehicle boarding point six minutes before the
scheduled departure time would work.  But apparently, not in this context.)</p>

<p>Raising that sort of issue is not helpful.  I know never to debate policy
with the worker bees in a bureaucracy.</p>

<p>So instead I asked her the standard bureaucracy navigation question: "What
should I do now?"  And here is the most important difference between Alaska
and Southwest: she did not, in fact, care.  The plane was in good hands,
I could go hang.</p>

<p>She books me on tomorrow's version of the same flight, hands me the pass,
and turns away from a job well done.  I ask her "So I should wait here in the
airport for 24 hours?", and she replied (and I quote), "I guess so", and
turned away again.  (Note: there was nobody in line behind me, she was turning
to face the other person at the desk.)</p>

<p>I'm aware at this point that the lady wants me to go away, presumably
because she thinks I've committed some kind of sin arriving at the gate
only 6 minutes before the time listed on my flight information printout.
She clearly feels that she is the wronged party, and keeps turning away
from me at the slightest  opportunity.  (Ok, I know I had to skip my
shower-and-shave this morning, and I probably have hilarious gravity-defying
bed hair, but would a little eye contact kill you?)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I persist for a few follow-up questions, which clearly annoy 
her:</p>

<p>1) Was there a later flight?  No, there are no later flights, Alaska
Airlines only has one flight to Austin per day.</p>

<p>2) Do they fly to San Antonio?  Oh no, of course not.  (She seemed to think
I was crazy for asking.)</p>

<p>3) Anywhere else in Texas at all, from where I could get a bus...?  Not
today.</p>

<p>At this point the lady makes her first non-prompted suggestion: I could buy
a ticket on another airline, with my own money.  She makes sure to clarify this 
last part of her suggestion, which again is the first actual suggestion she's 
made about what I can do next.</p>

<p>I take the hint.  I wander to a corner of the waiting area near an outlet,
find a chair, and plug in my laptop.  In a few minutes the sign changes to a
Sacramento flight.  After the Sacramento flight boards and departs, there's a
shift change and a new lady at the desk.  I have a number of questions the
previous lady obviously wasn't interested in answering, and I try one on the
new person:</p>

<p>Can I get a transfer through another airport, three or four hops even?  She 
checks her computer: It's not even 10am yet and Alaska Air does not have 
any flights, from anywhere in the country, going to anywhere in Texas, until 
tomorrow.  (Apparently travel on this airline offers no fallback plans
whatsoever.  Good to know.)</p>

<p>I go back and sit in my corner, but this lady (on her own initiative) starts 
working on my case.  After about 15 minutes on the phone she rebooks me on 
another airline.  (Yay!)  She gives me a little printout thing on a boarding 
pass, which I gladly accept, thank her _profusely_, and follow her directions 
back out through security and to the Frontier Airlines desk next to the Alaska 
desk.  At this point, despite how the morning has gone, I am _happy_.  It is 
FIXED!  I get to go HOME!</p>

<p>The woman at frontier airlines doesn't know what to do with the Alaska stub.  
That's fine, I've got an hour and a half until the flight, there is plenty of 
time.  She suggests they might be able to accept my ticket at face value and 
let me pay the difference?  Sure, I just want to get home, thank you.  She 
takes the it to the Alaska desk next door where she and two other people 
huddle over the computer.</p>

<p>At this point, a fourth person comes to the Alaska counter.  It's the lady who 
wasted time arguing with me this morning while I was rushing to catch my 
flight.  From over at the frontier desk, over the noise of the people in line, 
I hear her yell "No, he was late!  He agreed to go on tomorrow's flight!  We're 
not doing that!".  Since this is news to me (not having had caffeine yet my 
contributions to our earlier interaction had been things like "Please, can you 
just let me go to the gate?  I've still got X minutes", while looking at my
watch still in Texas time).</p>

<p>I go over to the Alaska counter, where the lady from this morning is busily
un-fixing my issue.  Apparently she had unilaterally attached conditions
to allowing me to attempt to get to my flight before it took off, and was
angry for me altering a bargain I had not, in point of fact, noticed.  (When
wastes-time-with-arguments showed up, the Frontier lady went right back to her
desk to serve the next people in line.  I envy her escape.)  So the lady from
this morning returns things to her idea of the status quo (decided the moment
she saw me, apparently) while trying to start a fresh argument about it
(or perhaps continue the one from this morning).</p>

<p>At this point, I have meaningfully interacted with three Alaska Air
employees.  Two of them treated me like a species of bug that had done
something nasty on the carpet, and the third (who actually tried to _help_)
seems to have been cut off at the knees for having done so (I assume it's her
being yelled at through the phone).  Not wanting to get the only nice one in
further trouble, I don't argue with the one in front of me as she switches
my ticket back to what she feels is right and proper.  Since she's already
under the impression I must have agreed with her earlier, I now _do_ agree
it must all be my mistake, and ask her the "So what do I do now" question,
which is ignored.</p>

<p>I ask about a hotel.  This gets a better response.  She's obviously happy
at the idea of me accepting my place, taking my punishment of waiting until
tomorrow, and most importantly going away and not bothering her anymore.
And thus she deigns to answer this one.  She says
that I can go to the rental car area and call a hotel from there, some of
them have "distressed flyer" discount rates.  She does not name a specific
chain, despite repeated attempts at clarification.</p>

<p>At this point I decide that volunteering information is against company
policy.  She points me towards the baggage claim area.  Our conversation was
over.</p>

<p>I wasn't really interested in leaving for a hotel and potentially having
this problem all over again tomorrow morning.  I am at the airport.
Leaving the airport is not progress.  (Besides, my ability to get lost is
_epic_, wandering around a city I don't know is not my idea of fun.)</p>

<p>I'm tired.  I just want to go home.</p>

<p>I go back to wastes-time-with-arguments and ask her how I get to the
SouthWest terminal.  This elicits the first smile I've seen from an
Alaska Airlines employee so far.  Also the first truly helpful response.
Dunno if she's happy at the idea of me paying twice for the same trip,
or if it's merely the idea of losing me as a customer to another airline.</p>

<p>So I went over to Southwest to reassure myself that competent airlines
do still exist.  They were nice, they _cared_ (or faked it darn well),
they listened to my sad story, and they had three more flights that day
to Austin, but the best they could do was offer me a last minute ticket
for about the same price Alaska costs with 2 weeks advance purchase.
(No this wasn't a special deal, this was the price on southwest.com.)
Called Fade and fiddled with my frequent flyer program to try to overcome
the fact I'm 5 credits short of a free flight.</p>

<p>Alas, I really couldn't convince myself that my comfort was worth
more than a new subnotebook, especially since I've got my laptop with me,
free wireless, electrical outlets galore, half a tin of penguin mints,
a food court (alas, at airport prices), and a flight I'm not paying for
tomorrow morning.  Refreshing as it was to hang around people who actually
_wanted_ me to reach my destination, my journey had not been entrusted to
their care this time around.  (To both sides' clear regret.)</p>

<p>I eventually bit the bullet, went back, and sat at gate C10.  Didn't interact
with another Alaska Airlines employee for several hours, until the nice
british lady working the gate for the incoming austin flight (around 5pm local
time) struck up a conversation with me.  (She's very nice,
warning me that this area would close overnight around 11pm, and talking a bit 
about the weather.  She's actually helping another customer too now, and being 
_helpful_.  So the nice/nasty record is 2 and 2.  Makes me feel better about 
the company in general, but I'm still sitting in Terminal C with no better 
option than to wait until morning.)  And around 7pm there was a nice security
guard, who let me stay in the semi-shuttered security area
(the motion sensors kept first turned the lights off in the Alaska Airlines
area around noon), until 11p when they were "closing the gates" and I finally
had to go out to the lobby.</p>
</span>

<p>Return trips have not been working out for me this weekend.  I hope
that returning home from the airport in Austin turns out ok.  (Hey,
I have a +6 familiarity modifier to navigation roles made in Austin,
_and_ the 100 flyer shuttle to UT from which I was planning to walk home
anyway, living on west campus and all.  Note to self: do not get hit by
car or anything during this.  Make sure bus does not explode.)</p>

<p>The Googleplex!</p>

<p>Wow that's a nice campus.  With fun people in it.</p>

<p>(I note that getting lost and winding up walking a couple miles back to my
hotel afterwards was entirely my fault.  Well nobody told me the "hotel
shuttle to local businesses" could get me there in the morning, but stops
early on fridays.  Still don't know where the bus stop I was looking for is,
but I needed the exercise anyway, and didn't exactly have plans for the
evening.  Hotel.  Bed early, red-eye home in the morning.)</p>

<a name="03-12-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#03-12-2009">December 3, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Hanging out at the rental car place in San Jose waiting for Solar and
Calculus (from freenode) to pick me up for dinner.  (The hotel
turns out to have a shuttle to businesses within 10 miles, so I don't need to
rent a car, assuming I can get back to the airport on saturday.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>So Firmware Linux is currently creating two cross compilers.  The first
is a quick and dirty simple one called "cross-compiler" which has no thread
support, incomplete c++ support, and is dynamically linked against the host's
C library.  But it's enough to build the root-filesystem, and to do distcc
acceleration (for both C and C++).</p>

<p>The second cross compiler is called "cross-static".  It has thread
support, uClibc++, and it's statically linked against uClibc for
portability.  It's (optionally) produced as a convenience for those crazy
people who want to cross compile extensive amounts of stuff.</p>

<p>There's little point in packaging up the simple cross compiler
for the downloads/binaries directory.  If you're downloading prebuilt
binaries, the second one is more capable, more portable, and generally
superior in all respects.  It's also a lot more complicated to build, among
other things requiring _TWO_ of the simple cross compilers to build
with (one for the host, one for the target) using a modified canadian cross
process to build uClibc binaries on a non-uClibc host.  (The native compiler
builds the same way, it just uses the same simple target compiler for both
its "host" and "target".)</p>

<p>Thus the quick and dirty one isn't going away, since creating that is
a necessary first step before creating the second more polished version.
But the "cross-compiler" I pack up isn't the one created by
"cross-compiler.sh".  That creates the _simple_ cross compiler.
The full-featured one is actually created by root-filesystem.sh with
some evil build flags.  Part of the Great Refactoring should allow me to
untangle and rename this, but to what?  Building a system image currently
requires calling cross-compiler.sh, root-filesystem.sh, and
system-image.sh, and that's a clear story.  The more complicated cross
compiler is a side branch.</p>

<p>Also, I'm building the native compiler twice, once as part of
root-filesystem.sh and once standalone.  I should clean that up.
Maybe the new toolchain builder script should be in sources/more?
Except build.sh isn't currently calling anything out of sources/more...</p>

<p>Argh.  Dismantling code that works because it's a MESS.  Always fun.
And figuring out the technical infrastructure is easy, figuring out
what to call it so other people can intuitively understand it without
needing a lot of documentation they'll never read is the hard part.</p>

<p>So I missed the deadline to get a release out at the end of november.
At this point I'm aiming for monday, I gotta catch a plane tomorrow.</p>

<p>The ongoing Great Refactoring horked the static toolchain, but I figured
out what I screwed up (moving the headers to the install location before
building libsupc++.a means the build can't find those headers).  I'm not
quite sure why the native toolchain builds and the static toolchain
doesn't.  Investigation proceeds, to the point where I've got several
different changes backed up and needing to be untangled so I can check them
in individually.  Such is life...</p>

<p>Digging through some old files I found recordings of an old Linucon
panel I never got to attend, called "This Topic Intentionally Left Blank"
(<a href=linucon/TopicLeftBlank1.MP3>part 1</a>,
<a href=linucon/TopicLeftBlank2.MP3>part 2</a>).  This was Steve Jackson,
Eric Raymond, and Howard Taylor put in a room for an hour to talk about

<a name="30-11-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#30-11-2009">November 30, 2009</a></h2>

<p>I've been reading a few articles about Google's job interview process,
first <a href=http://www.catonmat.net/blog/my-job-interview-at-google/>this
one</a> and more recently
<a href=http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html>this
one</a>.  The second of those reminded me of an old discussion
I had with Eric back when we were working on The Art of Unix Programming.</p>

<p>Some programmers are mathematicians at heart, and others are engineers at
heart.  Eric is a mathematician (as is the guy who wrote the second of
the above articles).  I'm an engineer.</p>

<p>Deep down, the mathematicians seem to believe in perfect abstract
algorithms, that flaws in programs are deviations from that platonic ideal,
and problems are either properly solved or not really solved.  The engineers
think that programs are data that controls the operation of circuitry, that
the algorithm is at best an approximation of what the machine's actually
_doing_ (many other aspects of which might wind up being important), and that
it's usually possible to improve on an existing solution.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it is that mathematicians are looking for truth, and
engineers are looking for consistent behavior they can improve upon.
Heuristics generally creep mathematicians out because they're not even
_trying_ to achieve perfection, but they're just another tool in the engineer's
toolbox which produce expected and controllable errors.</p>

<p>Good programmers of either flavor can see the other side's point of view,
but it's not where their instincts lie.</p>

<p>That's why when I read "most things are graph theory if you look hard
enough" in the above article, I thought "if all you have is a hamer,
everything looks like a nail".  That doesn't mean it isn't true, but I try to
be agnostic about the solution before I understand the problem.  Most problems
can be solved in a half-dozen ways, all of which suck differently, and you
min/max your way through it and either do the best you can by deadline or
change direction when you get a better understanding of the _actual_ problem
halfway through solving what you _thought_ the problem was.  "I can solve
this problem with graph theory" and "I can solve this problem with regexes"
are both probably true.</p>

<span id=politics>
<p>I don't understand why anyone ever votes Republican.  I don't get it.</p>

<p>Herbert Hoover was a Republican.  He's the guy who put the "Great" in The
Great Depression, and thus had
<a href=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1642.html>Hoovervilles</a> named
after him.  Joe McCarthy was a Republican.  He led the most overwrought
witch-hunts since Salem, and publicly equated being a Democrat with treason
(<a href=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/murrowmccarthy.html>yes really</a>).
Richard Nixon was a Republican.  The whole
<a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/chronology.htm>Watergate scandal</a>
was about Nixon's cronies getting caught breaking into the offices of the
Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p>How could anybody vote for these people?  How could any political party
survive that legacy?  The guy who <a href=http://bradhicks.livejournal.com/422902.html>undid Hoover's Damage</a> was a Democrat.  Bill Clinton balanced the
budget and paid down some of the debt between the first and second Bushes'
historic deficits.  Kennedy simultaneously faced down the Russians in Cuba
and launched the space program that got us to the moon _while_ paying down
huge amounts of our leftover debt from World war II.</p>

<p>The guy the Republicans hold up as their current idol, Ronald Regan,
suffered from Altzheimer's while in office.  He pursued communists with
the same blind zeal Joe McCarthy had, and got himself
hip deep in <a href=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande08.html>scandal</a> because of it, and his _defense_ was Altzheimer's.
Not that he hadn't done stuff, but that he didn't _remember_.
What kind of stuff?  Funding terrorist organizations to attack anybody we
didn't like in south america or the middle east, the same nutballs terrorists
that we're fighting today are the ones WE trained.  (Yes, that includes the
Taliban, and Saddam Hussein.)  Oh, and pursuing Regan's agenda racked up
trillions of debt, for the
<a href=http://zfacts.com/p/318.html>first time since World War II</a>
(including looting the Social Security trust fund),
essentially inventing our current budget problems (which two
Bushes exacerbated without even the excuse of facing down the Soviets,
but it _started_ with the massive fiscal irresponsibility
of the Regan administration).  That's their hero.</p>

<p>Who else is left?  Harry Truman (Democrat, FDR's vice president) used the
atomic bomb to end World War II and the Marshall Plan to clean up after it,
helped set up the United Nations and Nato to make sure it wouldn't happen
_again_.  His first executive order desegregated the military, his second
made it illegal to discriminate in civil service hiring based on race.
Truman was so successful that Republicans invoke his record all the time
in their campaign speeches!  Both <a href=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20108648,00.html>the first</a> and <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/31/AR2006053102039.html>the second</a>
Bush repeatedly invoked Harry Truman in their speeches,
despite voting against him, having Trumans' relatives ask them to stop,
and so on.  Truman himself equated "Republican" with "rapscallion" (his
word, if Wikipedia is to be believed).</p>

<p>Eisenhower was a Republican, elected because he was a World War II general,
and like Grant before him his administration was full
of corruption (Nixon was his Vice President, and McCarthy rose to power on his
watch unopposed).  But the guy himself was more defined by his military career
than his political party, and also had his hands full cleaning up after
World War II.</p>

<p>And of course Carter shows the main failure mode of the democrats: their
ability to be massively ineffective despite the best of intentions.  (The
current group has the presidency, large majorities in the house and the senate,
and they still can't get anything done.  Of course when the positions were
reversed, they couldn't prevent the other side from passing their entire
agendas virtually unopposed.)</p>

<p>I've said for years, the democrats are incompetent and the republicans
are evil.  But one side means well, and the other is doing things I'd
go to great lengths to _prevent_.  I can see wanting to replace most
Democrats with somebody with a spine, but what I don't understand is why
anybody would vote _for_ a Republican.</p>

<p>Sigh.  Remind me to make an rss feed generator that takes the span tags

<p>Yay, Andre Ruiz got back to me with a contract to work on a board
support package, somewhere between 50 and 100 hours of work total.
Assuming the details work out, that nicely fills up december.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Working on granularity in FWL.  Breaking up the various sources/sections
scripts so each one handles exactly one package, and moving more package
builds into sources/sections.</p>

<p>I introduced sources/sections to factor out common code, and if some
package builds live there they might as well all live there (so they're
all in one place).  Again, the age-old tension between being explicit and
not repeating yourself...</p>

<p>While I'm at it, time to audit sources/functions and see if some of those
functions are specific to FWL (read_arch_dir) and some are more generic
(download).  Possibly split that file into two files?  Have to work out
what's best.  I've already got some out-of-tree users of this code, and
just discussed some more use cases.  Trying to make it easy, the question
is how?</p>

<p>So far the best I've come up with for beating the path to the standard
headers out of gcc is:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
echo '#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;' | gcc -E - | sed -n 's@.*"\(.*\)/stdio\.h".*@\1@p;T;q'
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Poking at the sources/sections refactoring.  Lots of today was spent
frowning at why a gcc ./configure section was insisting on using
/lib/cpp instead of "i686-cc -E", until I figured out it wanted to use
"i686-c++ -E" (Um, ok?) and that I'd broken the C++ link names.  (Horrible
error reporting in this stuff.  Horrible.)</p>

<p>Today's "OS/2 could do that in 1994, why can't XFCE?" is that I can't
change the font size a terminal window.  I can change it for _all_ terminal
windows, but I can't go "this terminal window is monitoring a build process,
shrink it to 6 point font size and stick it in the corner set to always on
top".  (Of course you can do this with kde, etc.  But not with xfce.)</p>
</span>

<p>Picking away at the sources/sections refactoring.  I've mostly gotten
binutils/gcc/ccwrap broken up into individual scripts, although making
them reasonably orthogonal is a challenge.  For one thing, gcc is always
going to depend on binutils.  For another ccwrap expects a very particular
layout of the binutils and gcc output, and the logical thing to do is have
the first two scripts install things where ccwrap expects them, rather than
having ccwrap move them from one place to another.  (Because otherwise
ccwrap would just expect them in that _other_ place, which is silly.)</p>

<p>After I get that working again, the next step is to make ccwrap take an
existing functional toolchain and wrap it.  This is different from wrapping the
output of a fresh unpatched binutils/gcc build, because that toolchain
doesn't _work_.  If I ask this gcc "where is your compiler include directory",
it can't actually _find_ it.  A functional toolchain could respond to
"gcc --print-file-name=include" with a path.  Adding the wrapper is what makes
the FWL toolchain functional.</p>

<p>But if I have an existing functional toolchain, then I should be able to
beat the six paths out of it.  For compiler libraries, print-file-name of
"crtbegin.o" and "crt1.o" and grab all the ".o" files out of thoe
directories.  Do the same for "libgcc.a", "libgcc_eh.a", and "libgcc_s.so"
and grab all the .a and .so files.  Then "libc.a" and "libc.so" into the
non-cc lib directory.</p>

<p>I can also do "gcc --print-search-dirs", which gives "install", "programs",
and "libraries" directories (remember to chop off the pointless prepended
= sign from paths that start with that).  This might be useful to find
the linker and such to populate the "tools" directory.</p>

<p>But how do I find the system headers?  It's not in --print-search-dirs,
the --print-file-name won't find stdio.h...</p>

echo '#include <stdio.h>' | gcc -E - | sed -n 's@.*"\(.*\)/stdio\.h".*@\1@p;T;q'

<a name="25-11-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#25-11-2009">November 25, 2009</a></h2>
<span id=programming>
<p>So the big todo item is a new ccwrap setup script.  The current one is
the last third of sources/sections/binutils-gcc.sh, and that needs to be
broken up anyway.</p.

<p>Thus I'm splitting sources/sections/binutils-gcc.sh into individual
package builds, and trying to figure out how to handle the fact that some of
them need "setupfor" and "cleanup", and some of them don't.  (For example,
the ccwrap build just uses a single .c file out of sources/toys, and thus
hasn't got an associated tarball.)</p>

<p>Coming up with _a_ solution is easy.  Doing nothing, and having each
script start with setupfor and cleanup when it needs it, is the easy answer.
But it means there's a bit of repeated code in almost all section
scripts, and it seems like that would be easy to factor out and have
build_section do it for you.  But then you have to specify when _not_ to
do it, and the problem is it's done before the script launches so specifying
it _in_ the script is awkward.  My options are grep the script for a marker
before running it, or giving the scripts different names.</p>

<p>This is the hard kind of design problem because all three could work
just fine, it's a question of which option is least ugly.  Having plumbing
like setupfor and cleanup calls repeated in each caller is ugly, because
it's easy to screw up just because you've got to get it right in so many
places, and if it ever needs to be changed it's a pain to track down and
change every occurrence.  But it makes explicit what's happening.  Having
it happen automatically means there's magic behavior you can't see unless
you look somewhere _else_, which is bad.</p>

<p>I can try to mitigate the magicness by making it clear what's going
on.  Perhaps the different names could be meaningful, something like
ccwrap.nosetup?  (For that matter, the "package.sh" names are currently
somewhat misleading because they're not scripts you can run standalone,
they don't include their own prerequisites to define variables and
functions.  Actually the whole build_section handoff is more magic than I like
right now.  If the magic was centralized to there so that's the one
place you had to look and then you understood a lot, that would be
one thing...)</p>

<p>I admit this instance is just a minor irritant, but he tension between
"make it explicit what's happening" and "factor out common code" has been a
fundamental design problem all through this project.  Figuring out
how to satisfy both is always the hard part.</p>

<p>For the moment I can punt, leaving the setupfor/cleanup in place in each
script and worrying about potentially genericizing it later.  Right now,
genericizing the ccwrap script is fiddly enough.  I want it to be able to
wrap the output of the binutils/gcc build stages, but also wrap an existing
cross compiler with a known prefix in the $PATH.  Since the unwrapped
gcc from my build doesn't know where anything is (that's what the wrapper's
for), those scripts should install their output in the right place and
the wrapper should detect if components are already where it expects them
and not wrap in that case.</p>

<p>But what counts as "already installed"?  The prefix-cc gets renamed to
prefix-rawcc, and the wrapper dropped in the old place.  Should that renaming
be done by the ccwrap script, or by the compiler script installing its
output?</p>

<p>Hmmm...  has to be the compiler script.  If ccwrap checks for anything
_other_ than rawcc, then it doesn't know if the rename has already been done
or not, so running it twice would case "issues".</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>I can extract more parallelism from the FWL build scripts.  The
./download.sh stage can be parallelized, including --extract, although that
means teaching setupfor's extract to work in parallel which has always been
fiddly.  (The main problem with creating a $PID directory to do the temporary
extract in is cleaning up half-finished residue from earlier interrupted
extracts.  Hmmm.  Probably a trap EXIT to clean up half-finished tarball
extraction?)</p>

<p>The other thing is moving the rest of the package builds to sources/sections
and then running "maybe_fork build_section" as appropriate.  Most of
host-tools.sh and root-filesystem.sh can run in parallel.  The host-utils
build waits for the busybox build so it can adjust the executable search
$PATH, and then everything else can build in parallel.  The root-filesystem.sh
build waits for kernel headers and uClibc so it can adjust the header/library
search path, and the uClibc++ build has to wait for the glibc build
to finish because of an incestuous link between those.  But I don't think
gcc has to wait for binutils (due to the canadian cross), and the
busybox, make, bash, and distcc builds should be entirely orthogonal.
(Modulo that business with the /bin/sh symlink between busybox and bash,
but I think I fixed that with a config change...)</p>
</span>

<p>Anyway, bisecting the uClibc breakage.  Now that NPTL has been merged
(ignore the obsolete "master" branch, the current nptl branch now has a proper
history and thus supercedes that branch), I'm trying to debug what's
wrong with it.  I'm attempting to build all my old architectures using
the old threading library and the same basic configs that worked with
0.9.30.1, and of course everything's broken.</p>

<p>Bisecting to find the breakage in the current version runs into the fact
that I can't get a clean build from any of the intermediate versions either,
just for different reasons.  (The tree has been crap for ages.)  So when
git bisect comes up with a version, is it "good" or "bad" or is the unrelated
bug merely hiding the one I'm looking for?  So I bisect to find where each
specific bug was fixed and collect patches that fixed 'em.</p>

<p>So I bisected the "undefined NULL" bug to where it was fixed at
git 6d3ed00a41a948.  Doing a fresh bisect the next one I hit was
the "conflicting types for getline" bug.  While looking for where that
got fixed, I saw the bug where it tries to use fcntl64 and can't find it,
and the fun little bug where ldconfig.c explodes with an unexpected
something before 'err'.</p>

<p>I'm trying to bisect one bug!  There are so many things _wrong_ with this
tree that A) I can't isolate the bug, B) I can't get a _good_ build since
the last release to compare against.</p>

<p>This is not a healthy development process.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Pondering an "expect" implementation for toybox.  (Something written in
C, not in tcl.)</p>

<p>When you look at "expect" scripts:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
set timeout 30

expect "login:"
send "username"
expect "Password:"
send "password"

interact
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like all you need to do is write a command line utility that eats
data until it matches a regex (and listens to an environment variable
specifying a timeout), and then pipe data through a shell script.  The "send"
command is essentially just echo.</p>

<p>There are two problems with this.  First, switching the tty in and out of
"raw" mode (so you can match incomplete lines) is a bit of a pain when you
keep relaunching commands.  If you leave it in raw mode when your command
exits, you inconvenience the next command, but if you don't input clumps
weirdly.</p>

<p>The more serious problem is you need a circular pipe.  The input of
"expect" and output of "send" are some other program (though a pipe, character
device, etc), which the expect script is processing.  If you run that process,
and pipe its output into the expect script, you then need to pipe the output
of the expect script _back_ into the first process.</p>

<p>This means you need to run it as a child process of something _other_ than
a shell, because shells don't do that.  Some versions of the netcat command
do that (toybox netcat -l), so I could extend netcat, but that means using
"expect" as a normal command run from the shell doesn't work anymore because
the shell isn't in control anymore...</p>

<p>Ok, looking at the <a href="#14-11-2009">todo list from last week</a>,
Coleman's patch <a href=http://impactlinux.com/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/firmware/rev/891>got integrated</a>, I started
<a href=http://impactlinux.com/code/firmware/FAQ.html>a FAQ</a>, Analyzed
<a href="#15-11-2009">Grzegor'z issue</a> and added it to the FAQ.</p>

<p>My vague poking at the hw-uml target has turned from adding futimes()
to uClibc to fixing User Mode Linux to use futimens() instead.  (Work in
progress.  I posted my futimes() patch to the uClibc list and it
reignited the perennial "the uClibc development process is moribund"
flamewar.  Patching linux looks _way_ more attractive just now...)</p>

<p>Ben Zanin converted the presentation slides to text (all 260 of them),
and cleaned up the HTML a bit.  I added an index and trimmed a couple things,
and <a href=http://impactlinux.com/code/firmware/presentation.html>put it
up</a>.  Yay!  (The
<a href=http://impactlinux.com/code/firmware/downloads/presentation.pdf>pdf
version</a> is in the downloads directory now.)</p>

<p>Jean's ld search path issue and Vladimir's redone snapshots page are
still pending.</p>

<p>At the moment, I'm working on Marc's arm-eabi issue.  It turns out the
problem he was seeing was an issue with
<a href=http://repo.or.cz/w/qi-bootmenu-system.git>his build scripts</a>, which
are based on top of the FWL scripts but extend them to do extensive cross
compiling.  (I had a "Wow, that's impressive!  Why?" moment.)</p>

<p>The problem is he builds a new uClibc and adds it to the
library path with -L, which doesn't remove the _old_ one from the linker
path, and then the two fight.</p>

<p>The reason he used -L is A) It sort of worked, sometimes, when he was
lucky, in the right light, with a tailwind.  B) It was easy to do.  But
my solution is to use a wrapper script (sources/toys/ccwrap.c) which removes
the existing headers and libraries from the $PATH and builds a whole new
set of paths from from scratch.  (You can't make gcc do this itself, gcc
is totally incompetent when it comes to path logic.  You can make it
add stuff to its $PATHs, but the only way to get it to _remove_ stuff
is to tell it to blank them and start over.)</p>

<p>For a while I've needed to write a script wrap an existing toolchain,
building a copy of the wrapper and constructing a new wrapper directory
to put it in.  There are six main paths that compilers look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) System headers (stdio.h, ~/include )</li>
<li>2) Compiler headers (varargs.h, ~/gcc/include)</li>
<li>3) System libraries (libc.so.0, ~/lib)</li>
<li>4) Compiler libraries (libgcc.a, ~/gcc/lib)</li>
<li>5) Tool search path.  (ld, ~/tools/bin)</li>
<li>6) Input files on the command line (current directory, or paths upplied).</li>
</ul>

<p>The only one that gcc _doesn't_ usually screw up and hardwire in strange 
behavior for is #6.  (You'd think #5 would just use $PATH, but no.)  So the 
wrapper has to force all of this, and it does so by assuming that the wrapper 
itself is installed at ~/bin for some ~, and then appends ../lib and such as 
needed to construct the other paths.</p>

<p>The wrapper has a WRAPPER_TOPDIR directory that lets you explicitly feed
it a different value for ~, and Marc suggested I give him more granular
environment variables so he could tell it where to find the things it's not
finding.  Unfortunately, if you start specifying this stuff yourself, you
have to specify at least five different paths, and that's assuming that
Path #4 above is where the compiler's "crtbegin.o" and friends live, and
that path #3 is where the C library's  "crtn.o" and friends live.  (This
is where my setup puts them, but in the wild they can wind up all over the
place what with /lib and /usr/lib and  /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.3/ and
so on.  On Ubuntu, /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux/gnu/4.3/libgcc_s.so is a symlink
to  /lib/libgcc_s.so.1, so the name the linker is looking for isn't in
_any_ of those locations.  Wheee...)</p>

<p>So the fix to Marc's problem is to do a "wrap_compiler.sh" that takes
an existing compiler and sets it up with ccwrap via lots and lots of
symlinks.  There's some design work to do, though...</p>

<p>Adrienne asked why I don't like the new "retweet mangling" misfeature
of twitter, and since there's no possible way to express the horror in 140
characters...</p>

<p>If twitter added a button that quoted a tweet (to save a cut-and-paste),
and enabled the same link to original tweet that "reply" had, that would
be great.  That's not what they did.</p>

<p>Instead, they made it so that it looks like tweets are showing up from
people whose feeds you're not subscribed to.  "Who the heck is this person
and why should I care what they have to say?"  You have to look out of line,
at small print, to see who you _are_ subscribed to who actually posted
this.  (There's a funky "recycle" icon in front of the
tweet, which is light grey on a white background, looks a bit like an @
sign, and is barely noticeable when you're _looking_ for it.)</p>

<p>This is not an improvement over the conventional RT behavior where
"@whoiknow RT @newperson" is right at the start of the message where I
expect it, and the relationship is very clear.</p>

<p>Context is important with retweets: if @neilhimself is retweeting someone
it's most likely a literary reference and probably interesting.  If @simonpegg
is retweeting somebody it's usually some local brit I've never heard of,
or an actor on a show I never saw, and I'm unlikely to care about it.  One
of those is consistently worth a read, one of those is consistently barely
worth a glance, and lumping them together is WRONG.</p>

<p>I'm bad with names.  Every time I see a name in my list that I don't
immediately recognize I have to stop and think "did I subscribe to this
person and they just haven't posted in a while?  Did I misread the name?
Did some spammer crack into my follow list?"  It totally breaks the flow,
and turns twitter from something I can quickly scan and only have to stop
and think about if a tweet is actually _worth_ thinking about, to something
that regularly grabs my attention to resolve problems with no payoff.
This change makes it harder to evaluate my feed.  It becomes _work_.
Half the _point_ of twitter is it's quick and non-intrusive.</p>

<p>So the old way of presenting retweets is superior to the new way,
I greatly prefer the old way, the change is pure loss... but there's no
way to disable it.  I can't opt out.  I CAN'T MAKE IT STOP.  It would be
trivial to make these show up as "@persioniknow RT @personidunno" but
they won't do it, they think their new presentation format is unquestionably
superior, and they're going to cram it down my throat whether I want it or not.
I would rather block _all_ retweets than have to deal with them in the
new format, but they don't give me that option.</p>

<p>Add in the fact that the "retweet beta" introduced itself with pop-ups,
to make sure I had the worst _possible_ first impression, and I couldn't
opt out, and I couldn't figure out how to even send them feedback
about it until Mark pointed out the link on the right (under "direct messages"
and "favorites")...</p>

<p>And that's why I'm looking for a non-web UI for twitter.  They broke
the web UI.  "Kill it with fire."</p>

> Yours, BOBS

The first problem is that busybox is just one part of your router firmware.

What you have in your router is a small Linux system, with three major 
components:

1) The Linux kernel

Usually a 2.4 or 2.6 version, "cat /proc/version" to see which.

2) A C library

Usually either glibc or uClibc.  Do an "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*" and if it says 
libc.so.0 it's uClibc, and libc.so.6 is glibc.  What that symlink points to 
should tell you the version number of the corresponding package.

3) BusyBox.  (Which you know.)

Busybox provides the posix command line utilities, your libc provides the 
system call interface, and your kernel handles resource management and 
interfacing with the hardware.

The second problem is that you need to be able to build code for your target 
hardware.  Your router's processor probably isn't an x86 chip.  It could be 
arm, mips, powerpc, or something else entirely.  You have to find out what, and 
then get an appropriately targeted cross compiler.  If you "cat /proc/cpuinfo" 
it should tell you what processor it's using.  (The uname -m command would 
also say.)

You might be able to get a cross compiler that can use your existing linux 
kernel and C library headers, but that's a fairly precise configuration.  If 
you can't, you'll have to replace the C library and the Linux kernel when you 
replace busybox.

The next question is 'what filesystem format is the router's root partition 
in"?  "cat /proc/mounts" should tell you that one.  You'll also need to figure 
out "how do I write to the router's flash"?  (Does it have a bootloader you can 
get a serial console for?  Or do you have a jtag?  This is another hardware-
specific question, it varies per router.)

Probably the best place to go to ask these sort of questions is the #edev 
channel on irc.freenode.net.  That's where a bunch of embedded developers hang 
out.  There's also a linux-embedded@vger.kernel.org mailing list, see 
http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html for subscription information.

<p>So Grzegorz's issue is that when you type "qemu" on ubuntu when it's
not installed, it says:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
The program 'qemu' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm
qemu: command not found
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Except that the qemu-kvm package only includes the i386 and x86_64 targets,
not any of the others (arm, mips, ppc, sh4...).  It installs the man pages
for the other targets, but not the actual executables.</p>

<p>Heh.  If you run qemu inside qemu, both tell you to hit ctrl-alt to
exit the mouse capture.  (Luckily, the external one is transmitted to the
internal one as well, so you can click on the outer one to give it focus
again but then have your mouse back in the internal one.)</p>

<p>Ubuntu's "qemu" package is just an alias for "qemu-kvm".  The package you
need to install to get qemu-system-mips and friends is "qemu-kvm-extras",
which is crazy because these are pure qemu packages that have nothing to
do with kvm.  The Ubuntu package managers are nuts here, this package name
is actively misleading.</p>

info from him before I can address it.</p>

<p>Vladimir submitted a redone snapshots page, based on stylesheet instead
of tables.  He's got some ideas that could significantly improve the thing,
but since this is largely cosmetic I'm holding off until I get the first
two fielded.</p>

<p>Grzegorz's issue: write up documentation on installing qemu, with a note
about kvm providing the host qemu only.  (I'm actually installing xubuntu
9.10 i386 in a qemu image so I can test installing the debian kvm
package and then installing qemu over it.)</p>

<p>Coleman's issue is probably also documentation: he's trying to
patch uClibc to backport shm_open from uClibc-git, and the patch isn't
taking effect.  (Did he put it in sources/patches?  Dunno.)</p>

<p>Possibly I need a FAQ.  The _volume_ of documentation I've already got
is enough that people don't read it.  The hard parts are keeping it up to
date, and properly indexing it so you can find the answers to questions.</p>

<p>On an unrelated issue, I started doing a script to download the
HTML version of the OLF presentation and do better navigation for it...
And the first slide was 1.6 megabytes.  There are 260 of these!  Downloading
all the slides is most of a CD image!  For text slides with a background!</p>

<p>So yeah, looks like what I should do is just retype the text on those
slides...</p>

<p>So today's accomplishments: make a big todo list of the stuff I'm didn't
get any significant work done on, and then waste hours fiddling with
slides that are already online.  Wheee...</p>

<a name="13-11-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#13-11-2009">November 13, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Twitter is definitely making my blogging somewhat intermittent. :)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>So after shipping the 0.9.8 release, I got feedback that the c++ links
were horked (turned into absolute host paths) by the Great Refactoring,
which was easy enough to fix, and that arm eabi has something subtly
wrong with it, which isn't so easy to fix.</p>

<p>The report of subtly wrong was while cross compiling dropbear, but I also ran
into it while building current uClibc-git:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
path-path-path/gcc/lib/libgcc.a(_divdi3.o):(.ARM.exidx+0x0): undefined reference to `__aeabi_unwind_cpp_pr0'
path-path-path/gcc/lib/libgcc.a(_udivdi3.o):(.ARM.exidx+0x0): undefined reference to `__aeabi_unwind_cpp_pr0
</pre></blockquote>

<p>I'm having trouble reproducing this in a hello world program.  The _divdi3.o
stuff _looks_ like the support code for doing 64 bit math on a 32 bit host,
although maybe it's something looking for a soft-float support function when it
should be using VFP?  Except that I tried a half-dozen different division
variants, and couldn't get the build to fail.  (Unless gcc's optimizer is
considering the return code of printf("hello\n") a constant string and
optimizing out the division via constant propogation even without any
opimizer options?  Maybe?)</p>

<p>At first I was blaming ccwrap, thinking it wasn't sucking in libgcc_eh.a
properly (don't those missing functions live there?), but that turns out not
to be the case.  The library is getting linked in, and according to readelf -a,
libgcc_eh.a seems to include an implementation of __aeabi_unwind_cpp_pr0, but
it's marked hidden?</p>

<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote>

<p>Confusing.</p>

<p>Google <a href=http://archives.free.net.ph/message/20090810.140610.691c6f6c.en.html>found a message</a>
saying this bug manifests when an EABI toolchain tries to use "-mabi=apcs-gnu"
instead of "-mabi=aapcs-linux".  So I'd like to confirm I'm using the right
one of those, except I'm not actually passing those flags in at compile time,
they come from the those funky spec files where gcc invented its own language
for no readily apparent reason.  (I note that "gcc --dumpspecs" says "no input
files", you have to say "gcc -dumpspecs" with a single dash in order for it to
be recognized. Ah, gcc...)</p>

<p>So what _should_ it look like?  The above message links to
<a href=http://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort>Debian's
EABI page</a>, which describes the two ABIs thusly:</p>

<p><b>OABI</b></p>
<ul>
<li>ABI flags passed to binutils: -mabi=apcs-gnu -mfpu=fpa</li>
<li>gcc -dumpmachine: arm-unknown-linux</li>
</ul>

<p><b>EABI</b></p>
<ul>
<li>ABI flags passed by gcc to binutils: -mabi=aapcs-linux -mfloat-abi=soft -meabi=4</li>
<li>gcc -dumpmachine: arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi</li>
</ul>

<p>So it should be getting -mabi=aapcs-linux, -mfloat-abi=soft, and -meabi=4.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/kbentry27>This
page</a> explains that -mfloat-abi=soft doesn't mean we're _not_ using Vector
Floating Point (VFP), it just means that the compiler uses the same ABI for
hardware and software floating point.  (Possibly this means wrapper functions
around the floating point instructions?  Weird.)</p>

<p>So anyway, the output of gcc -v isn't feeding any -mabi option to
collect2/ld, and the only specs snippet that seems relevant is:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
*subtarget_extra_asm_spec:
%{mabi=apcs-gnu|mabi=atpcs:-meabi=gnu;:-meabi=4}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Which looks wrong, and confusing.  (The | means it'll accept two different
ones and what the heck _is_ atpcs?)  This string seems to come from
gcc-core/gcc/config/arm/bpabi.h:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
/* Tell the assembler to build BPABI binaries.  */
#undef SUBTARGET_EXTRA_ASM_SPEC
#define SUBTARGET_EXTRA_ASM_SPEC "%{mabi=apcs-gnu|mabi=atpcs:-meabi=gnu;:-meabi=4}"
</pre></blockquote>

<p>How the HECK is that file getting #included?  (What _is_ BPAPI, anyway?
The comments at the top of the file don't expand the acronym.  It could be
"base port", or it could be some specific system.  I note that nothing
anywhere seems to actually _include_ bpapi.h, so this gets sucked in by
magic build infrastructure somehow, somewhere.  Have I mentioned recently
that I DESPISE the gcc build infrastructure?)</p>

<p>Hmmm, only gcc/config/arm has bpabi, so it's not like each architecture
has a "base" file...  But yes, this seems to be a base file for arm,
because gcc/config/arm/linux-eabi.h says:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
/* At this point, bpabi.h will have clobbered LINK_SPEC.  We want to
   use the GNU/Linux version, not the generic BPABI version.  */
</p></blockquote>

<p>How it got #included, I have no idea, but this gets #included after it
and is already overriding bits of it for other stuff.</p>

<p>Ok, what _should_ SUBTARGET_EXTRA_ASM_SPEC look like?  The acknowledged
experts in this area are the codesourcery guys, so download their
current prebuilt i686-hosted toolchain, make sure it can build hello
world...</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ ./arm-none-eabi-gcc hello.c
/home/landley/firmware/arm-2009q3/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/4.4.1/../../../../arm-none-eabi/bin/ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 00008018

sbrkr.c:(.text+0x18): undefined reference to `_sbrk'
...
</pre></blockquote>

<p>At a guess, that needs to be installed at a magic absolute path, or
needs a special --sysroot command line argument or some such.  I suppose
the docs would tell me, but all I really need is dumpspecs...</p>

<blockquote><pre>
*subtarget_extra_asm_spec:
%{mabi=apcs-gnu|mabi=atpcs:-meabi=gnu;:-meabi=5} %{mcpu=arm8|mcpu=arm810|mcpu=strongarm*|march=armv4:--fix-v4bx}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Ok, I officially don't understand what's going on here.  The Debian
page is saying one thing, the code sourcery implementation is saying
another.  And thus we're back to brute force: take apart the build in
question to see what circumstances reproduce the problem (and that
the symbol being hidden is the root of the problem) and then trace through
the gcc build and try to figure out WHY this symbol is hidden.</p>

<p>More or less finished the <a href=http://impactlinux.com/code/firmware/screenshots>screenshots</a> page.  Looks reasonable-ish.  I still need to fill in
everything but ARM for <a href=http://impactlinux.com/code/firmware/architectures.html>architectures</a>,
and I need to finish <a href=http://impactlinux.com/code/firmware/history.html>history.html</a>,
and completely redo <a href=http://impactlinux.com/code/firmware/documentation.html>documentation</a>,
but hey: progress.</p>

<p>I'm also banging on sparc, which currently isn't booting with uClibc-git.
No idea why.</p>
</span>

<a name="08-11-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#08-11-2009">November 8, 2009</a></h2>
<span id=programming>
<p>So <a href=http://git.uclibc.org/uClibc/commit/?id=0d1ced74e44060d09ff794e28cde0924054c3756>vapier removed</a>
the readelf.c Erik Anderson wrote for uClibc almost a decade ago, apparently
because he couldn't be bothered to understand it.  So I grabbed a copy from
the last release, spent the 5 minutes necessary to clean it up so it built
under glibc, and <a href=/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/firmware/file/879/sources/toys/readelf.c>checked it in</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I've gotten the 0.9.8 release cut and uploaded (if not yet the
website changed so you can actually _tell_), I'm taking a break and banging
on this readelf implementation.</p>

<p>So what you do is you run readelf against a binary, and it tells you what
its headers say, ala:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Type:		EXEC (Executable file)
Machine:	AMD x86-64 architecture
Class:		ELF64
Data:		2's complement, little endian
Version:	1 (current)
OS/ABI:		UNIX - System V
ABI Version:	0
Interpreter:	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
Dependancies:
	librt.so.1
	libselinux.so.1
	libacl.so.1
	libc.so.6
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It's got code to automatically detect the endianness... but not 32/64 bit
word size.  For that, it segfaults, which is bad.</p>

<p>The other problem is the function describe_elf_hdr(), which is pages and
pages of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
    switch (ehdr->e_machine) {
        case EM_NONE:        tmp="No machine"; break;
        case EM_M32:        tmp="AT&T WE 32100"; break;
        case EM_SPARC:        tmp="SUN SPARC"; break;
        case EM_386:        tmp="Intel 80386"; break;
        case EM_68K:        tmp="Motorola m68k family"; break;
        case EM_88K:        tmp="Motorola m88k family"; break;
//        case EM_486:        tmp="Intel 80486"; break;
        case EM_860:        tmp="Intel 80860"; break;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Those EM_BLAH constants live in a header "elf.h", which uClibc supplies a
copy of, and glibc supplies its own copy of.</p>

<p>Why is EM_486 commented out?  Because glibc's elf.h hasn't got it.  Even
though this is presumably a standard file listing constants out of the ELF
standard, the two have fallen out of sync.  (i486 binaries aren't specifically
tagged as such in the ELF header, it's "i386" from the 80386 until you switch
to 64-bit with the Athlon.  Early on some people did but did that mean with
or without math coprocessor?  It fell out of use in the face of pentium,
pentium 2, pentium 3, with or without mmx or mmx2 or 3dnow or...  The ELF
header just isn't that detailed.)</p>

<p>So uClibc's elf.h still has the old EM_486 entry (which you basically never
encounter binaries for anymore), and glibc just dropped it and skipped
that number.</p>

<p>Note that the uClibc readelf.c hasn't built against glibc for years, due
to this kind of mismatch (and some strange makefile magic that meant they
didn't bother to #include the headers they needed at the top).  What dropping
"readelf.c" from uClibc implies is Mike couldn't be bothered to keep uClibc's
_own_ elf.h in sync with its own readelf.c.  That was too much effort.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>So the release notes are finished, the repository is tagged,
I've got about half the screenshots page done, and attempting to go tp
"http://impactlinux.com/fwl/screenshots" gets redirected to
"http://impactlinux.com/projects/firmware-linux.html/screenshots".
(The mirror on my site is still there so
http://landley.net/code/firmware/screenshots works, except that now
the header and footer #includes have been taken out, that mirror has no
navigation cues to get from page to page at all.)</p>

<p>I'm also adding an architectures.html page, and who knows what next
time?  Hmmm.  Gotta get together with Mark and redo the site navigation
entirely.  Among other things, I'd like the left-side menu back.
(Progressive disclosure is great if you want to hide information, but
I'd rather not hide it just now.  If anything I want it _more_ on display.)</p>

<p>Oh well, upload it and clean it up tomorrow.  Only a little more than
three weeks until I wanted to do the next release anyway, gotta get a move
on as they say...</p>

<a name="06-11-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#06-11-2009">November 6, 2009</a></h2>
<span id=programming>
<p>Working on the new <a href=/code/firmware/snapshots>snapshots directory</a>,
and it's slow going.  The only sane way I know how to get it to look remotely
how I want is tables, which don't wrap based on your screen size.  (I suppose
I could just have the whole thing stacked vertically with the links on the
right side of the screenshot instead of under it?  Hmmm...)</p>

<p>As always, writing documentation raises design questions.  Next release
should leverage the BINARY_PACKAGE_TARBALLS stuff to have lots of more
granular tarballs, so should the root-filesystem tarballs still
be the same as the system image tarballs, just packaged differently?
Or should I not _have_ root filesystem tarballs anymore, and just include
directions on how to assemble one by extracting the other tarballs?</p>

<p>The existence of the native-compiler tarballs suggests that root-filesystem
should _not_ have a toolchain in it, but should just be the minimal base system
you can extract the native-compiler into to get what we package up into the
development system images.  Except that sounded good back when root-filesystem
could just be the minimal dynamically linked uClibc+busybox stuff, and then
busybox switched to statically linked by default, so now this "minimal root
filesystem" would just be the busybox tarball produced by
BINARY_PACKAGE_TARBALLS.  (Well, not _quite_ true.  There's the empty
directories (/tmp, /proc, /mnt...), and the contents of sources/native
(the new /etc/passwd, /sbin/init.sh)...)</p>

<p>It's a granularity thing.  Right now, native-compiler.sh doesn't include
things like "make" and "bash", meaning turning a minimal environment
into a development environment takes more than the native compiler tarball,
which implies the native compiler tarball as currently packaged is sort of
useless.  I need to fix that.  How?</p>

<p>Possibly once I've got all the granular per-package tarballs, I should
then a HOWTO on assembling them into a system image.  (It's almost "extract
them all into the same directory", except that some of them assume things
live under "/usr" and some don't.  The ones that don't need to be extracted
_into_ /usr.  Is a HOWTO overkill?)</p>

<p>But having native-compiler as an analog to cross-compiler is appealing.
And having a minimal chroot environment (which would be the sources/native
stuff plus empty directories, and the reason the empty directories aren't
just in sources/native is that mercurial only tracks files, not directories)
would be nice.  And the current root-filesystem tarball has users, people who
chroot into a uClibc development environment instead of running a system
image under an emulator...</p>

<p>Design issues!  Always time consuming...</p>

<p>Anyway, this release is an interim release pricesly so I can get something
out and worry about this stuff afterwards, so I just need to finish up
the release notes and the screenshots page, and write all this other
complication _down_ so I can deal with it later.  (You get a simple result
by working _through_ all the complicated bits.  It doesn't mean the path
to _get_ there was simple.)</p>

<p>So my network is dead, no packets getting routed through the bricked
wireless card.  Ubuntu 8.10 used to let me rmmod and insmod to get my network
back, but 9.04 will kernel panic if I do that.  So I have to reboot again.
And the sad part is I just had to <a href=http://twitter.com/landley/status/5473533667>reboot last night</a> because
of the X11 hang, which is a _separate_ bug but one that's bitten me something
like a dozen times this month.</p>

<p>(So after years of mocking Windows, Linux needs daily reboots to keep a
desktop system running.  Our big argument in _favor_ of Linux is better
code quality, and after 18 years into Linux development every new release
is still full of _regressions_ from the previous release.  That's kind of
sad.)</p>

<a name="05-11-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#05-11-2009">November 5, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Last week I had a phone interview with a manager at Google Europe, and
today I had a phone interview with a Google engineer (although he was in
Oregon, not Europe).</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>So I've got all the binaries I want to release, but writing the release
announcement turns out to be kind of time consuming.  (Muchly documentation
needed.)</p>

<p>This is basically a new entry in news.html, which involves going through
hg commits 810 through 876.  As usual, I keep thinking I haven't done
much until I try to document it, and then there's so much stuff gets lost
in the noise.  (New bug tracker with roadmap!  IRC channel moving!
Prebuilt static dropbear, strace, and busybox binaries!  New sources/more
and sources/sections directories!  BINARY_PACKAGE_TARBALLS option.
New /dev/hdc with /mnt/init.sh!  Fixed powerpc and sh4 to run with stock
qemu!  New armv4tl-eabi target!  Now with more exclamation points!)</p>

<p>Another thing is that Mark made the web page lots prettier, but I can't
personally navigate it anymore.  There's no mention there _are_ additional
pages in the FWL project unless you notice two things that I didn't (Mark
told me):</p>

<ul>
<li>If you hold down the button instead of just clicking, the navigation
buttons at the top of the page turn into pulldown menus</li>
<li>If you hover over the, they're _multi-level_ pulldown menus.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, I have no idea how to _modify_ this setup.  Now that the
nav bar went away, there's no longer any mention of an IRC channel, or
the RSS feeds hg produces for commits and releases.  (And I'm adding a
"history.html" page, which isn't done yet.  And now I'm adding a
screenshots directory.)  How would I add any of those?
Ask Mark to do it, I guess.  Except if I didn't notice this hidden pulldown
menu at the top, how do I expect anybody else to?</p>

<p>The new layout is _pretty_, but I personally have trouble navigating it,
let alone modifying it.  Not sure what to do about that.  I _like_ the pretty,
but...</p>

<p>Also, Mark got a new job.  (The economy sucks, we haven't had enough
clients to keep the company going as more than a part-time thing.  I'm
interviewing elsewhere myself.  This is a great hobby project, but in a
recession nobody's willing to pay for what they can get for free.)  So
I'm not sure how much time or interest Mark is going to have in managing
the website once his new job gets up to speed and starts eating his time
and energy.  (I suppose the same is true for me, one of the Oxford gigs
effectively mothballed this project for months because I just didn't have the
energy to work on it when I got home from work.  *shrug*)</p>

<p>Oh, I'd also like the news.html page to be more than _just_ release
announcements.  Possibly the release announcements need their own page?
I've been posting [LINK] (oct 30, Oct 26, Oct 24, Oct 15, Oct 7 twice, Oct 3, Oct 1,
August 26, August 21, August 20 (twice)) general status updates to the list.
Those should really be in some kind of news blog with an rss feed.</p>

<p>This blog has a lot of me _working_ on stuff, but it's not a summary of
_results_.  Even if you focus on just the "span id=programming" stuff in this
blog (someday I need to updated the rss feed generator to be able to select
just material in specific span tags), lots of it is ruminations about
directions I don't take, vague blue sky plans I won't get to for months,
debugging that results in a three line fix but takes weeks to work out.
What the project needs in a news page is actual _news_.</p>

<p>I suppose what I really want to do in such a news thingy is have posts to
the mailing list that _also_ get posted to a web page (and sent out to an rss
feed), but which you can then go to the mailing list to reply to if you want.
(I suppose I could set up a second announcements only mailing list and cc:
that, but that seems kind of silly.  These aren't necessarily "announcements"
of any import, that would be the news.html page we've got now.  They're news
blog postings along the lines of "what's new this week".)</p>

<p>Eh, I'll figure something out.</p>

<p>The sh4 test fails due to the serial port thing (that's a case of

system image.</p>

<p>I should upgrade smoketest to add a "MISSING" category, but Mark's mostly
written a new expect based version, so I'll wait for that to go in.  (Yes,
the new version is written in Python, but I have different portability standards
for a test harness as for the actual build.  Especially since the test it's
running is so easy to run by hand.)</p>

<p>So the reason the uClibc-git build has been dying all this time is that
vapier decided readelf.c was just too much effort to maintain, and yanked it.
Sigh.  Forked a version to maintain myself, but I'm actually thinking this
sucker might be best done in lua.  (The bulk of it is the big long list
of EM_BLAH values and corresponding strings, possibly it should just parse
the comment fields from the /usr/include/elf.h header.)  Eh, we'll see.</p>

<p>And now the i686 build is segfaulting.  All right, what's going on...
It's the static host toolchain, linked against uClibc-git and really not
working...  Because ccwrap.c is using the malloc functionality of
realpath() and despite arguing about it for a week they haven't actually
applied it to the repository yet, and I didn't make an alt-symlink for
the patch because I thought they had.</p>

<p>I expected "Ew, that's disgusting that the PATH_MAX=4096 size limit is
still there even in the dynamic memory allocation version, you should fix it
_properly_ so it can handle unlimited length paths which is the whole
point of being able to pass in NULL and have it malloc the right length".  I
didn't expect a week of arguing about how to micro-optimize the hack.  (THIS
PATCH IS QUICK AND DIRTY.  That's part of its _nature_.  That's part of
what it tries to _accomplish_.  It's not an implementation detail, it's a
"we've been missing this functionality for years and now SUSv4 requires it,
this at least lets programs limp by".  And yet, they can argue micro-optimizing
the hack for days.  I question the priorities here, but don't really want
to argue with Mike about it.)</p>

<p>Darn it, ported the patch (yes, ported due to gratuitous churn du jour,
in this case they re-wordwrapped the comments before the function so I had
to fix it so the patch applied to the start of the function)... and it's still
segfaulting.  Diagnose it in the morning...</p>

<p>On a related note, Firefox is kind of stupid.  It remembers the 8 gazillion
tabs you had open
before the last crash, but won't let you access or edit the list.  All it
lets you do is "would you like to re-open all these tabs now, or discard them
forever, and no you _can't_ launch a separate instance of the browser even to
look at something local without answering this question".  When the current
hotel wireless access has a login screen (itself stupid, but that's a side
issue), this can get really unpleasant.  Especially if xubuntu's wireless
manager "helpfully" remembered the wireless association and brought it up
when you thought the laptop was offline so they'd all redirect to "could
not access the network" tabs.</p>

<p>In theory, if you're fast ennough you can do a ctrl-alt-backspace to kill
the whole desktop when you see it doing this.  Except Xubuntu 9.04 seems
to have removed this key binding, it no longer kills X11.</p>

<p>It's not that it's broken.  It's not even that this OS is now 20 years old
and still riddled with breakage.  It's that things that _used_ to work
regularly stop working.  There's no positive direction, it's just circling
the drain.</p>

<p>I have the xubuntu-9.10 iso downloaded and sitting there, and when I
get home from Oni-con I need to install it... but I expect it to break
at least as much as it fixes, because they always do.  (And this is _my_
fault for not running the betas and experiencing daily _expected_ breakage
on my laptop.  I still need to buy a Mac.)</p>

<p>Speaking of which, xubuntu popped up a window saying my laptop battery's
down to 47% at maximum charge, which is defective.  This one lasted a lot
longer than the previous nine cell battery did, but it's still getting into
the "put more money into it, or buy a mac" decision time...</p>

<p>We not only got the

but after the monster had finished off all the local humans we A) set it on

poison, D) had poison ivy in the fire so it breathed the smoke, E) the
police who'd showed up to investigate the grisly murders saw the burning
monster and shot it repeatedly.  Pretty much all at once.  (The frightening
part?  This is what I was _trying_ to do.  It came together more or less by
accident, but it was my announced plan and none of the party members died
pulling it off!  Although my rabbit was down to 2 hit points left at the

<p>Didn't get the job I interviewed for last tuesday, but they say they might be
interested in contract work.</p>

<p>In my career I've only really had three "permanent" positions that
didn't start with a built-in timer.  The first one (IBM) I left partly because
I was fresh out of college and wanted to see the world, but mostly because
OS/2 was dying and I couldn't get into Java or Linux development (except as a
tester) unless I left IBM to do it.  (I needed to wait 6 months and 18 months, 
respectively, for IBM to get religion on those two topics.  Oh well.)</p>

<p>WebOffice I rode down into the ground, even going to half-time at half
pay to stay on a bit longer in hopes of making it work, but their problems
weren't something software could fix.  And TimeSys I stayed through four
managers, two CEOs, and longer than 90% of the other engineers.</p>

<p>It's not that I necessarily want contracting more than full time work, just
that my skillset seems to be aimed in that direction.  When things go well,
I fix people's problems and then they don't need me anymore.  (At the other
end are the classing "consulting" gigs where their in-house efforts screwed
things up so badly that they couldn't cope and called in an outsider to clean
up the mess, or at least take the blame for it.  A lot of times that's just
a way of delaying making a hard decision or facing an unpleasant reality.
some consultants milk those for years but I've never had it in me to prolong
a situation just because it pays well.)</p>

I'm making one big baseconfig-uClibc common to all architectures, and

a full-sized .config.</p>

<p>It's ironic that the vim "undo" functionality is the most dangerous
feature in the program in terms of data loss.  If you accidentally wander

<span id=programming>
<p>The reason yesterday's fun little debugging session went so long is
that distcc is fiddly.  The new stuff doesn't manually take a path argument
to where your cross compiler lives, instead it searches the path for $ARCH-cc
and sets up its own set of names for it distcc can use.  Specifically, distcc
wants unprefixed names for all the tools, so the new code searches for
$ARCH-cc out of your $PATH (the "which" command again), figures out which
directory it lives in, gets a list of all the tools with $ARCH- prefixes in
that directory, and populates a directory of unprefixed symlinks to them,
which it then points the distccd $PATH at.</p>

<p>Curning through all the variants of "these symlinks aren't being made
right", we then get to "the symlink is fine, it just won't run because I've
violated the expectations of ccwrap.c".</p>

<p>The point of the wrapper is to rewrite all the paths to point to
header and library directories relative to where the executable lives.  But
this new directory of symlinks lives somwhere _else_, so rewriting all those
paths relative to the new symlinks will give nonsense.  I need to resolve the
symlinks until I find out what it actually points to, and then make the paths
relative to _that_.</p>

<p>The libc function to do this is "realpath()", but that function is deeply
flawed in that its second argument (the new buffer to copy data into) hasn't
got a length argument, and a path could be arbitrarily long.  Once upon a
time there was PATH_MAX, but these days that's only advisory.</p>

<p>The Linux guys fixed this long ago in libc5/glibc so passing in NULL for the
destination buffer would malloc() a new one of the appropriate size,
without which this function is insecure now that PATH_MAX is obsolete.
Unfortunately, uClibc hasn't caught up.</p>

<p>So I sat down and spent the 5 minutes to come up with a quick uClibc patch
to make the malloc behavior work, even if it is just a quick hack that
does an alloca() of a PATH_MAX sized buffer and then strdup()s it on the way
out.  (The returned result can't be longer than PATH_MAX, but the bounds
checking for that was already there.)</p>

<p>(What surprises me is that in the past 5 years nobody _else_ has bothered
to do this.  Oh well.)</p>

<p>I then spent a while debugging _that_, because although it seemed to work
fine at first it turned out the new codepath wasn't triggering because
the compiler was optimizing out the null test.  (Wha...?)  After much
head scratching I traced this down to the function prototype, which
had this strange little __nonnull((2)) annotation on it to let the compiler
know this argument could never be null, although obviously it can.
(At first I thought declaring it char blah[] instead of char *blah was
doing that, but changing that didn't fix it.  No, it's a funky
__gcc_extension.  Right.)</p>

<p>It's also strange that:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
$DO_DEBUG PATH=/blah/blah:$PATH thingy
</pre></blockquote>

<p>tries to run PATH=... instead of running thingy.  Even when $DO_DEBUG
isn't set and thus goes away, the resulting command line doesn't do the
"set variables only for this run of the program" thing unless you remove the
variable expansion, meaning you can't set it to "echo" to display the
relevant commands instead of executing them.  (Enabling tracing mode in bash
isn't nearly so useful because it spits out 20 lines of garbage calculating
port numbers and creating symlinks and so on, not the actual meat of what
the script is doing.)</p>

<p>Must fight with that later...</p>

<p>Took advantage of the marvelous weather and biked to chick-fil-a,
where I spent most of the day implementing
and debugging the new ./run-emulator.sh script plumbing.  It's touched
the top level run-from-build.sh (most of which went away, it's trivial
now), and run-emulator.sh (which got largely rewritten), and I added a
new dev-environment.sh adjacent to run-from-build.sh in each
system-image.sh.</p>

<p>I'm sometimes ambivalent about UI issues because every option sucks.
Way back when I had three scripts which called each other and which you
ran depending on what you wanted.  (This script sets up distcc and calls
this script which adds a home directory which calls this script to
actually run the emulator.)  I threw that out and smashed it all together
into a single run-from-build.sh script with a bunch of command line options,
which didn't actually turn out to be noticeably simpler.</p>

<p>It's also touched sbin/init.sh inside the emulator, although that's
mostly better status reporting, and it also makes sure that /home is
writeable space (mounting a tmpfs on it if you haven't got an hdb).
Although if hda is writeable, that's not really necessarily ideal
behavior either...  (As I said, "ambivalent".  Checking for and handling
a half-dozen different special cases is too complicated and makes the
scripts brittle and hard to read, but _not_ doing it means they won't
always do the right thing.  Lots of sitting down going "ok, what do I
want to accomplish and what's steps cover the most ground for the least
complexity".  Yes, I often spend two weeks pondering before writing
five lines of code, because otherwise they aren't the RIGHT five lines.
Actually they usually still aren't, but they suck less.)</p>

<p>Met a blind guy on the way home, who was standing very still in the
middle of the sidewalk facing a building, and then started slowly inching
his way up a garage parking ramp.  His name was Raymond, and it turns out
he'd locked himself out of his place until morning (when the manager gets
in), and was trying to make it to 6th street where he knew of a 24-hour
convenience store.  (This was 11th and Lavaca, and he was facing east.)
His closest relatives live in San Antonio and Waco, so there wasn't
anybody he really wanted to call on my cell phone, he was just waiting
until morning.</p>

<p>Locked up my bike and led him to a coffee shop that was open another

Distcc is fiddly.  The reason yesterday's fun little debugging session

<p>Largeish ripping-a-new-one of the run-emulator.sh code underway.  It's
always been easy to build the appropriate target and then use run-from-build.sh,
but it's been a bit of a pain to download the right system-image (and
cross-compiler) tarball and hook them up in the right way to get a development
environment.  The command line for that is too long and fiddly and not properly
documented.</p>

<p>So the NEW way to do it is to download system-image-$ARCH.tar.bz2 and
extract it and run dev-environment.sh out of that.  That gives you the
256 megs of ram and 2 gigabyte hdb.img.  If you want the distcc accelerator
trick, you also need to download cross-compiler-$ARCH.tar.bz2 and add its
bin directory to your $PATH.  (Or extract that tarball into the
system-image-$ARCH directory the first tarball created, or into your home
directory.  It'll automatically pick it up from either location even if it
isn't in the $PATH.)</p>

<p>So I'm redoing the script so it sets up distcc based on the $PATH, and
adding the new wrapper script dev-environment.sh that defaults 256 megs of
memory and creates a 2 gigabyte hdb.img if it isn't there.</p>

<p>I'm also removing all the old command line arguments that used to just
set environment variables.  It's just as easy to set the environment
variables directly.</p>

<p>The run-emulator.sh also announces when it DIDN'T find the components for
the distcc accelerator trick, and why.  (Either couldn't find distcc, couldn't
find $ARCH-cc in $PATH.)  And init.sh should also indicate whether or not
it's using distcc.</p>

<p>(It would be nice if there was some kind of distcc smoke test it could do.
I've had way too many "it thinks distcc is working, but it isn't really"
occurrences.  The static native build logs are a good way of noticing next time
I break that, but it would be nice to get something properly automated.)</p>

<p>Heh.  Over in another corner of the project, the reason that uClibc-git
on sparc wasn't behaving like I expected is that the file you put in
sources/targets/sparc is "miniconfig-alt-uClibc", not "alt-miniconfig-uClibc".
Oops, my bad.  That _would_ explain why the symbols in there weren't taking
effect. :)</p>

that was a really good one.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>I think a better way to do the --with-distcc stuff would just be to grab
the appropriate $ARCH-prefix compiler if it's in the $PATH.  Then
run-from-build.sh could just adjust the $PATH rather than passing in a magic
command line option.</p>

<p>User Interface questions are always fiddly, there's lots of things that
could work and you have to try to figure out what's easy to understand and
remember.  This has the advantage that you can set it up and have it work
automatically.  I should have run-emulator.sh spit out a line if it can or
can't find the compiler, so you have some feedback.  (It's not like there's
a shortage of kernel boot messages at the moment anyway, although a --quiet
option might not go amiss...)</p>

<p>Last time I chose "stable, long-term position I should be able to spend

they approached _me_ rather than the other way around...</p>

<p>So the powerpc thing is somewhere between 2.6.28 (which works) and
2.6.29 (which panics as soon as interrupts are enabled).  Unfortunately,
in between is a long stretch of null pointer dereferences in the IDE
driver, and after calling :git bisect skip" over two dozen times it's
still noddling around in there.</p>

<p>Why can't git bisect skip chip off 1/3 from either end and look
_there_?  Testing commits adjacent to the one that didn't work is highly
likely to find another one that also don't work for the same reason.
Testing 25 adjacent comments in a range of several thousand is
ludicrous.  Pick a point 1/3 from either end instead of halfway between
them, which should at least get you away from the error, and then if you
continue bisecting from there it should introduce enough jitter to bypass
it entirely if it isn't a particularly huge range.  But having to rebuilt
dozens of commits is not helpful.</p>

<p>Also, when I "git bisect skip", the number of commits to test goes down
by one.  Honest and truly it does, because I TESTED that commit.  The
results may have been inconclusive, but that's not my fault.</p>

<p>Found it.  The <a href=http://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/linuxppc-dev/2009-October/076727.html>powerpc serial problem I reported</a>

<p>Laptop had the X11 hang again.  Essentially lost the day's work
in the reboot.  (Not all the work, but context and what I was doing was
all in the open windows.)</p>
</span>

<span id=programming>
<p>Reading my LUA book.  (I've got a job interview tuesday morning for
a company that A) looks cool, B) is local, C) uses LUA.  Yay!  An excuse to
give this the time it needs to properly learn it.</p>

<p>What impresses me about this language is how stunningly minimalistic it
can manage to be while still accomplishing everything it needs to.  It's
so SIMPLE.  For example, the book points out that "A and B or C" is almost
equivalent C's "A ? B : C".  (The and gets evaluated before the or, so it
becomes (A and B) or C.  If A is false B gets evaluated.  If A is false B
doesn't get evaluated, but C does.</p>

<p>The corner case is if A and B are both false C still gets evaluated, but
in Lua "0" isn't false.  Only nil and the special boolean typed value "false"
are false, so "max = (x > y) and x or y" works as expected even when x is
0.  Yeah, it's funky in that it _doesn't_work_like_C_.  (The whole
arrays starting from 1 instead of zero thing is also going to bite me
a few times before I get used to it.)  But by slightly adjusting the
assumptions it's been able to jettison about half the complexity of other
languages, it just doesn't _need_ a lot of the constructs you take for
granted elsewhere...</p>

<p>This is a noticeable step up from Python, which is now a completely
different language than when I started learning.  (Python 2.1-ish, circa 2001,
didn't even have generators.  I've picked up a few of the new contructs
as it went along, but by no means all.  By Python 2.5 we were already well
into "new language" territory, and then Python 3.0 made it explicit.  They
could easily have called it "anaconda" or something, they just wanted to move
their existing userbase to the new language.  Yeah, I need to learn Python
3.0 at some point.  Knowing "Python 2.3 or so" isn't the same thing at
all.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mark is learning Ruby.  He seems to be enjoying it immensely.
I should probably learn that one too, I've heard good things about it, and
oddly enough todaty I've been reading
<a href=http://beginningruby.org/what-ive-earned-and-learned/>about</a>
a Ruby book, if not actually reading said Ruby book...</p>

<p>I am totally going to have to read the LUA runtime source code.  I have
theories about how they implemented some of this...</p>

<p>Trying to prevent Eric from turning into RMS, via email.  Long, draining,
tiring thread I'd much rather not be involved in, but Beth called me last
night all upset and had me confirm that the email he'd sent her was _actually_
from him (it was that out there), and it sort of snowballed from there.</p>

<p>I really hope this thread doesn't go public.  It won't just wind up
on slashdot, it'll wind up on _fandom_wank_.</p>

<span id=entertainment>
<p>Spent most of the day out with Stu's daughter Beth, and with Mark.
Visited a toy store, a bead store, and a "general goods" store that
sold rubber ducks in the shape of celebrities, candles scented like flowers
I couldn't name (but Beth could), and enough 1950's diner style plates and
utensils and syrup pitchers and such to launch your own diner.</p>

<p>The north drafthouse location has already stopped doing the Toy Story
special feature in 3D, so we saw Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (me
for the second time, Beth for the first).  It continues to be awesome.</p>

<p>Then went downtown to meet Mark and see Master Pancake Theatre mock
"Nightmare On Elm Street" (which oddly
is _not_ to the tune of "21 jump street", nor to "Life in the fast lane").
Their theory that Freddy and Michael Jackson are related has some merit
(both wore a fedora, were badly burned, had a trademark single glove, peaked in
the 80's, had disturbing interactions with children, and are now dead).
Good to see Owen back with the group, even as a guest.  It's a family
thing.</p>

<p>Since the downtown drafthouse is on 6th street, we all went to see 6th
street.  Mark showed us several bars.  There's one called "Pure" whose
theme is antiseptic sterility.  The place is scented with various cleaning
agents, and their tables are solid sheets of plastic lit from underneath
to glow blue.  (The ground floor is all blue-lit.  The top floor is all
red-lit.  As far as we can tell, the building is heading downwards at
a significant fraction of the speed of light, but it seems to be ok with
that.)</p>

<p>And I found the coffee shop on 4th street where you can order S'mores.
You pay the money and they bring to your table a tray containing a pile of
marshmallows, graham cracker pairs in little plastic packets, hershey bars,
little wooden sticks, and a metal pot containing fire.  (Sterno or something,
they light it at the table and it burns for 10-15 minutes.)  You then toast
the marshmallows and make smores, there at the table.  It's a wonderful
thing.  The marshmallows, graham crackers, and chocolate were surprisingly
well balanced but we almost wound up asking for more fire.  (It was close
at the end, we talked for too long.)  I probably shouldn't have eaten the
third S'more, but it was really good, and Mark drove Beth home so I got to
walk it off.</p>

<p>Over in FWL-land, I'm juggling lots of non-working platforms.  Interest
in sparc has resurfaced, and current uClibc-git has a lot of fixes.  It
also doesn't build busybox, because include/utime.h isn't getting
installed.  (I don't know why, I've got CONFIG_SCREW_SUSV4_CODE_ACTUALLY_USES_THIS
set.)</p>

<p>The powerpc panic seems to be due to the <strike>Poppy Z. Brite</strike>
PMACZILOG serial driver, which panics as soon as interrupts are enabled
(I.E. right when the kernel launches init).  The issue might be fixable by
bisecting back in the history and finding the last time the driver worked,
or it might be fixable by switching from qemu -M g3beige to the mac99
one, which is apparently less badly maintained?</p>

<p>No progress on Alpha or m68k recently.  I think if qemu hasn't got a
board emulation for it, then it's not a FWL 1.0 release target.  That does
mean I should dig up and dust off the xylinx/microblaze patches, though.</p>

<span id=smof>
<p>Last night, I went to an organizational (possibly too strong a term)
meeting of the Texas LinuxFest.  This is the second local austin convention
that I could probably take over and turn into a "Linucon jr." if I really
wanted to put in the effort, but again once again starting over from scratch
managed to seem like the easier approach.</p>

<p>The meeting was scheduled for 7pm, I arrived about on time and sat outside
with the other people who had been locked out: the building we were meeting in
locks as 7pm.  Luckily the guy delivering pizzas had the number to call, so
they let us inside where we ate the free pizza and sodas.<p>

<p>I believe the total attendance at the meeting was 6 people, if you include
me.  They had about as many again on speaker phone, although only one (David,
from his Dell office up in Round Rock) actually spoke that I recall.  (On the
bright side, this meant there was plenty of leftover pizza and we all got to
take some home.)  Apparently the google group has about 40 subscribers.</p>

<p>They have no con chair, but believe that things can get done via committee
or general acclaimation.  The guy whose idea it was attended and ran the
meeting, but doesn't want to be con chair.</p>

<p>They're actually not very interested in a combo sf/tech event ala
Penguicon or Linucon.  They have an existing "Linux Fest" model that
they're following, which I'm only passingly familiar with, largely due to a
lack of interest on my part.  (Note that actual technical events like Ottawa
Linux Symposium don't fall under this model: that's not a "fest".  Ohio
LinuxFest counts, though.)</p>

<p>They hinted a few times that they were looking for people to step up and do
stuff, but it really doesn't sound like my kind of fun, nor are they interested
in me trying to add my kind of fun to their event.  They know what they want
to achieve (in an extremely vague sort of way), they just seem to want somebody
else to do it for them.</p>

<p>They have no venue, no speakers, no preregistrations, but what they do have
a name, an event date, and lots of verbal agreements with sponsors.  Apparently
five figures worth of sponsorship if everybody they have verbal agreements with
comes through.  I didn't ask about bank account or incorporation details, but
my impression was right now they haven't bothered to set up either.
(They did mention two existing 501c3 entities that might want to handle
money for them, if/when they actually get some.)</p>

<p>Despite their lack of venue, their event date is in six months.
No venue candidates were presented during the meeting (they haven't visited
any sites or gotten any of the little information folders the places give
out).  Finding some is the first item on their todo list, and they hope to
meet again in a month to see if they have something by then.  (They can't
change the event date because it's one of the only things anybody knows for
sure about the event.)</p>

<p>They were interested in the new facility UT built on MLK, or getting
space at UT or St. Edward's, but have no
students or professors involved in organizing the event.  I brought up doing a
call for papers to attract interest from professors (and corporate researchers),
but I'm not sure there's enough time left to do one properly.  (I tried to work
out a rough schedule for them starting _now_, but nobody wrote anything down.
Doing a call for papers raises a lot of complexity I don't think they're
prepared to deal with anyway.)</p>

<p>My venue candididates don't really help, because a one day (saturday-only)
event means people are probably not going to travel to it, so doing the SF
con thing of bartering room block for function space means that schedule
deprives them of any significant number of room nights to barter with.  They
also have to work setup and teardown into their day, or rent the facility for
extra time on adjacent days, for vendors only, not attendees.  (I suggested they
ask armadillocon for a run-down of the local hotel function space anyway, even
if they're paying cash it gives them more options.)</p>

<p>Admission is free, which explains why there is no preregistration mechanism.
(Why would you preregister for an event that's free at the door?)  The
downside of this is nobody's committed to coming until the last minute,
at which point it's an impulse decision either way and easy to decide not
to bother because you have nothing invested in it.  (On the other hand,
since they're not using attendee registrations to pay for the event and
aren't bartering a room block, on a financial level it doesn't really seem to
matter whether anybody actually shows up or not.)</p>

<p>When I asked about the focus of their event, they used the phrase "big
tent" to confirm an intentional lack of focus.  They said their intended
focus is "open source" in general, but I pointed out the name they've chosen
is more specific (Linux only, and again they can't change it because it's one
of the only concrete things you can say about the event, plus their "Linux
Fest" model).  When I specifically asked about open source on the
Macintosh (in theory built on Darwin), or users of Firefox and such on
Windows, or even things like
<a href=http://jwz.livejournal.com/1100218.html>Jamie Zawinski's struggles to
get Dali Clock running on his Palm Pre</a>,
they said they didn't see those as significant sources of open
source development effort.  So they have a certain amount of focus due to
both lack of interest, and to the unintended consequences of their name.
(Apparently non-Linux can go hang, except for the BSD guys that slavishly
chase every occurrence of Linux to say "me too" and the FSF guys who try to
stick a GNU/Dammit on it.  Both were brought up at the meeting, although not
quite phrased that way.)</p>

<p>I asked about tracks (embedded, supercomputing, server, desktop, kernel,
network security, desktop usability, programming, performance, debugging...),
and they seemed to think that was a bad idea.  They said having lots of
different panels might make more people come.  (For the one
panel that interests them?  Ok.)  But also that panels aren't really of much
interest, because it's not what the half-dozen people in that room (except
for me) went to other LinuxFests for.  The main draw for them seems to be
hanging out with the vendors.  (They did mention their distro sponsorships
might lead to a lot of distro guys coming, so presumably they could put
together a track about... repository management and package integration,
maybe?  Not sure.  It was at least a theme.)</p>

<p>I asked "where's the shiny?" and explained I wanted to know what excited
them about this thing, which they might want to communicate to their
potential attendees.  They couldn't come up with anything specific.
The idea was that their companies had sent them to other shows around
the country (as vendors), and they didn't like having to travel out of Austin
to go to Linux shows when there's so much high tech in Austin.  So they
want lots of vendors hanging out with each other, here in Austin.  (I note
that Door64 has arranged two of that sort of event in the past 6 months,
neither of which I went to.  As far as I know, the Texas LinuxFest guys and
the Door64 guys are not aware of each other's existence.)</p>

<p>They specifically mentioned basic introductions and tutorials when asked
for example panels, and they're looking forward to giving out lots of distro
CDs, which they saw as an asset forming one of the big draws of the event,
and I see as the modern version of AOL coasters.  It seems to me that the
people who would go to a LinuxFest are people who already using Linux, and
thus not the target market for basic introductions and distro CDs?</p>

<p>I did get a _little_ accomplished.  I pointed out that their google group
was set so you have to log in to view the archive, and they confirmed it and
promised to fix it.  I explained about the "heartbeat blog" of Penguicon's
first year, and they thought that was a good idea, and that they'd ask on the
google group if anybody wanted to do that.  (The guy currently doing the
website was there and said he'd actually just volunteered to let them use
his server, not to create and maintain the actual website for them.  As
far as I can tell, there wasn't a single position anybody there wanted
to _do_.)</p>

<p>Oh well, at least they updated their twitter for the first time in almost
2 months, mentioning the organizational meeting less than 2 hours before it
happened.  (Wheee?)</p>

<p>I don't know what they want.  I don't know what they're trying to do.
I don't see how I can help, or why I'd want to put much effort into it.
I note that Stu, Mark, and Linas all declined to come to this meeting,
and they didn't need to see it to make this decision.</p>

<p>Sigh.  If I want another Penguicon/Linucon-style event, it looks like I'm
going to have to create one myself.  Repurposing other events doesn't seem
to work, whether it's a tired old event like Armadillocon actively looking for
new blood and new ideas, or a barely-there event like Texas LinuxFest looking
for somebody to take over and do it for them so they can be vendors at the
result.  It's just not what they _are_, it's too far from their self-image
to bend that way without losing their identity.  And maybe too weird an idea to
explain until you see it in action.</p>

<p>Oh well.  If it's free, I'll probably still go and see how it turns out.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Finished factoring out busybox and toybox, and checked them in.  Several
other small cleanups too.  Not fully recovered, but definitely feeling
better.</p>

<p>Trying to benchmark static vs dynamic busybox under qemu, using the good
old make 3.81 "time ./configure" to do it.  (Even in a host build of that
package, the configure stage takes three or four times as long as the
compile, tarball extraction, and install _combined_.)  It's pretty
much the patholigical case for emulated native builds, and thus a good
thing to try to optimize.</p>

<p>First run, dynamic busybox:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
real	2m 35.02s
user	1m 49.66s
sys	0m 42.62s
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Second run, dynamic busybox:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
real	2m 36.14s
user	1m 50.54s
sys	0m 43.64s
</pre></blockquote>

<p>First run, static busybox:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
real	2m 6.95s
user	1m 26.56s
sys	0m 37.86s
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Second run, static busybox:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
real	2m 3.66s
user	1m 25.53s
sys	0m 36.18s
</pre></blockquote>

<p>So it shaved off 30 seconds from a 2.5 minute job, for just under a 20%
speed improvement.  Nothing to sneeze at.</p>

<p>Alas, 99% of what this ./configure seems to be doing is lots and lots of
little calls to gcc (which is still dynamically linked, and brings in the
distcc transaction overhead which is at its worst for really small compiles and
also still dynamically linked).  You'd think the compiler itself would have
some way to go "is this header there?", "is this function there?"... but no.</p>

<p>Still, it does imply that if the _entire_ root filesystem was statically
linked, we'd see more speed improvement.  Worth a poke.  (After all,
BUILD_STATIC is there already... :)</p>

<p>First run, static everything:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
real	1m 56.20s
user	1m 13.31s
sys	0m 40.79s
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Second run, static everything:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
real	1m 58.68s
user	1m 15.38s
sys	0m 41.61s
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Right, so making busybox static is worth 20%, and making everything else
static is worth another 5%.  Good to know, but it looks like only busybox
is worth building statically by default.</p>

<p>I should ask the list...</p>

<p>Busy day, very little of it programming.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>On the programming front, I managed to tell people _twice_ to test code
that I hadn't checked everything in for.  (I really hate having a cold.)
Got a little done on factoring out BusyBox, but my brains weren't quite
together enough to poke much on even that.</p>
</span>

<p>Took a bus to pick up the car, which was fixed for under $250.  (Yay Ike's
automotive on Anderson.)  Bought an energy drink along the way to be up for
this (there was some significant walking involved, and it's not so cool
anymore, and the liquor store on The Drag sells the orange mango passion fruit
rockstars I like).</p>

<p>Said energy drink wore off while Fade and I were at Mark's playing The War
on Terror.  (Fade spent about 1/3 of the game as the Evil of Empire, because
Axis of Evil landed on her color the third time we spun it.  I got a picture
of her wearing the Balaclava of Evil, but it's still on my phone.  She's
warned of dire consequences if it's posted for general oogling.)  Alas,
the game has a mechanic that people can drop out at any time, which
makes all their cities turn into terrorist units, and after somebody did so
with 1.3 billion (because they had to leave) it was largely inevitable that
the next player to turn terrorist (and thus control all those units) would
win, rather than any of the empires.  Oh well.  (I was 2 victory points away,
having grabbed Antarctica and Australia early and put 3 cities on each.)</p>

<p>As I said, energy drink wore off around the time a second player turned
terrorist, and we let the terrorists win via general acclaimation.  (When
an energy drink is wearing off to let a cold reassert itself, Penguin mints
just don't cut it.)</p>

<p>Then it was "catch up on errands" time, now that we had the car back.
I was only up for groceries, laundry will have to wait...</p>

<p>I hope the cold ends soon.</p>

<p>So the downside of the new online bug tracker is that when I'm not
online, I can't check the roadmap to see what needs doing next.  This
is especially annoying when my laptop decided to do the X11 hang again
(Ubuntu 9.04 is almost as stable as Windows 95 was; second forced reboot
this week) so I had to reboot and lose all my state, so I don't remember
half the things I was in the middle of doing becaue all the open windows
are gone.</p>

<p>Oh well, I still have <a href=http://impactlinux.com/fwl/roadmap.txt>roadmap.txt</a>.</p>

<p>Darn it, my repository is completely horked.  I pulled from mirell's
repository, and doing so reverted the last half-dozen commits of mine,
because it had decided that "tip" was now mirell's branch without my changes.
So I told it to merge, and it complained that I had local changes.  What
the heck does that have to do with anything, I'm telling it to fiddle with
the _repository_, not with my locally checked out files.  They're two separate
things!<p>

<p>So I told it to "force" the merge, and this did something but didn't
fix the problem.  I tried doing it again and it said I had an outstanding
uncommitted merge.</p>

<p>How the hell do you have an uncommitted merge?  It's a merge commit!  That's
what a merge commit DOES, take two already committed commits and glue 'em
together.  Ordinarily when I tell it "hg commit" without arguments, it
goes through and finds all my changed files and tries to commit them
all, but I don't _want_ it to do that.  I want it to commit this abstract
"merge" object, which somehow didn't get commited when it got created for
no readily apparent reason.  How do I specify an abstract object that
doesn't have a location in the filesystem?  Why would I NEED to?  What
POSSIBLE use does having it in an uncomitted state have?</p>

<p>So I told it "hg rollback", hoping this would destroy the commit
844 from Mark and put me back at commit 843 where I understood the state
of my repository.  That's not what happened.  Instead, the repository went
away.  Completely.  When I go "hg log -v", I get _nothing_.  The entire
project history is gone.</p>

<p>This probably has something to do with branches, but "hg branches" says
nothing either.  I have once again gotten the repository into a state
where the project's maintainers would probably go "how did you do that", and
I want it to stop RIGHT NOW and I'm ready to take a hex editor to the
repository to make it happen.  (Luckily,  I haven't rsynced yet.)</p>

<p>I'm never pulling from an external tree ever again.  Mark's change was
a one-liner, and I lost a day of work because of it (and confused poor
wangji who was trying to use the new work I'd done that mark's commit erased),
and I didn't even learn anything (other than "don't ever do that again").</p>

<p>Ah, figured it out.  I'd forgotten that before I did the rollback (expecting
trouble), I tarred up my working directory, blew it away, and did a fresh
checkout.  (In an attempt to make that darn uncommitted merge commit go away,
and also to give me an empty working store to do the merge in.)  The rollback
didn't undo the last commit, it undid the _clone_.  (Yay shell command line
history showing the actual commands I'd typed, even when I don't remember
them.  I hate having a cold.  I also hate having to try to figure out what
the mercurial developers were thinking when they implemented a given non-obvious
behavior.  Still light-years ahead of git, but that's damning with faint
praise in spades...)</p>

<p>Alas, when your hearing starts to go, you don't percieve a restricted

<p>Banging on powerpc.  Laurent Vivier pointed me at a
<a href=http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/powerpc/>page with debian qcow
images</a> that run under qemu 0.11.0 just fine (and even manage to have
-hda set /dev/hda).  I grabbed the /boot/config-2.6.26-1-powerpc out of that,
and did a "make oldconfig" under 2.6.31 to bring it up to date.  Took a bit,
lots and lots of of new symbols.</p>

<p>If you try to run the debian image -nographic, the bootloader figures it
out and talks to the serial console, but the Linux kernel does not.  I
fought with said bootloader for five minutes trying to figure out how to
feed it a new kernel command line.  If I type "help" it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Enter the kernel image name as [device:][partno]/path, where partno is a
number from 0 to 16.  Instead of /path you can type [mm-nn] to specify a

<p>(Of couse it also says that if I type "walrus".)</p>

<p>It doesn't say what by "device:" options are (or partno) for that matter.
(Dos drive letters?  hda?)  If I hit enter it'll boot a default, but it won't
tell me what string I would have typed in to _get_ that default.  It does
tell me that the kernel command line is "init=/dev/hda3 ro", but not how
I'd go about supplying an alternative.</p>

<p>Not very impressed with this bootloader.</p>

<p>So I built a 2.6.31 kernel with the new config, using the powerpc cross
compiler I've been using all this time (which built a kernel that booted up
to userspace before), and it produced four different arch/powerpc/boot/zImage*
files, all of which crashed instantly with an illegal instruction when
I pointed qemu-system-ppc at 'em.  A quick check of my
sources/targets/powerpc/settings showed I was running the vmlinux (that's
the unpackaged ELF image in the root directory), and sure enough that
got as far as prom_init where openbios handed off to the kernel.  Roughly
where the original debian kernel was failing to talk to the serial console.
Even when I append console=ttyS0.  (It's looking like this kernel hasn't got
serial console support built in?  No, menuconfig says it does...)</p>

<p>Ah, there's more than one type, and the 8250 emulation appears to have
been replaced by the zilog one.  Right, <a href="#02-08-2009">I remember now</a>,
it's console=ttyPZ0 now.  *shrug*  As long as it works.</p>

<p>Ok, using Debian's kernel .config (more or less), and debian's root
filesystem, and the exact same qemu, the kernel panics when using the serial
console and doesn't when using the emulated graphics card.  It's userspace
trying to talk to the serial console that causes the problem.</p>

<p>It's always something.</p>

<p>So I've got the native static builds building, and I've got the timeout
code working, and I decide I need one more cleanup because passing in
QEMU_EXTRA="-hdc /path/to/hdc.sqf" has a whitespace problem.</p>

<p>An absolute path from root could have spaces in it.  I don't know what
your system's paths look like, you could have a windows background.  Heck,
Mark left spaces in the URL to the slides from OLF, because he's using a mac
now and macs do everything through a pretty GUI.  It's easy to let spaces
sneak in, and I have to support them.</p>

<p>The problem is, shell scripts suck at dealing with spaces.  They have
the "reparse command lines" problem with whitespace the way perl has the
"list context vs scalar context" re-parsing problem where _it_ loses track
of similar grouping information unless you stand over it and hit it with
a stick.</p>

<p>The -hdb "$HDB" (and -hdc "$HDC") argument(s) should be optional,
therefore the easy thing to do is set WITH_HDB="-hdb $HDB" and let
that resolve to nothing when it's not set.  But that can't have quotes
around it or -hdb and its argument become a single item that qemu can't
parse.  Unfortunately, if $HDB has a space, then _that_ becomes multiple
command line entries.  Doing WITH_HDB="-hdb \"$HDB\"" means the quotes become
literal characters considered part of the filename, meaning "temp dir"
would be the worst of both worlds: two separate arguments but each containing
a quote character.</p>

<p>This constant wrestling with whitespace is pretty much the bane of
shell programming, and the bugs it causes don't usually happen on _my_ system
because the path from root to my firmware directory hasn't got any spaces
in it.  (Possibly I should move it into a subdirectory that _does_ have
them, just so these problems are forced to manifest so I can fix 'em.)</p>

<p>Ordinarily I quote the heck out of everything to try to deal with this,
but in this case I'm not quite sure how to go about it.  Feeding -hdc ""
to qemu is probably going to make it try to open an empty filename;
even if I make $HDCARG a variable that doesn't need to be quoted and will
thus drop out if empty, the quote arguments don't drop out when empty.  So I
want to group spaces, but not have empty arguments persist, and
those aren't orthogonal in shell...</p>

<p>This is trivial to do in something like python.  There's a _reason_ people
don't try to do complicated stuff in shell anymore.  But I'm not introducing
more environmental dependencies.</p>

<p>What I really want is something like the "$@" behavior where an array
turns into a block of arguments with its original grouping level (regardless
of spaces).  Unfortunately, "$@" is a magic one-shot special case the shell
people put in to deal with command line arguments, not a general facility
available to shell code in other contexts.  (And dealing with arrays in
shell is black magic anyway.)</p>

<p>I can re-quote the command line and then feed it through "eval", which
always makes me think I'm opening a security hole, even though this is local
code that doesn't take arbitrary third party input data.  An advantage of
that is I can echo the command line before running it.  The result isn't
remotely _simple_ anymore, but the echo might make up for that.  (Cut and
paste _this_ to run it yourself.  Even if you have to run the script rather
than reading the script to see how it calls qemu.)</p>

<p>Well, even the echo isn't trivial.  I'd have to echo the un-evaled line
in order to have the quotes show up in the output (without which cutting
and pasting and re-running the line means things like -append's big long
argument block won't be aggregated).  But if I do that, the command line
will get re-parsed based on spaces for echo, so any occurrences of multiple
spaces between lines will get squashed to one space, tabs will get squashed
to spaces, etc...</p>

<p>Sigh.  The designers of shell really weren't thinking about general purpose
programming when they did it.</p>

<p>I suppose I could put one big occurrence of single quotes around it and
then use double quotes for everything I do inside, and hope none of the data
contains any single quotes.  No filenames with apostraphes.  No, I'd have to
process the data to escape them (and escape backslashes), and how do you
process the output without echoing it through sed or some such?  By using
more bash extensions.  Grrr...</p>

<p>Such a simple issue should not open a can of worms.  That's poor language
design, right there.</p>

<p>Yesterday I <a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2009-10/msg00757.html>poked the qemu list</a> about the curses problem again, and today
it was completely ignored, zero responses and buried under a flood of new
posts.  (Just like last time.)</p>

<p>I also wrote up fairly extensive data dumps on why I expect to rename the
project when the 1.0 release comes out (giving the reasoning and potential
new names), and a way too long post about why using uboot under emulation
is more trouble than it needs to be (by explaining how linuxbios, bochs
bios, bootloaders like grub, and the early kernel boot actually work).</p>

<p>Not a lot of programming yet today, I biked to the transmission place
to help them reproduce the funky noise my car was making (it mostly only

<p>Ah, I figured out what's going on.  I stuck some printf() calls in the
qemu source code to see why the curses code was triggering, and it isn't.
The curses thing _was_ fixed during development, the current escape codes
that were being so weird are busybox ash, trying to figure out how big
the display attached to the serial console is.  (Exporting LINES and COLUMNS
stops it, but it doesn't actually cause the problem the curses thing did.)</p>

<p>Mark and I are playing with <a href=http://redmine.impactlinux.com/projects/impact>a new bug generator</a>.
(Yes, I'm voluntarily submitting to one this time.  Call it personal growth,
call it "this isn't bugzilla".)  I'm trying to beat behavior out of it
that's an actual improvement over a <a href=http://lists.impactlinux.com/pipermail/firmware-impactlinux.com/2009-October/000325.html>text file roadmap</a>.
So far it seems nice, and in need of much configuration.  Luckily, Mark
is good at this sort of thing.  (He can touch stuff without breaking it
immediately!)</p>

<p>And Alpha needs the #ifndef inhibit_libc fix I've been applying to sh4.
(The gcc-core-fix-inhibit-libc.patch thing.)  GCC really isn't all that
well-maintained, is it?  The FSF doesn't regression test bootstrapping its old
architectures...  Hey, and the "-O2 causes internal compiler errors during
the uClibc build" issue that m68k had _also_ applies to Alpha.</p>

<p>After you've gotten your first dozen platforms working, you really do
start to spot patterns.  "Anything maintained by the FSF is crap" is a
pattern.</p>

<p>And I didn't get around to banging on the qemu -rc releases before 0.11.0
dropped, I'm hoping the curses issue got fixed.  By default, qemu's new
./configure enables curses support if it detects you've got it on the
host, and curses mode isn't scriptable.  (It craps escape sequences randomly
into the output, which confuses things like expect.)</p>

<p>During development, curses mode was enabled by default, but the current
source code (in vl.c) looks like -nographic and -curses are unrelated.  Here's
hoping...</p>

<p>Nope.  It's still broken.  Time to ping the list...</p>

<p>The "um-fest" that is our Ohio LinuxFest talk is now online.  We managed
to compress an 8 hour talk into 54 minutes, which is about like doing the
minute waltz in 11 seconds.  We did it by eliminating all the hands-on
parts, and the actual demonstrating the software parts, and skipping maybe
1/3 of the slides entirely, and skipping about half the material on the
remaining slides, and then ZIPPING through the rest as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The result was exhausting for me to listen to, and I _wrote_ it.  It's
fairly dense with insufficient breaks, but that's pretty much unavoidable
when you compress a topic that much, even with such lossy compression....</p>

<p>The reason it turned into an "um-fest" is we didn't practice enough at
the faster speed, so the normal delivery pace full of _pauses_ had to have
all the pauses eliminated, meaning I went "um" between every point while
waiting for the next slide because I _knew_I_couldn't_stop_talking_.
(And the longer ums are us advancing past skipped slides.  And I even
got Mark doing it during one section...)</p>

<p>It's slightly less embarassing if you think of "um" as the "advance slide"
signal, but still... :)</p>

<p>The first minute with a DJ trying to be funny is just inexplicable, but he
came with Ohio LinuxFest and when he asked us for a summary of our company
and I gave him the "Impact is how you get embedded" line and...  well, listen
for yourself...</p>

<p>Oh, the "Max Headroom" delivery is because OLF bought eeepcs to record the
talk, and apparently didn't take flash write latency into account (nor
test long enough for it to manifest).  It's in the original flac, not an
mp3 encoding artifact, alas.  (Yes, realtime issues affect the real world.
Who'da thunk?)</p>

<p>But hey, <a href=http://www.archive.org/download/OhioLinuxfest2009/44-Rob_Landley_and_Mark_Miller-Developing_for_Non_x86_Targets_Using_QEMU_vbr.mp3>the recording is up</a>!  (And the slides are

</span>

<p>Due to a sudden interruption I
<a href=http://landley.livejournal.com/41208.html>actually posted to
livejournal</a> for the first time in ages, for reasons explained in the
entry.</p>

<p>Where was I?</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Right, what I'm trying to do is monitor the output of a qemu run, and
exit if nothing's come out for 60 seconds (meaning it's hung).  A bit like
smoketest.sh does now, only using the new -hdc /mnt/init logic to
drive the emulator.</p>

<p>My first thought was to pipe the output into a function
that does {while read -t 60 i; do echo "$i"; done} and thus exits,
hopefully ending the pipeline.  Except that this would batch the data into
lines, meaning the "..." of tarball extraction won't progress, you'll get
nothing until it's done and then the whole line at once.  And in ./configure
the delay between "testing..." and "ok" would display nothing until the whole
completed line pops up at once.  (May not seem like a big deal, but it's
darn irritating when a human's looking at the output and trying to figure
out what's going on.)</p>

<p>My second thought was to fix the dispaly problem using tee, ala
<p>"./run-from-build.sh | tee >(while read -t 60 i; do true; done)".
<a href=http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2004-May/045755.html>Long
ago</a> I fixed tee to pass along data promptly, without batching issues (and
fixed
<a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0503.3/1756.html>User
Mode Linux's tty layer</a> to handle similar issues: short writes to stdout
happen people.  Yes busybox tee implementation, this means you, not
bothering to check the return value of fwrite() to see if it spit back some
of the data.  You can make this happen with ctrl-z, or sending a kill -SLEEP
to the output process.  A loaded system will do it when it schedules the
target process away long enough for the pipe to fill up, or swaps out one
of the target process's pages so it blocks on I/O.  I _really_ need to
implement tee in toybox, without this funky FEATURE_TEE_USE_BLOCK_IO code
duplication, or gratuitous mixing of posix and ANSI I/O idioms...)</p>

<p>Anyway, this still wouldn't address the "one big long line" issue, because
partial input data doesn't reset the read timer.
(Quick test: while true; do echo -n .; sleep 1; done | read -t 5 i" and it
times out after 5 seconds.)  But it would be progress: if it worked.</p>

<p>However, tee continues on when one of its outputs ends, meaning the
pipeline won't end.  And more to the point, even if it di the "hopefully" two
paragraphs back turns out to be misplaced, because even when you output directly to
a function, which exits, it turns out the pipeline doesn't exit
until all the component programs do.  The producer will get a SIGPIPE next
time it tries to write to the consumer through a closed pipe, but if it's
hung and not producing output this will never happen, so the pipeline won't
exit, defeating the purpose of the exercise.</p>

<p>So what do I do?  Add a ; kill $PPID right after the "done".  A kill
signal going to the parent pipeline kills it, but not the whole shell script,
which is exactly the behavior I want.  Control passes to the next line down
(to kill the netcat+ftpd instance now that it's no longer needed), and
life is good.</p>

<p>The remaining issue is the "tarball ... progress indicator" issue above:
big ones like the 50 megabytes of bzipped Linux tarball can legitimately
take a full minute when extracting under an emulator (eating CPU to decompress
and then creating 30,000 little individual files takes some doing, plus it's
blocking on a lot of disk access to flush all those dentries).  The
dotprogress function prints a period every 25 files, but the timeout is
how long since we've seen the last newline.</p>

<p>So it's not ideal.  What I really need is either a shell "read block of
data but not necessarily until the next newline", which is unlikely to exist
(and looping on single characters in shell is too CPU intensive), or 
a timeout in the tee command itself (of which there aren't any yet)...</p>

<p>Ah!  But there _is_ a -n option to limit the number of characters it
reads.  So if I set that to say 32, I can still read large enough chunks that
I'm not spinning doing a whole shell loop for each character of input, but
it can return when the ... line gets long enough.</p>

<p>Sigh.  Except it's _not_actually_working_.  Small chunks of it worked
in my tests earlier, why is it failing when I try it on securitybreach?
(Different version of bash, perhaps?)</p>

<p>Taking the UT shuttle bus up to Far West to pick up my car from the
mechanics (the engine is fine, they're guessing the weirdness is the
transmission).  I like Lamb's automotive, they didn't charge me for
something they couldn't fix.</p>

<p>I'm amused by the number of different wireless networks that xfce keeps
popping up and then disconnecting from.  (Keep in mind it only attaches
to ones I've previously given it permission to use.  I bike around a lot. :)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Haven't rsynced in a couple days, because Mark's redoing the website
to look less horrible than my hand-edited html.  (He's even adding a style
sheet. Ooooh.) Which unfortunately means that if I just rsync before I check
his changes in, I'll stomp right over 'em.</p>

<p>Alas the drop he gave me last night turns all the URLs everywhere into
absolute URLs, so when you browse the local "www" directory in your downloaded
source, all the links point to impactlinux.com.  And he stripped the ".html"
extensions off them all, for reasons I don't understand.  Torn between just
checking it in and washing my hands of the website (which probably means I'll
never update it again), and drawing out a process that would be fairly
simple if I wasn't in Mark's way...  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Checked in the armv4tl-eabi target today, thanks to Marc Andre Tanner.
I should rename the old armv4l to armv4l-oabi, since it's the only oabi
target....</p>

<p>Continuing to bang on an automation script.  Trying to build an
expect in bash is frustrating enough I've given up for now, and instead I'm
adding infrastructure to automatically mount /dev/hdc on /mnt if it exists,
and then hand off to /dev/hdc/init (if there is one) instead of firing up
the shell prompt.</p>

<p>Alas, getting the data back _out_ (without requiring root on the host)
is kind of tricky.  It turns out that dropbear is really picky, it won't
run if your current user isn't in /etc/passwd, and since there currently
_isn't_ an /etc/passwd in the system images, it won't even work for root.
So I can't just scp the data out like I'd wanted to...</p>

<p>Pondering.  There are a half-dozen approaches I could do, but so far
I'm not happy with any of them: The netcat trick's brittler than I like.
Writing a tarball to the start of one of the existing virtual drives has
several problems (hda and hdc are shared, read-only, and in use at the
time I'd need to write the tarball.  hdb is just /home and stops being used
when we exit, but that's where the data I need to copy _from_ lives.  I
_could_ partition home, but how much space do I give it and finding the
offset to start reading the tarball from is icky.  Adding a fourth drive
for output seems kind of silly, and I haven't even tested that all the
targets I'm messing with have _three_ yet...)  Catting data to stdout via
uuencode or something and then intercepting it just won't scale.  I'm not
sure I have a second serial port to do the &gt;(process) trick to.  Exporting
a directory via nfs from the host requires root access, and doing so via
samba requires samba to be installed on the host (it went gplv3, I'm not
building it from source in host-tools) and smb support in each target
kernel...</p>

<p>I suppose there's busybox's ftpd on the host and ftpgetput in the client.
Or I could just add a one line /etc/passwd to the system image and make
another stab at getting dropbear to do this for me.  (The downside is if

<p>Taking the advice of the community building panel from OLF and writing
up a Firmware Linux roadmap, so people know what the upcoming TODO items
for the project are.  (Mark and I know them, but who else does?)</p>

<p>Building static versions of strace and dropbear for mipsel, because
somebody on the list asked.  In order to make this part of the nightly
cron job, I have to write an "expect" variant in bash.  (I've already
written on in python, back in the timesys days, so it's not that hard.
And I've implemented timeout code in smoketest.sh.)</p>

<p>What I need to do is make a library function for sources/functions.sh
that waits a specified number of seconds specific string (possibly a regex)
to wander by.  If the string happens before the timeout, it returns success.
If the timeout happens first, it returns failure.</p>

<p>Fairly straightforward to specify, darn fiddly to implement in shell, but
I've already got most of the pieces.</p>

<p>I may also need to split up sources/functions.sh into bits only useful
to FWL (download, cleanup, setupfor, read_arch_dir, and so on) and bits
generally useful to anybody building inside an emulator (killtree comes
to mind).</p>

<p>Or perhaps I should split it into API functions meant to be called by
users, and internal functions only meant to be called from the api
functions...</p>

<p>Ohio LinuxFest was fun, and really busy.  Tired.  Airplane back now.</p>

<p>Doug McIlroy was cool (and so was his talk, I hope they post the video
and slides).  It was good to see Beth again (she was a co-worker of mine at
Timesys, and the con chair of OLF this year).  Mark's and my talk seemed fairly
well received and several people poked us about getting the slides online (we
told 'em to check the Impact Linux website wednesday).  Didn't get to hang out
with Peter Salus much (my talk was scheduled opposite his), but I bought his
new book from the Barnes and Noble booth.  Met Mackenzie Morgan.  Suggested
that Ubuntu call its new bootable USB hardware test image "magic smoke".
Got tips on how to add Hercules/S390 support to FWL from David Boyes (who
is not the lawyer, but apparently gets his airplane seat upgraded all the
time because airlines _think_ he is).  My name got

<p>Ohio being just south of Michigan, several people told me about how the
technical programming for "Matt Arnold's Penguicon by Matt Arnold"
apparently imploded this year.  (I'd heard the con suite ran out of food,
and the brazilian beef went so badly they decided to strike its name from
the program book and never speak of it again.  But this is the first I
heard about the technical programming.)</p>

<p>For the record, A "call for papers" requires you to send out
acceptance letters well ahead of time, and have people confirm they're
coming.  Failing to reply to the submissions at all until 3 weeks before the
event, and then emailing submitters the the schedule grid with their talks
already on it, really is not the same.  (Politeness issues aside, submitting
a paper is not the same as making travel arrangements.)</p>

<p>Charging admission to those who do show up, when this was never mentioned
to them before, doesn't improve matters.  (The whole handicap access issue
is sort of a rounding error at that point, although not the people directly
affected by it.)</p>

<p>Still, attendees sitting in empty rooms with no speakers in them didn't
seem to bother the organizers (just the presenters and attendees), so no
harm done there then.  (Then again thhis year was the first year I didn't
attend, so I'm working on secondhand information delivered months after
the fact.  I didn't even hunt down and read lots of con reports like I
did for all the previous years.)</p>

<p>Speaking of "for the record", I should write up a "History of Penguicon".
I did co-found the thing, work rather extensively on organizing it for
5-ish years (1, 2, 4, 5, and a smattering of 3 and 6).  Plus it's got a
year and change of history that predates even Tracy, that _only_ I know
about... :)</p>

<p>- Sun Tsu, The Art of War</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Republican party is not just the party of "no", it's the party of
"stupid".</p>

<p>You can trace the "party of stupid" trend back to Ronald Regan, an
Altzheimer's patient who Dave Barry described as "napping towards glory".
But it got _bad_ under the man who put the "duh" in W.</p>

<p>George W. Bush was not a smart man.  That was obvious (and widely remarked
upon) during the 2000 election.  He had a certain animal cunning, but
that's not the same as intelligence.  "The Decider" was not a thinker, he
did not enjoy solving problems and seldom if ever pondered the ramifications
of his actions.  The entire Iraq War was condemned by the simple failure to
even once consider the question "then what?"  They didn't have a _bad_ plan,
they literally had _no_ plan.</p>

<p>When he couldn't simply lash out at a problem with overwhelming force, his
only other option was to hunker down and wait for it to go away, whether
reading "My Pet Goat" to school children while the World Trade Center
burned, leaving Bin Laden hiding in a cave through the end of his presidency,
or refusing to cut short his endless vacations for Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<p>An old military adage is that amateurs study tactics, the experienced study
strategy, and professionals study logistics.  These people DID NOT STUDY.
They waged two wars plagued by constant failures of "intelligence" in more
than one sense, and kept threatening to invade more (Syria and Iran near
the top of the list).</p>

<p>The self-styled "education president"
championed "Intelligent Design" while dismissing climate change.
(His legacy in education was the disastrous No Child Left Behind act, perhaps
a response to the way education left him behind.  Ask any teacher how slowing
the entire class down to the speed of the slowest student worked out in
practice.)</p>

<p>He was _viciously_ anti-intellectual.  He didn't value the advice of
smart people (nor did he want to be surrounded by them, choosing instead
"Heck of a Job Brownie" and the "Duct Tape and Plastic Sheeting" guy).
He especially distrusted science and scientists, ordering them to change
or bury their conclusions when he didn't like them.  </p>

<p>Back in the 1970's, the long-running BBC science fiction program
"Doctor Who" contained the quote "The very powerful and the very stupid have
one thing in common.  The don't alter their views to fit the facts.
They alter the facts to fit their views.  (Which can be very uncomfortable if
you happen to be one of the facts that needs altering.)"  Bush was very
powerful, _and_ very stupid.  He put a man in charge of NASA, Michael Griffin,
who not only eliminated weather monitoring programs because he (like Bush)
didn't believe in global warming and didn't want to collect data that might
contradict this belief, but who publicly _admitted_ it.</p>

<p>What he did respect was wealth and power: obvious, measurable,
superficial signs of success.  Thus his energy policy was written by oil
industry lobbyists, even as the price of gasoline neared $4/gallon.
His fed chairman came from Goldman Sachs, and due to insufficient regulation
and even less enforcement that Fed chariman needed to give an enormous
bailout to his former employer (and selected other companies, but _not_ to
Goldman's largest competitor which was allowed to go under) towards the end
of the administration.  But Bush thought corporations could do no wrong
(since they were the ones who understood stuff he couldn't be bothered to
ask about, yes even after Worldcom and Enron and so on), and thus everything
must be deregulated and privatized from the
military through the FDA, with disastrous consequences.  (Anyone remember the
massive pet food recall because nothing had been tested for contamination?
We deployed _mercenaries_ in Iraq, from Blackwater to Wackenhut: forget
about Abu Ghiraib "naked prisoner human pyramid" stuff for a moment, is it
really a good idea to outsource the functions of the US military to
organizations that answer to the highest bidder?  It's like the companies
that outsource all their employees to India and then are _shocked_ when
overseas competitors emerge.  The scandals ran together
to the point it was hard to even remember them all.)</p>

<p>This man was in charge of the Republican party for eight years. 
This attitude shaped everything.  Being smart and educated held no
weight, science was a matter of opinion.  And it left its mark.  The
people in charge now are trying to cash in, just about exclusively,
on the Stupid Vote.</p>

<p>Half the "appeal" of ex-beauty-queen
Sarah Palin is that she's similarly convinced that anything she doesn't
understand can't really be all that important.  (She has, of course, been
replaced in the party's mind by younger, prettier, dumber beauty queen Carrie
Prejean.)  Does Joe Wilson really _believe_ Obama was lying, or is he simply
trying to appeal to the willfully uninformed and easily confused?  How is the
"anti-Czar" hysteria _not_ an attack on Ronald Regan?</p>

<p>Lincoln was the one who pointed out you can fool some of the people all
of the time, but he didn't consider it a _good_ thing.  His party's
current leaders (Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Bill O'Reilley) have made
a _career_ out of it.</p>

<p>I really hope these guys go the way of the Federalists and the Whigs,
and maybe the Blue Dogs can split off to become the new opposition
party.  Unfortunately, our system has a whole lot more inertia baked
into it than in 1861, and Lincolns are hard to come by.  Our winner take
all voting system brings out the loonies during the primaries, and trying
to fix the electoral college and such seems out of fashion again.</p>

<p>Bisecting kernels is a pain.  Found the commit that made serial output
happen again (a10b32db348), saved it into FWL as alt-linux-blah.patch,
bisected back into the middle of the dead range, and applying the patch
didn't produce any output.  So the fix consisted of multiple patches, and
I have to bisect for the other one.</p>

<p>Or I could do what I'm doing, which is finding the _beginning_ of the
damaged range and seeing if I can revert _that_ patch.  (And also confirming
that the bug I'm looking for wasn't introduced before then, which would
make it much easier to find.)</p>

<p>And I immediately hit yet another bug.  Let's see, the bug I'm looking
for in -rc1, the no output bug, the two different build breaks towards the
end of the no output bug, and now this one.  Fifth bug.  Wheee.</p>

<p>This bug (in 8a1ca8cedd) makes qemu exit immediately after launch with
an "unauthorized access" and then
<blockquote>
<pre>
qemu: fatal: Trying to execute code outside RAM or ROM at 0xa0000000
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is what the sh4 emulation does when trying to reboot itself
anyway.  But the point is, this is yet another different behavior, which
doesn't prove that the one I'm looking for _isn't_ in this one, just
that something else is happening.  It could simply be preventing the
problem I'm looking for from manifesting.</p>

<p>And since nobody ever tests platforms like sh4 in the presence of hundreds
of random other changes raining down, git bisect skip remains useless because
it tests adjacent commits and when there are sometimes 750 of them with the
same bug (as there were last night with the first of the two build
breaks)...  Sigh, no better ideas, and I have a book.  Skip, skip, skip,
skip, skip (each one is a 5 minute build)...</p>

<p>Hey, it relented after only about an hour of building.  That's pretty
quick for using "skip" in a kernel bisect...</p>

<p>Interesting.  Looking for the front of the "no output" range, I
started hitting ones that behaved like -rc1 and ones that booted all the
way to a shell prompt, so apparently the bug was introduced before the
lack of output (yay!), but get this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
There are only 'skip'ped commit left to test.
The first bad commit could be any of:
f19900b2e608b604777a74d6d711bbf744657756
8be5f1a68f2c14082939dd54e7037dcee2eb54f8
We cannot bisect more!
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The f199 commit (sh: remove old TMU driver) dies without any boot
messages (it seems to hang a bit and then exit), the 8be5f commit (sh:
Kill off the remnants of the old timer code) manifests the -rc1 hang.
So the introduction of the hang and the failure to output anything were
adjacent commits, both messing around with what looks like the timer code.</p>

<p>Poked the kernel and qemu lists about it, since I dunno which one needs
the fix.  (I know the kernel is what changed, but it looks like they
switched from one time source to another, and qemu may only have been
emulating the first.  Since the qemu timer stuff for sh4 was already kinda
horked (or at least there were long inexplicable delays), properly emulating
the new one might be an improvement?  No idea, worth a ping.  (This is,
of course, assuming the sh4 guys tested it on real hardware.  Which may
not be the case.)</p>

<p>This is why I need to get the cron job stuff working, and running
a _reliable_ smoketest rather than the current one with intermittent
race-condition failures probably attributable to virtual serial port
initialization delay jitter eating a non-constant amount of data when
qemu gets unexpectedly scheduled.  (The sad part is that the previous
sentence _isn't_ Star Trek technobabble, it actually makes sense to me.
I need to go do something else for a bit.)</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder if the people who invented "git bisect" ever actually
use it?  You'd think they'd _have_ to, but the "git bisect skip" option
seems to assume that any broken commits are fixed almost instantly, and will
happily test a dozen adjacent commits rather than going "splitting it in half
didn't work, let's try lopping off 1/3 and maybe we can avoid the damaged
range that way".  No no, there's never a broken commit that nobody notices
for hundreds of revisions, so let's make you test EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
THOSE.</p>

<p>I'm trying to bisect for the sh4 hang in the 2.6.31 kernel (it's not
getting to userspace, it's hanging during kernel bootup; 2.6.30 booted fine
with the same compiler, config, root filesystem, etc).  The hang was there
in 2.6.31-rc1 and is still there because apparently nobody ever tests
non-x86 targets in mainline.  (I need to, that's why I'm getting everything
else fixed so I can do so more easily.)</p>

<p>I've already had to change what I'm bisecting for once because most of
the range between 2.6.30 and 2.6.31-rc1 gives no boot messages at all,
rather than spitting out several dozen and then hanging.  So now my
definition of "good" is not getting any boot messages, so I can find the
end of that range.  But then I hit a build break, and of course skip skip
skip and it's still there because git bisect skip is really stupid.</p>

<p>This is why I didn't spend much time on it in my old
<a href=/writing/git-quick.html>Git bisect HOWTO</a>, because you wind
up having to checkpoint and do speculative bisection all the time.  You
find stuff you can't test for whatever reason and have to change what
you're bisecting for, generally to bisect for the patch that fixed
whatever this problem is and then go back and apply the patch to the
last one you wanted to test for the _previous_ problem and continue your
bisection from there, patching as appropriate.  (Or bisecting for the
start of the range and reverting that patch, same difference.)</p>

<p>So now I remember that c4c5ab3089c8a794eb0bdaa9794d0f055dd82412 build
breaks and 0dd5198672dd2bbeb933862e1fc82162e0b636be reproduced the "no
output" problem, and of course that's what git calls them because it's not
like humans use this stuff.  Just kernel developers.  And I change the
definition of "good" again to call the problem I'm seeing "good".  If
the problem goes away but I see the no output problem, then it met
the inner two definitions of "good" and I can continue bisecting for the
patch that fixes the no output problem.  If I instead get the original
hang then I find the build break patch, back up to the "build breaks"
commit above (doing a log dump and reply like I described in my HOWTO),
apply the patch and test, figure out whether it reproduces the previous
nested problem I was looking for, and go from there.</p>

<p>Yes, this is the HOWTO I deleted off kernel.org because some idiot found
it confusing that I didn't put much emphasis on "skip" and I didn't feel
like arguing.</p>

<p>Hey, and once I got after the dma_sync_single break, the sh4 build breaks
in a _different_ place.  Most likely the first break was hiding the second,
so i'll have to bisect for this one again, so I should remember that
650a10dc484f067883fc05a2d4116e1ee3f909c0 showed this second problem.  In
the meantime, bisect for the patch that changed the bug I was looking at,
so this one would be "bad"...</p>

<p>Ooh, 09ce42d3167e3f20b501fa780c2415332330fac5 builds to the end (so
the second break was introduced afterwards, I think?), and it shows the
-rc1 bug behavior.  Ok, that's still not the one that fixed the bug I was
looking at, so call it bad.  (Aren't these horrible names?  It's "before"
and "after".  Note that good _must_ be before, you can't bisect for where
a bug was fixed by calling the after "good".  Git won't let you.)</p>

<p>*blink*  Ok, d246ab307d1d003c80fe279897dea22bf52b6e41 has the -rc1
hang behavior, and 692684e19e317a374c18e70a44d6413e51f71c11 has the no
output behavior, and both build, and according to git bisect they're
something like 4 commits away from each other...  Good sign?  Sheer luck?
Possibly git bisect doing something strange?</p>

<p>Um, let's see, that means I call the no output one... bad?  Good?
Darn it, I've forgotten.  (Does bad mean before?  No, git always
assumes bugs are only introduced, never fixed, so bad means after, meaning
I've done it wrong.  Sigh.  The bug I'm trying to FIX is "good", the
behavior where it's fixed is "bad".  Because it's git.)</p>

The neighbor who can't park, and who has an even dozen bottles of alcohol in
his window (yes I counted, although the only two I remember were vodka and
everclear), was outside with a friend of his being loudly racist.  Apparently
secret service people finding a guy with a sniper rifle near the white house
is a laugh line, although a bigger laugh line was "What did they think he was
going to do?  Shoot the black guy!"  (This was after he insisted to
his friend that he was going to get an NFL contact because he had a dream
about it  All done in a heavy rural southern accent, of course.)</p>

<p>This is the one neighbor who has remained constant since I
bought the place.  The others come and go, but this guy stays, because his

<p>The rebuild with the toolchain build scripts unified and the 2.6.31 kernel
finished, and the targets to break this time are mipsel (but not mips), sh4
(build break in uClibc), and armv4l (but not v5l or v6l).  Off to
diagnose...</p>

<p>Ok, testing mipsel by hand, it worked.  There's some kind of funky
asynchronous failure in smoketest.sh, which is probably a qemu thing and
most likely has to do with catting a script into stdin without some kind
of "expect" functionality.  I wonder how hard it would be to write "expect"
in bash?</p>

<p>The armv4l problem seems the same, it worked for me building on my
local laptop.  The sh4 thing is that once again the asm types
#ifdef guard changed (due to the sh 32/64 unification), so uClibc's
bits/kernel_types.h needs <strike>to be redesigned from scratch</strike>
updating.  Whipped up a quick patch and submitted it to the uClibc list.</p>

<p>The gating issue on my todo list is getting The Great Refactoring
to a good stopping point, so I can regression test the existing builds

<p>Next up after that, I borrowed Mark's BeagleBoard and I need to finish

so I can build the x-loader and such for beagle.</p>

record.  "What if indigestion could sing, and tried to be morose without
actually sounding Russian?"  And now it's drunk, gargling, and singing
about "tabletop jones" in the presence of a disinterested piano.  I'm
fairly certain this is intentional, I'm not sure why.</p>

<p>I spent rather a lot of last night trying to unify the binutils and gcc
builds for The Great Refactoring, and I've made it up to the wrapper stuff.
Now I'm trying to figure out if the wrapper and uClibc++ builds should be in a
big binutils-gcc script, or if they should be split out.</p>

<p>The individual binary package tarballs complicates matters, of course.
The package tarballs grab the new files between setupfor and cleanup, and
since ccwrap.c isn't in packages (it's in sources/toys) it doesn't get
packaged.  (Currently the wrapper build is done before the gcc build's cleanup
is called, so that's not an issue.)  Plus building the wrapper shuffles
around a lot of the gcc files, and there's no way to represent _moving_ files
in a tarball.  So packaging the wrapper by itself is problematic.</p>

<p>However, one of the goals of The Great Refactoring is being able to drop
in replacements for various components: a glibc build instead of uClibc, a
different compiler (tinycc, llvm/clang, pcc, or even a GPLv3 version of gcc)
instead of the last GPLv2 version of gcc, and so on.  The wrapper is currently
tightly tied to the current gcc build, but other compilers might need it
too.  So if I want to do a drop-in replacement script to build binutils 2.18
and gcc 4.3 (for armv7l/beagleboard) obviously the script should only do that.
But a binary package tarball of gcc that _doesn't_ contain ccwrap is kind of
useless.</p>

<p>Perhaps I need to do the symlink approach, and do a null setupfor just so
I can package the wrapper?  I'd still need to move gcc->rawgcc, though.  It
MIGHT be possible to break off the wrapper build, but do I want to?  Hmmm...</p>

<p>In any case, I should be able to eliminate the redundancy between
cross-compiler.sh and root-filesystem.sh describing how to build the same
packages in slightly different ways.  That's the _other_ big goal here,
not having to repeat the busybox build between host-tools.sh and
root-filesystemm.sh, not having almost the exact same the uClibc build sequence
in both cross-compiler.sh and root-filesystem.sh, and so on.</p>

<p>If I want to do a drop-in replacement script to built binutils 2.18 and gcc
4.3 (for armv7l/beagleboard) obviously the script should only do that.
But a binary package tarball of gcc that _doesn't_ contain ccwrap is kind of
useless...</p>

<p>And then there's the whole export of the funky static c++ support library
so uClibc++ can suck it in and use it.  That's a very ugly handoff between two
different packages.  I suppose I could just treat it as a very ugly
prerequisite.  And right now, uClibc is separated out from the toolchain build,
so I suppose separating out uClibc++ makes as much sense.</p>

<p>Wheee.  Design issues.</p>

<p>Much rain.  Waited 2 hours for it to let up enough I could bike home from
<strike>the mug of unity</strike> <strike>one mug's</strike> Einstein's
Bagels this morning, and eventually biked home through the rain anyway.  Autumn
isn't supposed to start around here until mid-december, I thought?  Climate's
being weird.  If an indian summer is a warm week after the first frost,
I guess a week of fall coming a couple months early would be... a pilgrim

<p>Another fun shell corner case, the "VAR=VALUE command" syntax works
with source statements.  Ala "VAR=VALUE . snippet.sh" will export VAR=VALUE,
read in and execute shippet.sh in the current context, and then set VAR=VALUE
back to whatever it had been before.  Essentially, source statements have
their own shell function context.</p>

<p>Good to know, and quite useful for the refactoring I'm doing.  I'm
considering making the snippets be sourced so I don't have to say #!/bin/bash
at the top of all of 'em.  (I'm still ambivalent about the bash dependency
and would love it if busybox ash grew the extensions I'm using.  I need to
test that, and possibly fix it.)</p>

<p>Also poking at the BeagleBoard HOWTO, hoping to get it finished this

<span id=programming>
<p>Trying to merge the cross-compiler.sh and root-filesystem.sh scripts (at
least the toolchain portions) is educational, even though I wrote it.  I'm
looking back at these flags and asking things, like why is the cross binutils
build explicitly specifying AR AS LD NM OBJDUMP and OBJCOPY, but the canadian
binutils build only specifying CC and AR?  Why are they _different_?
Or for that matter, why is cross specifying --with-lib-path=lib but the
canadian one isn't?  (I think it has to do with that "lib64" but on x86-64,
but don't quote me on that.)</p>

<p>I'm trying to squish this into one codepath, and it's _not_ a straight
line.  And binutils is only 1/10th as evil as gcc, the FSF hasn't _really_
maintained binutils for a decade now.  (It was Cygnus, which got bought
by Red Hat.)</p>

<p>Alas, this means I probably need to do more investigation.  Possibly I
need to look at my old blog entries, although I doubt I recorded what I was
doing in enough detail.  (For example, OBJDUMP all caps doesn't previously
appear in this year, 2008, or 2007's blog entries.)  I can dig through "hg
annotate" to see where it was checked in, but most likely it was one big
lump with a single comment.  What I want to know is what happens when
each of those isn't specified.</p>

<p>The thing is, over-specifying stuff can give me a build that works for
all three of my use cases (creating a basic cross compiler from host
to target, canadian crossing a native compiler for the target, and canadian
crossing a cross compiler from an arbitrary host to an arbitrary target
statically linked against uClibc on its host, ala i686->arm build on an x86-64
host).  But it also accumulates cruft.  How much of this is still needed
for the 4.2.1 build, and how much was 4.1.2 only?  What breaks if I try to
spin a 4.3 toolchain (which, alas, armv7 needs and that's what the shiny
new Cortex A8 in the BeagleBoard is using).</p>

<p>What I probably have to do is get the big overspecified one working, and
then yank each symbol one at a time and run all three build variants
without it to see what happens.  And that's incredibly boring and time
consuming.  Oh well.</p>

<p>It's so easy to slap stuff together to make it work once, and always so
much extra work to do it _right_.</p>

<p><a href=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/09/i_will_not_read.php?page=1>Interesting post</a> from a professional writer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not owed a read from a professional, even if you think you have an
in, and even if you think it's not a huge imposition. It's not your choice to
make. This needs to be clear--when you ask a professional for their take on
your material, you're not just asking them to take an hour or two out of their
life, you're asking them to give you--gratis--the acquired knowledge, insight,
and skill of years of work. It is no different than asking your friend the
house painter to paint your living room during his off hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the rules about inviting convention guests is that
you can't ask them to do whatever it is they do for a living for free.  It's
HORRIBLY impolite.  To use an extreme example: if we invited Weird Al as a
panelist, we couldn't ask him to sing.  He makes tens of thousands of dollars
for a concert, he worked years to achieve that, and no matter how much he
may LIKE us, giving us even a little filk session for free would undermine
that.  Similarly, if we invited a professional author (defined as "one who
makes their living by their income from writing"), we couldn't ask for a short
story for our program book.</p>

<p>I vaguely recall that when we asked our web cartoonists to do covers for
the program book, we bartered for it, giving them some advertising space
elsewhere.  (And we bought advertising on their website as well, so it was
part of a larger commercial transaction where they got paid cash.)</p>

<p>Lots of hobbyist conventions don't understand this.  Asking guests for
their time so they can be admired and entertained is one thing (and it's
entirely ok for them to say no simply because they don't want to, they
don't _need_ a reason).  Asking them to cheapen their professional services
is something else entirely.</p>

<p>While I was at Starbucks re-reading a Tamora Pierce book, I thought of a
solution to some of the FWL refactoring, and actually got enthused about
working on it again.  (For the first time in a month, not just vaguely poking
at it out of a sense of obligation but _wanting_ to work on it.)</p>

<p>Yay?</p>

<p>Got the uClibc build part reimplemented as a standalone script.  (Well,
kernel headers plus uClibc install.  The two go together, no point in
separating them.  I'll probably do binutils+gcc the same way.)</p>

<p>I've noticed that Lava Java on 26th plays Zombie Sinatra, and the
Thundercloud off of 15th plays a whole lotta Bob Dylan.  Of the two, Dylan
is a lot easier to listen to.  (Sinatra wasn't a very interesting singer.
Only reason I can think of him getting big gigs is "mob ties".  Then again,
I don't understand the "beat poet" craze of the 1950's, either.</p>

<p>And I attribute the continuing popularity of monotonic swearing (the C in
rap is silent) to a cultural identity good from an oppressed and alienated
minority youth demographic, and then a bunch of people romanticizing the
mindless violence it portrays just like they do with pirates and vikings,
none of whom you'd really want to <strike>meet</strike> smell in person.</p>

<p>I'm all for a good beat.  Lots of things from the Queen's "We will rock
you" to the Miami Vice theme to the Terminator II theme were pretty much just
drumbeats.  James Brown's career was built on nontraditional precussion,
which I'm also a big fan of.  (Drums are overused, and as good as "I need
a hero" is its use of a drum machine instead of a live drummer grates a bit
after a few re-listens.)  It can be done well, but just about all rap
isn't.</p>

<p>Every time I criticize [c]rap, I'm worried that if I'd been born 40
years earlier I'd have been one of those people criticizing Rock and Roll.
(Although I personally think Elvis is kind of boring too.  Beatles yay,
Momas and the Papas had some good bits, even the beach boys were accomplishing
something interesting.)</p>

<p>But I suppose Frank Sinatra made even Elvis sound outright enthralling.
(It's not like energetic music was _new_.  "The boogie woogie bugle boy of
company B" is from World War II.  They just replaced the small scale troubadors
with player pianos, and later phonographs, and scaled up the "big band" stuff
to the point where everybody thought you needed to 50 people to play an 
interesting song.</p>

<p>The toolchain build that cross-compiler.sh and root-filesystem.sh do
is close enough that I'm trying to split it out into a separate script I
can call from both of 'em.  But it's different enough that this is hard
to do.</p>

<p>For example, the uClibc "make utils" stuff is horrible.  (This is for ldd
and readelf and ldconfig.)  In the cross compiler case it's building a special
magic "hostutils" target so it knows "no, you're not to try to link these
suckers against the C library you just built, stupid", and then installing the
results with a shell loop involving sed to rename the suckers (because the
uClibc install for this is useless).  In the native case, it calls the make
twice in a loop because making the library and making the utils at the same
time isn't SMP safe (missing dependency somewhere I guess, I hate make).  And
then of course doing the utils install by hand, but in a different way.</p>

<p>Merging that together is ugly.  Another bit of ugliness is the aforementioned
"build uClibc before or after the toolchain" issue.  The cross compiler _must_
build it after the toolchain or else there's nothing to build it _with_.
The root filesystem would like to build it first so everything else links
against the shared library that's actually installed (for all we know our cross
toolchain is glibc based).  But there's still the problem of telling an
arbitrary toolchain to link against a specific C library, which is what the
wrapper script does because gcc is built _entirely_ out of unfounded assumptions
and overriding these assumptions from the gcc command line is possible but
horrible.</p>

<p>If I assume the arbitrary toolchain is gcc, it gets slightly easier,
but not by much.  I can build the C library, then build a host version of the
wrapper script, then run "gcc --print-file-name=libgcc.a" on the cross
compiler to find the gcc magic internal library directory (and use the
--print-file-name=include trick to find the compiler internal includes
directory), then drop symlinks to everything to set up a cross compiler
wrapper directory...  It _might_ work, but would need testing.  And of
course it would only work with gcc.</p>

<p>If our cross toolchain _isn't_ gcc... well, most likely the kernel and
uClibc won't build with it.  But assuming it's icc or some such, its static
library may not be called "libgcc.a", and there's no generic "libcc.a"
symlink the way there's libc.a pointing to glibc.  (Note that gcc was
personally maintained by Richard Stallman for longer than most other GNU
projects, and thus its design is insular bordering on xenophobic.  Dude
does not like the concept of interoperability, he wants one way migration
just like Microsoft.)</p>

<p>What's almost as ugly is that just about all builds are going to want a
shared library, but not all want a toolchain.  The forest of if statements
the current root-filesystem has is horrible.  I'm reluctant to break the
script into a bunch of little scripts (which I did for the
<a href=/code/firmware/old>previous iteration of FWL</a>, the pre-2006 one
that used uClibc instead of qemu and was thus x86 only), and it turned
into a forest of complexity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I want to call the same snippets in a different order,
having them in different files is pretty much the only way to go.  Right
now, it's easy to see what's happening in an entire build stage, it's
still pretty much one big shell script per stage.  There are setupfor and
cleanup functions, but those are mentally easy to gloss over as "extract
the tarball and cd into its directory" and "rm -rf the source we're not using
any more and check for errors".  (They do a bit more than that, but it's
more convenient than important.  Stuff to let multiple builds run in parallel,
create stage tarballs, automatically patch the source as it's extracted and
cache the extracted source so it doesn't need to be re-extracted,
and so on.)</p>

<p>I already have a top level build.sh wrapper that calls the other stages
in order, so the whole thing isn't one _big_ script.  I could turn those
scripts into wrappers that call the individual package build scripts in order,
assuming I can genericize 'em enough so things like the above uClibc build
differences can be turned into a couple environment variables you pass in
to tell it what to do.</p>

<p>What I want to _avoid_ is FWL turning into a mess like buildroot, where you
can stare at the build for an hour and still not have any idea what's going
on.  Admittedly, that's mostly because it's a series of nested makefiles,
which combines declarative dependencies with targets executing carefully
sequenced imperative code, and most people these days give up and call
makefiles recursively because they can't make this imperative/declaritive
mixture scale.  Also, buildroot made the mistake of turning into a
Linux distribution, building dozens and dozens of packages.</p>

<p>Right now, the FWL build scripts are close to a Linux From Scratch style
tutorial: reading them teaches you how to build a cross compiler, how
to cross compile a root filesystem, and how to package the result up into
a system image.  You only really _need_ to read three scripts to do this,
plus download.sh to get the list of source URLs.</p>

<p>I'm reluctant to mess with that, but as projects increase you've got
to split stuff into more modules.  Figuring out the appropriate granularity
is always tough, and shifts over time. :P</p>

<p>Arguing with the uClibc developers (mostly Bernhard).  In the most recent
release version, 0.9.30.1, you selected your architecture in menuconfig
using the "Target Architecture" menu.  I've been using uClibc for most of a
decade now, and that's always been the way you selected your target
architecture.  That menu is still there, it just no longer works, because

<p>Hey, and kmail continues to deteriorate.  I got 300+ identical spams
(as you do), so I did the sort by title thing, click the start of the range,
shift-click the end of the range, right click and move all to trash.  With
previous versions of kmail, this worked just fine.  This time, kmail locked
up for half an hour, rebuilding the indexes on every single mail folder I
have.  (It does this periodically, as a background process.  There's no way
to stop it that I've found.)  Unfortunately, the two processes interfered
with each other, and when it came back I found it had grabbed about 1500
random messages (scattered from 2005 to today) and threw them in the trash
too.  (Yes, I'm sure I didn't mis-select the range in my caffeine deprived
state.  As far as I can tell, there _is_ no ordering in which I could have
selected this particular swiss cheese arrangement.)</p>

<p>So kmail has random asynchronous cpu-eating background tasks (which you
can't tell it _not_ to do.  When it's been eating 100% of a CPU for more
than 15 minutes I generally just "killall kmail" twice and re-launch it).
Range selects are not safe to do while one of those is running, and not only
does it not clearly notify you when it's doing this (it updates the little
text bar at the bottom... after it's done), but it can choose to start doing
them _after_ you start a range select action.</p>

<p>Isn't that short bus special?  What a piece of garbage.</p>

<p>Well, Jonathan Corbet did do a <a href=http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/349970/eedfdfb7bd2b3a84/>write-up of the kernel thread</a>.
Unfortunately, he seems to have missed some of the subtleties in the
RAID case.</p>

<p>The problematic paragraph is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what if more than one drive fails? RAID works by combining blocks into larger stripes and associating checksums with those stripes. Updating a block requires rewriting the stripe containing it and the associated checksum block. So, if writing a block can cause the array to lose the entire stripe, we could see data loss much like that which can happen with a flash drive. As a normal rule, this kind of loss will not occur with a RAID array. But it can happen if (1) one drive has already failed, causing the array to run in "degraded" mode, and (2) a second failure occurs (Pavel pulls the power cord, say) while the write is happening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The "additional failure" isn't the same _kind_ of failure.  You don't
need an additional disk to fail, all you need is an unclean shutdown of
a degraded array, because "dirty plus degraded" means one or more groups
of stripes are probably unreadable and the data in them is lost.  That
means _any_ unclean shutdown with a degraded array that's being written to
can eat your data despite journaling, and NOT JUST THE DATA YOU WERE
UPDATING AT THE TIME.  If your kernel panics or hangs with
a degraded dirty RAID, you can lose random data from OTHER FILES,
in a way journaling won't even _detect_ let alone fix.</p>

<p>Starting a paragraph presumably talking about that issue with "But what
if more than one drive fails?" is extremely misleading.  The second failure
isn't an additional disk failure, it's an unclean shutdown while writing
to the disk (or having recently written to the disk, since the data is
buffered and could be written back at any time, and don't get me started
about atime updates).  That's a different issue.</p>

<p>Incidentally, my laptop paniced again last night, still running stock
Ubuntu 9.04 with updates from Ubuntu's updatey thing.  Probably a delayed
reaction to having unplugged and re-plugged my USB bluetooth dongle earlier
in the evening (the bluetooth stack really doesn't like controllers going away
between reboots), but that's just a guess since it paniced with X11 up and
all I got was a frozen display (including mouse pointer) and flashing
keyboard LEDs.</p>

<p>The point is: the kernel _does_ panic and hang.  That's why "watchdog"
and "heartbeat" systems exist.  If either of those triggers while a system
has a degraded software RAID, you can get silent random data loss in parts
of the filesystem that weren't recently updated.  All the arguments about
"use a UPS", "use ECC memory", "use dual power supplies with thermal
sensors", "don't use PC hardware"...  Side issue to that.</p>

<p>Here's another bad paragraph from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RAID arrays can increase data reliability, but an array which is not running with its full complement of working, populated drives has lost the redundancy which provides that reliability. If the consequences of a second failure would be too severe, one should avoid writing to arrays running in degraded mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is misleading because redundancy isn't what provides this reliability
in other contexts.  When you lose the redundancy, you open an _unrelated_
issue of update granularity.  A single disk doesn't have this "incomplete
writes can cause collateral damage to unrelated data" issue, nor does RAID 0
(which has no redundancy in the first place).  A degraded RAID 5 is _more_
vulnerable to data loss than RAID 0 is, which is not what people are taught
in most classes about this, and is a point lwn.net seems to have missed.</p>

<p>The fundamental issue is update granularity being bigger than the
filesystem expects, which is a _software_ issue, not the standard RAID 5
purpose of protecting against physical disk failures (which is a _hardware_
issue).</p>

<p>I <a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0909.0/00644.html>attempted to document this</a> already.  It'll probably be ignored.</p>

automatically re-extract and re-patch the uClibc source.</p>

<p>Alas, this got me to 4ae13b764d61fa9 which does:</p>

So I have to fix this.  Grr.  Once again, change what I'm bisecting for
halfway through a bisect, and hope I can keep it straight in my head despite
every cycle taking ten minutes between decision points without letting me
easily check back to look at previous commit/result pairs to see what I
was doing unless I write up notes for myself.  Wheee.  I do this for fun?</p>

<p>Time to play Sims 3 for a bit, I expect.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>So I tracked down the "impossible constraint" issue to uClibc git
b1913a8760599 which moves an #include of <unistd.h> and adds a symbol
defined in that.  Wheee.  (The one right before that, 0784fb9ef, worked
fine, at least with 5efcfdc5150 reverted.)  Presumably the fix will
be to unistd.h, which is a file uClibc proides.</p>

<p>I hate git.  I really hate git.</p>

<p>My wwwsend script does a
"git pull" on all the interesting repositories every time I sync my blog.
(It also backs up some directories to a server, rsyncs my mercurial repositories
to landley.net and impactlinux.com, and so on.  It would even update the
http://kernel.org/doc page if I'd done anything to that in months.</p>

<p>This means, the uClibc archive I've been playing with had a "git pull"
while I was in the middle of a "bisect".  So when I did a "git bisect reset",
it goes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 5 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's why I hate git: it never says how you do a fast forward.  I
mess with most software the way I used to play "zork".  I'd look for keywords
in the text I could type, and if that fails I make a couple obvious guesses
or go "git help" and see if that lists an interesting looking keyword.  This
approach works fine for mercurial, but for git it's useless.</p>

<p>Instead git has 8 gazillion man pages, without a clear list of what they
are.  (That's all the git help pages are, if you go "git help sodomy" it
says "No manual entry for gitsodomy".)  It's full of magic assumptions and
keywords that you're just supposed to _know_, some of which are listed in
859-line man page for the "git" command itself, but text searching that for
"fast-forward" didn't find a hit.</p>

<p>So the way to deal with this is to connect to the internet (which my laptop
is not always within arms length of) and use google.  In this case, the first
hit is <a href=http://cworth.org/hgbook-git/tour/>this</a> which has an
'On merges and "fast forward"' section near the end that helpful explains this
is something the merge command does.  I just did a git diff and there's no
local changes in my repsitory, and I've only pulled from one upstream.  What
the heck is there to _merge_?</p>

<p>The third google hit is the "git pull" man page, which shows the --no-ff
and --ff options.  Here's the help text for the --ff option:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not generate a merge commit if the merge resolved as a fast-forward, only update the branch pointer. This is the default behavior of git-merge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to "update the branch pointer" without actually A) generating a new
and utterly meaningless commit in the repository that makes my repository
differ from upstream, B) going out to the net and grabbing yet more changes
from the upstream server as a side effect.  Is there a way to do this?
I honestly have no clue, nor do I know where to start looking, nor do I
really care enough: it sounds like the next pull will fix this.</p>

<p>This is a piece of software where I have little or no control over what
it's doing, I'm just doing cargo cult programming at it in hopes that its
deep pool of black magic remains undisturbed and does not vomit forth
a cthulian behavioral problem.</p>

<p>I don't feel that way about Mercurial.  It's built on the same general
principles but I understand what it's doing and have even tweaked its
source code to get it to stop doing it at times.  The mercurial UI is
vaguely friendly, if a bit brusque in places.  The git UI is a crawling
horror requiring an extensive initiation before it will allow you access
to its secrets.  The two programs are doing approximately the same thing,
but which one's popular in the kernel community?  Three guesses...</p>

<p>Speaking of which, the interminable kernel thread I've been cc'd on
continues, but I think I've run out of willingness to read it anymore.  The
private emails are fun too, such as the guy who had the (and I quote):
"blatantly obvious realization that if you add an extra disk to gain safety
from redundancy, then losing a disk eliminates the safety which that redundancy
provides."</p>

<p>To which my reply was:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Except the safety you're losing didn't come from that redundancy, since 
journaling works just fine on a single disk.

RAID protects you from the physical failure of a single disk.  Journaling 
protects you from system failures leaving the disk in an inconsistent state 
requiring an fsck before you can safely write to them again without 
overwriting or leaking allocated storage space for data.  This failure mode is 
neither, it's a write granularity issue overwriting data in seemingly 
unrelated storage space which a write transaction was not recently addressed 
to.

Interesting thread.  On one side are people insisting it's user error for not 
having a deep enough understanding of how the implementation details of 
particular storage devices are leaking through the "block device" abstraction.  
On the other are people offering "blantantly obious" analogies that only make 
any sense if you have no clue what's actually going on.  And both sides are 
arguing that this is why it _doesn't_ need to be documented.

<p>Spent most of the evening bisecting why uClibc doesn't build.  Bisecting
finds more than one bug, of course.  Narrowed down the build break introduced
by uClibc-git 5efcfdc5150 which sprinkles attribute_noreturn in a lot of
places that (in my .config at least) it's never #defined in the headers.</p>

<p>There are actually several different things I should track down.  I'm
using a <a href=http://impactlinux.com/hg/firmware/file/0f9c421d8504/sources/patches/uClibc-install2.patch>patch</a>
to prevent uClibc from throwing pointless absolute paths into its linker
scripts (thus preventing a toolchain using it from being relocatable, by
which I mean installed at an arbitrary location such as a user's home
directory without being recompiled from source).  I submitted that patch
upstream to the uClibc guys but got sufficient pushback (along the lines
of gcc's --sysroot option can work around this in a very clumsy way and
we all use that, even though what this does is _remove_ unnecessary code)
that I thought it wasn't going to be merged.  Nevertheless, somewhere between
uClibc-git c54be380406 and 9889c8791b5 the problem got fixed upstream, and I
should bisect to see where and see what changed.  (This is another example of
"good" and "bad" being reversed in a bisect.  The "good" fails and the "bad"
succeeds.  What they really mean is "before" and "after" the patch I'm looking
for.)</p>

<p>But meanwhile, I should track down the "everything is x86-64" I posted
about yesterday, because the bug I just tracked down was not that bug,
merely a bug preventing me from _finding_ that bug.</p>

<p>Mark and I currently have the following talks prepared, so it'll probably
be one of these:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Cross Compiling:
  - Why it sucks, how to do it anyway, and alternatives (see QEMU panel).
  - Toolchain weirdness: Host vs target (vs build), canadian cross, leaks.
  - Lying to configure, pitfalls for the unwary, pitfalls for the wary.

Building embedded system images with uClibc and BusyBox
  - What Linux From Scratch doesn't tell you.
  - Smallest near-posix shell prompt is linux, busybox, uClibc.
  - Add gcc, binutils, make, and bash and you have a self-bootstrapping system.

Developing for non-x86 targets using QEMU.
  - Emulation allows even casual hobbyist developers to build and test their
    software on multiple hardware platforms from the comfort of their laptop.
  - QEMU is rapidly becoming a category killer in open source emulation
    software, capable of not only booting a knoppix CD in a window but booting
    arm, mips, powerpc, sparc, sh4, and more.
  - This panel covers application vs system emulation, native vs cross
    compiling (and combining the two with distcc), using qemu, setting up an
    emulated development environment, real world scalability issues, using the
    amazon cloud or building your own monster server for under $3k.

A survey of embedded build systems.
  - buildroot, openwrt, open embedded, gentoo embedded, Fedora for Arm,
    emdebian, openmoko, scratchbox...
  - Orthogonality, reinventing the wheel, accidental distros.

Firmware Linux and Gentoo From Scratch
  - The creators of two embedded Linux build systems explain their design
    choices.  What they are, how to use them, and why we did them that way.

From idea to device
  - What's involved in actually installing and running your software on a
    standalone piece of hardware?  Choosing a processor and development board,
    toolchain, kernel, root filesystem, jtag, bootloader, emulator, debugger
    UI issues for a headless box, the Hello World problem.

<p>Current uClibc-git dies trying to build for an i686 target with:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yup, that's x86-64 assembly out of the x86_64 directory, when the
.configure says it's an i686 target.  It's autodetecting what host I'm
building on, and building for that despite what I told it.  (Note that
this is the exact same build script that cross compiled the last release
version just fine.)</p>

<p>And it does it when building for armv4l too.  Fired up menuconfig
and confirmed it's got "arm" selected as the target...</p>

<p>It's official, even the uClibc developers can't keep host and target
straight.  Cross compiling _sucks_.  And now I have to go bisect this
to see when it was introduced and if maybe if they have some new redundant
way to specify the target a _third_ way.  (They've got .config, they've
got the toolchain #defines, but that's not _enough_.  Although it was
for 0.9.30.1.)</p>

<p>Visited Mark's, we worked out that the instructional videos should probably
be audio with either slides or screen caputre.  (Coincidentally, MacOSX 10.6
came out today, and has the ability to make screen capture videos built in
to the new OS release.  Convenient, that.  SSH to a Linux box and type
thingies live, while recording audio.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out why current busybox breaks the binutils
build.  The large range of build breaks doesn't help with this, my first
bisection attempt insisted that the breakage was in a range of 8 commits
I'd skipped all of because they didn't build.  So I tweaked the trimconfig
to remove the dhcp server and client, which seem to be what's breaking.
(Ok, disable hdparm too.  And mkfs.vfat...)</p>

<p>Ok, it's busybox commit 09e63bb81f127 that broke, which claims to be an
attempt to fix "df /" by hardwiring in a string compare for the word "rootfs",
rather than handling the general overmount case which my toybox df
implementation was doing back in 2007.  So the patch itself is the wrong
approach to the problem it tries to fix, and contains lots of totally
unrelated code that has nothing to do with its stated goal which is
probably what's breaking my build. (Since tar timestamps are what's getting
screwed up, fiddling with df ain't gonna screw that up.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it looks like I need to push my toybox implementation of df
into busybox...  Sigh.  Dowanna.  Not fun anymore.</p>

<p>Deal with it in the morning.</p>

<a name="27-08-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#27-08-2009">August 27, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Fade spent today in class and I did _not_ play Sims 3 on her computer!
(This is an _accomplishment_.  I am PROUD!)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>I got sucked into a Linux-kernel mailing list discussion again.  (In my
defense, I was cc'd.)  It's about documentation of a fairly nasty bug,
and it's reminded me of why I don't hang out on lkml anymore.</p>

<p>The bug is an assumption in most standard Linux filesystems (including ext2
and ext3).  They all assume that the update granularity of the underlying block
device they're writing to is greater than or equal to the filesystem's
granularity.  (I.E. that the smallest write you can do to the block device is
the same size or smaller than a filesystem block.)  Oh, and also that the
algnment works out, so that data you're not writing doesn't get destroyed
as "collateral damage" by a failed write operation.</p>

<p>This isn't true for flash, which has "erase blocks" up to a couple megabytes
each.  As with burnable cd-roms, you have to do an "erase" pass on an area
of flash memory before it can have new data written to it.  You can't erase
just _part_ of an erase block, it's all or nothing.</p>

<p>Actual Linux flash filesystems (like jffs2) are aware of this.  That's why
you can't mount them on an arbitrary block device, you have to feed them actual
raw flash memory hardware (or something that emulates it) so they can query
extra information (erase block boundaries).  They cycle through the erase
blocks and keep one blank at all times, copying the old data to the blank
one before making the old one the new blank one.  (That's why mounting them is
so slow, the filesystem has to read all the flash erase blocks to figure out
which one's newest, and which order to put them in.)</p>

<p>But flash USB keys pretend to be normal USB hard drives, which you format
FAT, or ext3 or some such.  And when you write to them, what they're actually
doing internally is reading a megabyte or so of data into internal memory,
erasing that block of data, and then re-writing it with your modifications.
Generally they'll cache some writes first so they're not rewriting a
whole megabyte of flash every time you send another 512 byte sector (which
would not only be insanely slow but would run through the limited number
of flash write cycles pretty quickly).</p>

<p>This sounds fine... until you unplug one during a write and the device
loses power between the internal "erase" and "rewrite".  Suddenly,
the sector you were writing to might be ground zero in the middle of a
megabyte of zeroes.  You can lose data before, after, or on both sides
of the sector it was updating.</p>

<p>Journaling doesn't pretect you from this, because it was built on the
assumption that data you weren't writing to didn't change.  The "collateral
damage" effect of flash erase blocks undermines what journaling is trying to
do, by violating the design assumptions of conventional Linux filesystems.
In fact if the journal isn't what got zeroed, the journal replay may complete
happily and mount the filesystem and hide the fact anything went wrong...
until you try to use the missing data, anyway.  (Not that using
a non-journaled filesystem would actually _improve_ matters, but it's
less likely to give you a false sense of security.)</p>

<p>For further reading, see Linux filesystems expert Valerie Aurora's excellent
post on why she personally
<a href=http://valhenson.livejournal.com/25228.html>doesn't want
a flash disk in her laptop</a>.</p>

<p>So a Linux developer named Pavel Machek tried to document this months
ago, which is where I first heard about it.  (It explained some failures
the Neuros guys were seeing at the time, so I passed the info on.)  The
response from the kernel community was "USB flash disks that pretend to be
hard drives are crap, don't use 'em."</p>

<p>A couple days ago Pavel
came back because he found a _second_ case where the "update size <= filesystem
block size" problem could cause data loss: degraded software raid 5.  When
a RAID 5 looses a disk, it reconstructs the missing data via parity checking,
based on the "stripe size".  According to <a href=http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO-5.html>this howto</a>,
a reasonable stripe size for raid 5 is 128k, times the number of disks
in the raid (minus one) gives you the chunk size.  So a 5 disk raid would
give an update granularity of 512k.</p>

<p>Back to degraded raid: when it loses a disk it can read all the matched
stripes and compare them to reconstruct the information, but it needs the
relevant stripes from all the remaining disks to do this.  It can't read
just some of the stripes and get anything useful.  Meaning when you're writing
to it, if you write some of the stripes but not others (because the power
failed, the kernel paniced or hung, a watchdog timer rebooted your machine,
a load balancer killed the xen instance running your node...) you not only
lost the data you were writing, you lost some or all of the data in the
matched stripes.  Collateral damage again, because the update granularity
was bigger than the sector size.</p>

<p>This is more or less a second manifestation of the same problem.  There's
an assumption at the core of most Linux filesystems that's not necessarily
true on modern hardware.  (And as hardware gets bigger, the update
granularity is likely to get coarser.)  Once I've seen a problem twice, I
expect to see it a third time, so I've been hoping this gets documented
and possibly even addressed in new filesystems like btrfs (although
how exactly to do that is an open question).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the linux-kernel developer trend for the past few years
is "if it doesn't hit big iron, we don't care".  Developers keep bringing up
the Google cluster, cloud storage, invoking full-time trained system
administrators magically knowing all this already, insisting that nobody
should ever use software raid when battery backed up RAID
cards exist, and generally ignoring the existence of individual users, small
businesses with less than 30 empoyees, embedded developers, and so on.
So we
<a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0908.3/02034.html>talk past each other a lot</a>.</p>

<p>(Not that I can really argue with the assertion that adding a mention of
this to the kernel Documentation directory would be useless because
<a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0908.3/01829.html>nobody
actually reads the kernel Documentation directory</a>.)</p>

<p>Given the funding profile of Red Hat these days, the big iron tropism isn't
really surprising, but it is discouraging.  (The need for IBM's big iron
systems to enumerate zillions of devices is the reason transport type is
more or less hidden by the scsi layer.  The fact your laptop has exactly
one SATA drive and you haven't _got_ a device enumeration problem finding
your root filesystem doesn't help IBM, therefore the kernel developers
employed to solve big iron problems went to great efforts to make this
_everybody's_ problem until either it was fixed for IBM or until
nobody was using Linux on laptops anymore.  Both seem to have occurred.
Back in 2006 when I first put mdev into busybox, I was really annoyed about
this.)</p>

<p>Of _course_ there's politics involved in what used to be primarily
technical discussions.  The fact that the guy who started this conversation,
Pavel Machek, has apparently been
<a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/348043/>Making a huge neusance of himself
on other mailing lists</a> came as a bit of a surprise to me.  It doesn't
change my position in the debate, but does undermine it significantly.
Oh well.</p>

<p>This is why I don't hang out there anymore.  The signal/noise ratio is
still reasonable, but the signal/pain ratio buries the needle.  I
don't _want_ to have to care about any of this.  (I'm not particularly
happy about needing to know it in the first place, I don't _want_ it to
be my problem.)  I've written and
then _deleted_ about as many messages as I've actually posted.
(I <a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0908.3/01694.html>try to be polite</a>,
sometimes <a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0908.3/01699.html>very hard</a>,
but <a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0908.3/01678.html>the snark comes out eventually</a>.)</p>

<p>Hopefully, this can become <a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0908.3/00347.html>somebody else's problem</a> and I can go back
to happily ignoring lkml until they break something I care about again
(I.E. the next quarterly release, like clockwork).</p>

<p>Fade's classes started yesterday.  Today, we did 8 gazillion errands.</p>

<p>The most expensive was that we bought yet another printer, because the
Epson CX8400 we had turns out to need its color cartridges replaced when
you buy new black ink for it, even when it wasn't complaining about them
_before_ I put a new black ink cartridge in, and now it's complaining about
all three.  (We've printed basically nothing in color so far.)</p>

<p>Called Epsion tech support and the nice lady in India confirmed this is
Broken As Designed (not _quite_ in so many words), and since this is too evil
money grubbing bastard weasely for me to ever want to give money to Epson ever
again in my _life_, and Fade needs a printer for class, we hit Fry's
and bought a laser printer.  It just does black and white, but even the
cheesy "substandard free ink cartridge that comes with it" prints 1000 sheets.
And a new ink cartridge is $50 and prints 3000 sheets.  We should come out
ahead in about two semesters.</p>

<p>I'd mention Mark, but apparently his relatives have
found my blog and are using it to indirectly keep tabs on him.  (I keep
forgetting that people other than me read this.  I also keep forgetting to
update it.  I'm spending a lot more time on

<p>Went with the delay.  It's not a _good_ solution, but it's reliable and
doesn't require tearing out huge amounts of infrastructure or making unportable
assumptions about the host environment.</p>

<p>Also, I have to drop a timestamp file into the snapshotted source directory.
I can't use the time of the directory because anything getting written into
that directory (which not only the make can do but the install as well)
updates that, because the directory is essentially a file of dentry records,
and thus when one of the dentries changes the timestamp for when the directory
was last modified gets updated.  (In theory I could try to compare creation
times instead of modification times, but find doesn't give me that kind of
control.)</p>

<p>And of course I had to fix yet another instance of bash doing:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
while [ $THING == "$(thingy)" ]
do
  blah blah blah
done
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Because apparently $(thingy) is evaluated once and never again.  But if
you change it to:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
while true
do
  [ $THING != "$(thingy)" ] && break
  blah blah blah

<p>Yes, this is the current bash in Ubuntu 9.04 that still has this bug.
That's also the version with
the bug where the current headphone volume when you suspend your laptop becomes
the maximum volume when you resume your laptop, with the slider moving smoothly
between those values.  (And of course I feel nervous having the volume 100%
up on my headphones because if it _does_ suddenly reset itself to sane
behavior, my ears will ring for some time.  Also, if I unplug the headphones
the _speakers_ are really loud, but plugging the headphones back in it's
really quiet again.  Yes, I've made sure the little volume knob on the
headphones themselves are all the way up, that's not it.  It's that the sound
driver has independent controls for the volume of the speaker and headphone
output channels, but the Linux volume control tools are presenting they're
the same thing, even though it let them get out of sync.)</p>

<p>And it's the same version of Ubuntu where kmail and firefox both regularly
hang for 30 seconds at a time, refusing to even repaint until they've finished
whatever strange internal thumb-twiddling they're doing.  (I'm told firefox
is garbage collecting.  Any garbage collector that takes 30 seconds to run
is broken.  I have no idea what kmail is doing, it's had the CPU pegged
for about 4 hours now.  Even when it is responding to me, it's busy doing
_something_ in the background.  Badly.)</p>

<p>I've stopped even trying to complain about what they did to vi...</p>

<p>Linux on the desktop: smell the usability.</p>

<p>Gave up and did a "killall kmail" (you have to do it twice, the first
one gets caught up in the endless wait), and re-launch it.  Then it's
responsive again.  For a while...</p>

<p>So I'm poking at toybox again, because the "touch" command in toybox does
a lot more than the "touch" command in busybox, and at this point it's
easier to add -R and -d to toybox touch than to busybox touch.</p>

<p>I'm also looking at the principles behind the program and still happier
with its infrastructure than I am with busybox's.  I like having a help
command, so you go "./toybox help touch" instead of busybox's strange
mixture of "./busybox --help touch" and "./busybox touch --help".  The
"help" command is the bash builtin to tell you about shell builtin commands,
it's a bit like man except it doesn't look for data files on the filesystem.
I may eventually add some variant of man behavior to toybox (not troff based,
though) and have it fall back to help for stuff it can't find.  Dunno.</p>

<p>I think I need to write up fresh infrastructure documentation.  It's not
a big program, and I've still got the old <a href=http://landley.net/code/toybox/design.html>design</a>
and <a href=http://landley.net/code/toybox/code.html>implementation</a>
docs.  But I need to write up a series of explanations about what problems
I was solving and why I did it that way, because I keep hitting things
in busybox that still do it wrong, which I assumed were fixed because _I_
fixed it.  (Yes, "tar cvjfC filename directory" is still broken in busybox.)</p>

<p>If I picked toybox back up and made it my main full-time project, I could
do a better job than what's out there.  If I picked my tinycc fork back up and
made it my main full-time project, I could do a _far_ better job than what's
out there.  Right now FWL is my main programming hobby project but it's just a
hobby I poke at as the mood strikes me, and if I really buckled down I could
be doing nightly tests of uClibc, busybox, Linux, and qemu on each target
QEMU supports...  Which would probably bring in a full time supply of bugs
to diagnose and fix ad nauseum...</p>

<p>I've been taking notes on the health care thing, and it's to the point
where I'm writing up a rant on it just to get it straight in my own head.</p>

<p>Obvious things, like: You're aware Bill O'Reilley and Rush Limbaugh and
Glenn Beck and such are _actors_, right?  Alan Alda can't perform surgery
despite years on MASH any more than Johnny Depp is actually a caribbean
pirate.  These people are entertainers, who know perhaps as much about the
functioning of government as Johnny Carson did when he joked about it in
his nightly monologue.  The difference is that Johnny didn't pretend _his_
opinions carried special weight, even when millions of people were
listening.</p>

<p>Or noting that social security doesn't prevent you from having an additional
retirement plan on top of that, (in fact the Roth IRA is even tax free,) so
why would you expect social health care to eliminate the ability to buy
private health insurance on top of it?  (Or simply the ability to cough up
your own money for extra attention from the medical profession, such as botox
and liposuction.) If you stop and think about it, it's a really stupid
assumption.  Fundamentally, we're talking about extending medicare to cover
everybody.  Lots of people have insurance on _top_ of medicare.</p>

<p>(And yes, there is
<a href=http://www.insurance-canada.ca/consinfohealth/healthwhy.php>private health insurance in canada</a> as
anybody who bothered to type that phrase into google would quickly discover.
Admittedly the debate here in the US is quickly poisoning Google's
searches, but anybody with half-decent google-fu can throw the word
"buy" on the front and similar tricks to filter out blow-hards recycling
unsubstantiated opinions.)</p>

<p>The "Death Panel" idiots particularly annoy me.  Today the feds provide
health care to inmates on death row, and they've done so for decades.  These
are people the system is <b>actively trying to kill</b>, but they keep them
healthy until then.  If you think they'll do worse for you, you're NOT
THINKING.</p>

<p>This isn't a "difference of opinion", this is one side explicitly _lying_
for political purposes, which is called "propoganda" (a textbook example of
the phenomenon).  A lot of people are believing stupid things that don't
survive thirty seconds rational thought, because they _want_ to believe
them.  You think Limbaugh's going to go "I want Obama to fail, but this health
care thing actually seems kind of reasonable because reality isn't black and
white"?  Barney Frank's Godwin smackdown about "arguing with a dining room
table" seems fairly accurate.</p>

<p>I'll stop before I type up the whole rant _here_.  It's like the SCO
lawsuit all over again...</p>
</span>

<span id=programming>
<p>Right, computer programming:</p>

<p>Today's design decision: when FWL snapshots a source tarball, should
the snapshot be named alt-$PACKAGE or just $PACKAGE?  The source it's
snapshotting is alt-$PACKAGE, but the cleanup function would be simpler
if the name was consistent.  (Or if the value of $PACKAGE had the
alt- prefix as necessary.)</p>

<p>I've done most of the refactoring necessary to create individual source
tarballs.  I haven't taken more than a quick glance at unifying the
toolchain building code of cross-compiler.sh and root-filesystem.sh,
because the "build uClibc first vs build uClibc near the end" issue
remains outstanding.  I should grab a toolchain from buildroot or something
and see what it would take to get root-filesystem.sh to build with that...</p>

<p>Heh.  Fun little note about that "find $STAGE_DIR -newer $CURSRC"
thing: for packages like toybox that can configure, build, and start the
install in under a second, the find may not actually find anything on a
filesystem that hasn't got nanosecond granularity.  Oops.</p>

<p>Given that I can't require the host to support nanosecond timestamps,
potential obvious fix #1 is to throw in a one second wait, which I
really don't want to do.  (Seems counterproductive to de-optimize the build
like that.)  Potential obvious fix #2 is to do a touch -R on the source
directory to reset its datestamp comfortably into the past, except there's
nothing safe I can set it to because there's no guarantee it's been a full
second since the previous build finished installing files yet.  Potential
obvious fix #3 is to do a touch -R on the output directory to set all _its_
files one second into the past, which doesn't work because busybox touch
doesn't support -R or -d.</p>

<p>I think that's where I call it a night.  I have all the infrastructure
in place except for the little detail that it doesn't actually _work_.
But I know why, which is something.</p>

<p>Finally saw "taken", the last movie left over from the "Fade doesn't care
to see this" pile during her trip to Seattle.  A decent semi-brainless
action flick.  Not particularly memorable, but kind of refreshing to see a
good actor play a protagonist going on an actual, reasonably justified,
unapologetically homicidal rampage for pretty much the entire movie.</p>
</span>

<span id=programming>
<p>By the time I managed to get the first pass cross compiler to generate and
install libgcc_eh.a properly, it was an anticlimax.  Still, finished it,
tweaked the wrapper to use it, and checked it in anyway.</p>

<p>This opens the possibility of having one compiler building script,
maybe even having root-filesystem.sh call cross-compiler.sh for that
part of the build.  In addition to beating enough granularity out of the
build to perform a working canadian cross (now done in root-filesystem.sh),
the big difference was the --disable-shared vs --enable-shared thing, which
meant one could build uClibc++ (which needed libgcc_eh.a) and the other
couldn't.</p>

<p>Removing code duplication is always appealing...</p>

<p>First I should teach setupfor/cleanup to make tarballs of installed
binaries, but unfortunately if you write a file into a directory it modifies
the timestamp on the directory itself, meaning a naieve attempt to do this
passes the whole directory as an argument to tar and everything's included.
I need to filter out non-leaf directories, which turns out to be
nontrivial.</p>

<p>I can use something like "find build/host -newer build/host-temp/squashfs
-not -type d", and even though busybox find doesn't mention -not in its
--help, it honors it.  But then to add the sufficiently new leaf node
directories (which some packages require) I'd need to do something like
"find build/host -newer build/host-temp/squashfs -type d -empty", and
busybox find doesn't support -empty.</p>

<p>Hmmm, the -depth option means find does a depth first search, meaning I
can check each line to see if the previous line starts with that plus
a slash, meaning this is a non-leaf directory and I should dump it.
Except sed hasn't got any obvious way to compare the pattern space with the
hold space, or substitute the hold space into an s/// comparison.  Hmmm,
it's got the "empty regex" thing that caches the previous search and repeats
it, maybe I can do something with that?  No, because I can't get the input
data into the search and make it what I'm checking for, not without
synthesizing a sed command line in bash.  (There's probably a way to do
this in awk, but I dunno what it is.  It would be trivial to do in Python,
of course.  Or C.)</p>

<p>Sigh, I'm probably going to have to do it in shell, which makes
string handling unnecessarily unpleasant.  (Especially anything with
whitespace in it.)  For example, according to SUSv4's shell documentation,
${varname##pattern} shuld almomst do what I want... except that
${varname##$PATTERN} expands $PATTERN and then treats any * or ? or [] in it
as special characters...  Ah, I need quotes, ala "${varname##"$PATTERN"/}".</p>

<p>Of course even outputting the result is nontrivial, because if you have
a top level file named "-n" or "-e" or "-x", then going:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>echo "$FILENAME"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Produces no output, because the quotes get stripped before echo evaluates
its arguments.  The standard extension to disable command option parsing is
--, but echo -- "$FILENAME" treats the double dash as a literal and outputs
it.  (Yes, both the gnu and busybox versions, and the bash builtin.)  Of
course I could work around this problem with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>echo "x$FILENAME" | cut -b 1-</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is only slightly ridiculous.  (My first guess was
"sed 's/^x\(.*\)/\1/'", which was highly riciulous.)</p>

<p>Yes, shell programming is an area where Linux is every bit as crazy,
brittle, and insecure as the Windows API.  And you wonder why I've put so
much effort into making sure the FWL build does not need to run as root?  Just
being _aware_ of all these edge cases is a challenge.  (And yes, I'm
intentionally ignoring embedded newlines in files, which the -print0 stuff
is for, which isn't remotely universally supported either..)</p>

<p>Brown paper bag bug.  Oops.  My fault, of course.  My testing of <a href=http://impactlinux.com/hg/firmware/rev/803>hg 803</a>
didn't actually exercise the changed bit.  As I posted to the list:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that neither HOST_BUILD_EXTRA nor ./download.sh --extract actually 
work in yesterday's release is a bit of a brown paper bag bug.  Oops.  Sorry 
about that.</p>

<p>Strangely, buildall.sh doesn't hit this because the current version doesn't 
./download.sh --extract anymore, but instead relies on building the host arch 
first to extract all the packages the other targets need.  (And if you haven't 
set HOST_BUILD_EXTRA, it'll never try to extract qemu, which is what
breaks.)</p>

<p>The big evil regex in the shell function "noversion", which tries to strip
the  version number off of the package name, is what's going wrong.  Its idea
of "version" must start with a dash, and then only accepts a letter immediately 
following a digit (ala bash-2.05b), so the name "qemu-2d18e637e5ec.tar.bz2" 
(which is the package name qemu, a dash, and then a git commit id) doesn't 
work because it has two consecutive letters at the end.  If I strip off the 
"c", it works.  (Cut it in the wrong place and never noticed.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could cut another release right now over this bug, but it's not exactly
a show-stopper if buildall.sh doesn't hit it.  It's far more _embarassing_
than it is serious.  I note that if this release hadn't been delayed, then the
next release would be at the start of October a little over a month from now,
so I'm leaning towards having the next release then.  (But if anybody really
objects in the next day or two, I can re-think that.)</p>

<p>Fade's birthday.  She already bought herself an iPhone, and nothing I
get her could top that, so I cleaned the house a bit instead, got her up
early (9 am, ooooh), we went for kolaches (with coupon!), hit the

<p>Poking at the release notes.  Wow this is a big fiddly update.  No
real way to coherently summarize it, I did a _lot_.</p>

<p>Those podcasts mark and I want to do should just be "how to use FWL",
because although it's easy to say "download the source, run ./build.sh to
see the list of targets, and then run "./build.sh targetname" on the one you
like" is simple enough, actually understanding everything it can do and why
probably takes hours to explain.</p>

<p>Fade bought an iPhone.  I need to go to the t-mobile store and update
my phone plan so her line isn't on it anymore.  (Yes, the t-mobile guys
asked me _six_times_ whether or not I'd seen the new google phone.  Not
the g-1, the new "mycroft" or whatever it is.  They still don't understand

<p>Then again, I haven't exactly been going at it guns blazing this past month,
have I?  I will never voluntarily write GPLv3 software, but I'm willing to
be paid to write proprietary code.  (Haven't decided yet if being paid to
write GPLv3 code would be worse or the same as proprietary.  Proprietary is
at least _honest_ about its intentions.)</p>

<p>It was nice when I could be paid to
write GPLv2 code, but the FSF put an end to that by releasing GPLv3.  I'm
not the only developer who lost enthusiasm after that.</p>

<p>The Open Source developers' policy towards Richard Stallman is similar to
the United States policy towards Fidel Castro: isolate as much as possible,
monitor crazy man's beard length from afar and wait for him to die of old age,
then clean up afterwards.  Unfortunately, while Castro no longer has Nukes
RMS still exerts influence over things like Samba, QT, and GCC and can
make them re-license with anti-tivoization and anti-application service
provider provisions that pretty much render the code unusable even to
hobbyists like me.  Sad.</p>

<p>Vaguely suspecting I should have gone to Armadillocon.  It sounds like

<p>The bisection continues, or would if I understood where I left off last
night.  I must have been _really_ sleep deprived, because when I woke up this
<strike>morning</strike> afternoon I'd forgotten that in order to get 696 to
build armv4eb you need to either patch or upgrade busybox, and then to get a
usable qemu invocation to run it you need to fix the typo ala commit 734.
I vaguely recall my tests were all forcing it to busybox 1.14.3 (the current
version) and zapping local patches, and then I had a qemu invocation in the
other window that I cursor-up ran, but now I can't seem to reproduce it.
Even 696 isn't finding its hard drive, which is weird.</p>

<p>On the other hand, armv4eb wasn't in the last release, so it's not
a regression for this release if it doesn't work.  Except I thought I _had_
made it work last night, and I'm not seeing how, which is awkward...</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>As I posted to the FWL list yesterday, the only actual regression left
from last release is that armv4eb doesn't work.  It builds, and boots
through the kernel message, but fails to execute even a hell-static init.
The odd part is that hello-static runs just fine from qemu's application
emulation, so something's funky here.</p>

<p>Of course there's new versions of the compiler, the kernel, and qemu
to deal with here.  The symptoms don't point to qemu, and I don't _think_
they quite point to the compiler either.  (It's building a kernel qemu
system emulation can run, and a userspace program that qemu application
emulation can run.)  The obvious thing to look at (uClibc) didn't change.
I don't remember if last release was using squashfs by default yet, so
it's possible that's the culprit as well.</p>

<p>For the moment, I've snapshotted a fresh copy of the build scripts and
rolled it back to commit 748 which is right before the new compiler went
in, to make sure it _did_ used to work and I'm not imagining things or
remembering based on something that never properly got checked in.  When
faced with this many variables, the easy way to track it down is to focus
on what actually changed since the last time it worked, find the change
that broke it, and then figure out why...</p>

<span id=entertainment>
<p>Meanwhile, I've had the "Bruce Almighty" DVD (via Netflix) in my laptop
for a week.  It's here because while Fade was in Seattle I queued up some
DVDs she didn't want to watch, and a week after she came back I'm finally
forcing myself to watch it so I can return it.</p>

<p>I liked The Mask, The Truman Show, and found Liar Liar entertaining (if
not rewatchable).  And unlike those, this one did well enough to spawn a
sequel.  So I feel I should give it a chance.</p>

<p>The reason I never even considered seeing it in theatres is it seemed like
the kind of movie I'd want to pause every few minutes to recover my interest
in watching.  True to my expectations, the movie spent the first 20 minutes
torturing the protagonist.  (Dull, mundane tortures that were uncomfortable
to watch without actually being entertaining.)</p>

<p>It got much more interesting when Morgan Freeman showed up.  (George
Burns and Alanis Morisette also had great turns as the judeo-christian God.
It must be an interesting part to have on your resume.  I mostly think of
it as playing Zeus in Clash of the Titans)  Alas, then Jim
Carrey's character had a somewhat predictable "bad behavior" montage, albeit
this time at least with mildly interesting special effect.</p>

<p>And now he's torturing another of his pre-power nemeses.  (Nemesises?
Nemesi?  Oh all right, ctrl-alt-google: Nemeses or (rare) nemesi.
Yes, I'm blogging about this rather than watching the movie.  I've
never found the <a href=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga>Humiliation Conga</a> school of comedy funny, and yes I just linked
to <a href=http://xkcd.com/609/>tvtropes</a>, so don't click on that if
you value the rest of your day.)  The people who wrote this movie obviously
think watching bad things happen to people who don't necessarily deserve it
is hilarious and I find it painful.  (Weird Al pulled off a humiliation conga
at the end of UHF that was funny, but it was so over the top you couldn't
take it seriously and he spent the whole movie setting up a cartoonish
villain who deserved it...)</p>

<p>So far the movie has been one long excuse for Carrey to mug, and unlike
The Mask it isn't actually improved by this.  He kept it out of the way in
The Truman Show as well.  There's a lot of effort going into _trying_ to be
funny, without ever being surprising.  (Again, I've even seen _that_ done
well elsewhere.  To me the funniest line in Monty Python's "The Life of
Brian" is "he has a wife, you know", the entire _point_ of which is to
telegraph what's coming.  But that scene's all about building and
drawing out comedic tension, the actual individual jokes are almost
irrelevant, just excuses for the masterful timing and delivery.  The
Pythons played each scene like a musical instrument, but this movie's all
"insert joke here" paint by numbers crud.  It not only never builds, it
would never occur to them _to_ build.  Nothing's connected.)</p>

<p>I'm down to pausing the movie every 30 seconds and trying to figure out
why it's ticking me off in a way "Liar Liar" specifically didn't.  Perhaps
because a lawyer protagonist is expected to be unsympathetic, so when he
did something that annoyed me it worked with rather than against what the
movie was trying to achieve at that point?</p>

<p>No, the main problem is that Carrey's character in the previous movies may
have been annoying at times, flawed, shallow, but he wasn't STUPID.  In The
Truman Show, he had to detect, investigate, and then outthink a massive
conspiracy.  In The Mask he made extremely creative use of the powerful
but limited supernatural element at his disposal.  In Liar Liar he may
have been a slimy lawyer but he was smart, trying to work around his
problems and solving his final case around his handicap.  But Bruce in this
movie is a short-sighted self-centered idiot, a victim of circumstance
given unlimited power out of the blue, and making plodding, pedestrian use
of it with obvious (predictably bad) consequences.</p>

<p>It's not fun to watch a guy repeatedly step on land mines the audience
spots ten or fifteen seconds before he does.  (Ooh, and now he gets to
commit adultery while his girlfriend walks in on them!  Yup, she did.
Yes I typed the first of those before she had, no the movie didn't make me
wait long.)</p>

<p>It's bad enough watching incredibly predictable moves with
predictable consequences backed up by fairly pedestrian CGI.  (It's hard
enough to do romance at the best of times, but here I don't have a clue
what she ever saw in him in the first place.)  But the people making the
movie obviously keep thinking something about this is funny, and that's
making it worse somehow.  This movie is constructed out of cliches,
starting with "be careful what you wish for", but it's not even plumbing
the intellectual depths of Spider-Man's "with great power comes great
responsibility".  I've seen these cliches done better!</p>

<p>Ooh, rioting in the streets finally got his attention.  Hey, he
finally teleported.  (Yes, he had omnipotence and commuted to work
by car all this time.  That's less disturbing to me than the fact he worked
a day job, which is less disturbing than the fact he spent about half the
movie _after_ receiving absolute power attempting to get a promotion.  I
mentioned the dumb?)</p>

<p>Ah, Morgan Freeman is back.  FIXING THE MOVIE.  With a mop.  (There's
got to be bonus points for being able to pull something like that off
smoothly and with style.)</p>

<p>The last half hour or so was such an improvement over the previous mess
that I'm not going to

configs, but that didn't work either...  Ok, 696 is where armv4eb was
added in the first place: confirmed that worked.  So it broke somewhere
between 696 and 737...</p>

<p>Each build cycle takes just long enough for me to go do something
else while it builds, which adds time to the build because I forget and
don't promptly come back...</p>

<p>716 can't find the root filesystem, seems like it can't find the block
device.  710 can't either.  Nor can 700...</p>

<p>Armadillcon's opening ceremonies are in half an hour.  Trying to
work up the enthusiasm to go.</p>

<p>Although I volunteered to help out in the con suite, and repeatedly
poked them about it, I just checked my email and the last response I
have from the con suite people was two months ago.  I kind of doubt they
even remember me, let alone have any sort of "counting on me to show up"
kind of thing going on.</p>

<p>There's nothing in the panel schedule I want to go see.  The
closest is the "is Dr. Who speciesist?" panel, which is at least about
something I'm a fan of, but do I really want to see a property I like grilled
for political correctness for an hour?</p>

<p>Their guests are supposed to be the big draw, but I'm not a current fan
of any of them and only even recognize two (one because Fade read one
of his books, although she didn't recognize his name either until she
looked it up.  The other because she's Vernor Vinge's ex-wife, and I know
who he is).</p>

<p>In their list of 100+ panel participants I recognize six names.  (Seven
if you count the fact that Lawrence Person is listed twice.)  That's two
authors I haven't read anything by since before I met Fade and have already
seen at previous Armadillocons, two people I remember from Linucon, a local
journalist who I briefly followed on twitter but don't anymore, and the
convention's founder who I met at a party once.  That's it, out of a list
of over 100 people.  (Several other names look familiar, but I couldn't
tell you who they _are_.  Probably the same panelists I saw in 2005, 2004,
maybe even 1998...)</p>

<p>Their gaming is all Steve Jackson Games stuff (remember that
<a href="#12-07-2009">big bag of games</a> I dropped off at the concom
meeting I attended?  Either it was useless because they have a MIB
supplying them, or it's forming the core of their game room this year).
They're good games, but I don't have to leave home to play them.</p>

<p>Eh, maybe I'll go tomorrow.  I have a coupon for a $5 haircut that
expires today, and to be honest when comparing which I'd rather not miss,
the haircut is winning.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Ok, according to buildall.sh and smoketest-all.sh, nine targets are
working (armv4l, armv5l, armv6l, i586, i686, mips, mipsel, powerpc, and
x86_64).  Five are failing: armv4eb, m68k, powerpc-440fp, sh4,
and sparc.</p>

<p>I dunno what's up with armv4eb, the kernel boots fine but then it
can't run init.  The uClibc config has ARCH_WANTS_BIG_ENDIAN=y, and this
_used_ to work.  If it was a toolchain issue I'd expect the kernel build to
be horked.</p>

<p>The m68k problem is a known issue finding a good emulator for it.
Charles Stevens is making good progress on that, but it's not going in this
release.</p>

<p>The powerpc-440fp target is booting to a command prompt and running
just fine, but my first attempt to compile anything (forgetting to cd
out of the read-only /) went:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/ # gcc /usr/src/thread-hello2.c -lpthread
/usr/bin/../libexec/gcc/powerpc-unknown-linux/4.2.1/ld: cannot open output file a.out: Read-only file system
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
invalid/unsupported opcode: 1f - 0e - 02 (7d20009d) 10007f9c 1
Illegal instruction
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But when I did a cd /tmp (which has a tmpfs in it) and tried again,
it worked fine and "hello world" ran.  The odd part is that smoketest is
adding -o /tmp/hello to its output, I dunno why gcc would want to create
a temporary file in the current directory, or why its response would be
unsupported opcode if it did.  (Ok, ppc440 isn't _exactly_ a subset of
powerpc, so hitting that eventually makes sense.  This emulator's a very
loose fit for that target.  But hitting the problem _there_ is just
weird.)</p>

<p>I just ran smoketest.sh again on powerpc-440fp and it worked.  Something
slightly racy going on here, but since qemu couldn't boot it at all before,
I'm not calling this a regression, just something that needs work next
release.</p>

<p>The sh4 problem is actually that the target doesn't test well.  It
works fine from the command line but the serial driver eats unpredictable
amounts of data during initialization (I think it continuously resets it
until there's no more data coming in, so the build script I'm catting in to
qemu doesn't get run), and compilation is so slow that even building
hello world can time out.  (I'm not sure if this is a qemu problem or a
kernel problem, it's not that slow running actual code, but waits it does
for the emulated hardware devices can take a very long time.)</p>

<p>I suspect that the "cat a script into stdin/stdout of qemu" thing is going
to need something more "expect" like soonish, to get the reliability up.
Both seem to work fine when tested manually (albeit in the 440's case for
a definition of "fine" that merely avoids hitting a reproducible bug of
some kind).  But they flake a bit from smoketest.sh, and I admit dumping
most of a kilobyte of data in the input buffer all at once and hoping it
survives device initialization and gets read properly through /dev/console
is a bit suspect.  It needs more of a "wait for prompt, write response"
cycle ala expect.  Except expect is based on tcl and I'm not sucking in
those requirements, next time around maybe I can write a shell script that
does it.  (I did this once before in Python, but I don't want to introduce
that dependency either.)</p>

<p>And of course sparc never worked, although it's closer now than it
was.</p>

<p>So the only actual regression in the above is armv4eb.  I'll poke at it
a bit more, but I'm not holding the release past the weekend.</p>

<p>Armadillocon is tomorrow.</p>

<p>At Elze's new year's party, I shared a couch with three of the
Armadillocon organizers, who mentioned how "tired" the concom had gotten
and in need of new blood.  So I thought I'd volunteer, put my energy into
that instead of launching another of my own (as Stu and I were toying with
a year or so back).</p>

<p>The con chair this year turns out to be somebody I knew (she ran the
Linucon art show back in 2004), so I emailed her about my desire to
volunteer (and the _complete_ lack of contact information on the
armadillocon website).  She poked the appropriate person to post contact
info on the website, but never got back to me about volunteering.</p>

<p>I tried again after a few months, volunteering to help out with
programming, and exchanged a few emails with the head of programming
(once I asked the con chair why he hadn't responded and she got his
attention for me, anyway), but he never offered me any schedule slots to
fill or agreed "that sounds like a good panel idea, go do it".  Our
discussion never came down to anything _specific_ I could do for him,
and our discussion trailed off into unreturned emails.</p>

<p>About three months ago, I tried again by volunteering to help with the
con suite.  It's really really easy to come up with concrete stuff to do
there, and you don't have the "coordinating with fog" problem.  You bring
ingredients, you prepare food, it gets eaten.  Fairly straightforward.</p>

<p>My average was about three emails to to one response, but I eventually
did talk to the nice lady on the phone who's running it this year, and
explain lots of ideas that she seemed to think were good ones.  I arranged
to go to a concom meeting ot meet her in person, but when I went (last
month), she didn't show up to that meeting.  I haven't heard from her
since.</p>

<p>After the meeting we all went out to dinner at a restaurant across the
street from the convention hotel.  I talked a lot with the guy in charge
of programming I'd been emailing earlier (who had of course done the schedule
himself already, staffing it with pretty much the same panelists as last
year, you can <http://www.fact.org/dillo/programming/grid.html>see it
here</a>), and he mentioned that nobody had submitted a bid proposal to
become next year's con chair yet.  I started speculating about it, and
the two of us adjourned to the bar at the con hotel and spent hours specing
out a bid proposal.  (Things like "this person will be the fan guest of
honor anyway because the board already has its mind made up, so propose
them now in your initial guest list to avoid an argument".)  He was actually
quite encouraging.  I put together two complete guest lists (one a more
ambitious set of selections and a fallback set of more conservative ones),
and I wrote it up, and I emailed it off right before we went to
not-sword-camp.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, when I got back to Austin, I hadn't heard a thing
back about it.  So I emailed him to confirm he'd _gotten_ the bid proposal,
and asked how the meeting to discuss bid proposals had gone.  The reply was
that the meeting had been postponed, because someone already on the con
staff who had been thinking of submitting a bid had decided to submit one,
and they were waiting for that one.  Apparently, it hadn't occurred to him
to inform me of this.</p>

<p>So I told them to yank my bid.  I didn't say it was because the person
they've all known for 30 years is obviously going to get it and there's no
use wasting time pretending otherwise.  (Instead I made some excuse about
having to make work plans for the coming year and being unable to hold off
scheduling stuff any longer, which is also true.)  I assume he got this
email, I haven't heard anything from them since.</p>

<p>Not hearing back has always been the status quo in this relationship.
On average I've had to make about three attempts to get their attention
each time.  I tried four distinct approaches (ask the conchair where they
could use me, try to help with programming, try to help with consuite,
submit a bid proposal to become next year's con chair), and got
a nominally encouraging response at each stage.  But it was never
a "here's a concrete way you can help", and it immediately
lapsed into silence as soon as I stopped poking them.  I got exactly
zero follow-up initiated by the Armadillocon concom or staff, to anything.</p>

<p>I wanted to volunteer at this thing, and I tried repeatedly to find a
way to contribute, but new people expressing interest doesn't seem to
be something they're equipped to deal with.  They're just not set up to
handle it.  They seemed to _want_ to use me... and didn't know how.</p>

<p>Fade and I are still thinking of going.  (I may show up to the con
suite and try to volunteer in person, although there's probably not too
much I can do at this point.  Last time I was there, which was probably
2005, they had chips, two liter bottles of soda, and some M&amp;M's out.)</p>

<p>Fade looked at the guest list and commented that it has authors,
and its descriptions are what awards they've won without ever mentioning
the name of a single book any of them wrote.  (The awards are more important
than the books?)  And she was astonished they
don't have their own website, but a sub-page under some other website.
(It turns out they do, containing the same content, it's just the
10th hit on google.  That's how much they promote it.)  She said the
schedule seemed like the con was "a bunch of 50 year old men who
worship Heinlein".  She might stop by on Saturday anyway if I'm already
going, but won't head there on her own.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:661025>Here's a review of last year's Armadillocon.</a>  It talks about how
innovative they were in 1982.  It interviews someone who's been a panelist
for 14 years.  It points out that Armadillocon "isn't past
evolution" and gives as an example the new "Campfire Tales" event with
two authors named Joe (one born in 1943 and the other in 1951)
"swapping anecdoes for an audience".  It closes by hoping that the man
"scheduled to close Sunday's programming with a reading, just as he's done
for 25 years" will recover from his bypass surgery in time to do so.</p>

<p>Armadillocon's always been a fun con, I'm just wondering why anybody
under the age of 35 would even find out about it, let alone want to go to
the thing.  (Taken there by their parents, I expect.  Or grandparents...)</p>

<p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArmadilloCon#cite_note-0>Wikipedia
thinks</a> last year's attendance was around 400.  The first Armadillocon
I attended (in 1998) was at least twice that big.  The first year of
Penguicon got 500 and the second 800 (although that was up in Michigan and
leveraging the attendee mailing list and timeslot of the defunct
ConTraption).  The first year of Linucon got a little over 300, in Austin,
from a standing start.  I believe Ushicon's hit triple digits its second
year (again in Austin), mostly 12-18 year olds, although that's a bit of
an apples-to-oranges comparison with Anime vs literary SF.</p>

<p>Eh, it's the convention they want to run, which is not what I'd prefer it
to be.  Oh well, accept it and move on...</p>
</span>

<span id=programming>
<p>In FWL, taught the powerpc-440fp target to use the kernel and
qemu invocation from the normal powerpc build, since the 440 is more
or less a subset of the full powerpc instruction set, and the 440 toolchain
builds a root filesystem that'll run under full powerpc emulation.
(A little like running 386 code on x86_64: a proper specific emulator
would be nice because running under that doesn't guarantee it'll run
on real hardware, but Mark's already booted it on real hardware.  I need
to switch to 64k pages for the new stuff, though.  That'll probably require
separating the kernel .config and tweaking uClibc again.)</p>

<p>I also got sparc to build a static version, which booted to a shell
prompt under qemu (with busybox ash, anyway; bash hung), then gave me bus
error when I did "ls -l", and then hung when I did "echo *".  Still,
progress!  Checked it in.</p>

<p>And I checked in the old Tin Can Tools hammer/nail board config I
had lying around as a hw-tct-hammer target.  That's an armv4l derivative.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get the root-filesystem.sh design flaw at least
somewhat mitigated before cutting a release.  Adding the $ARCH prefix
to WRAPPER_TOPDIR should solve part of it.</p>

<p>Poking at some loose ends in FWL.  Upgrading various versions of the
kernel, busybox, and FWL, plus host-tools.sh needs to build the weird
QEMU snapshot out of source control that actually runs powerpc.  (Sigh.
I want to build a kernel that works with current qemu, but they're more
interested in accurately emulating hardware than having something you
can actually boot Linux on.  You'd think this wouldn't be a contradiction
in terms, but no...)</p>

<p>Woah, water pressure today is up to full.  I dunno if the city guy who
came out did something, or because I didn't get out of bed until 3pm.
(No, I didn't sleep through mark's morning call, I just went back to
bed afterwards.  He got 4 hours of sleep.  Yay sleep.)</p>

<p>West campus is sort of dead right now since last year's students have
moved out but the new ones haven't quite moved in yet.  (Lots of ripping
out of carpets, furniture winding up in dumpsters, and cleaning service vans
lurking in alleyways looking suspicious.)  The rezoning of everything from
3 stories to 5 stories back around 2005 means all the old houses got torn
down and replaced by big apartment buildings, and I was assuming the
water mains were overtaxed by the increased urban density.  But according to
the email I just got, they replaced the building's water meter, which was
only putting out 20% of what it should have.  (Yay, water pressure!)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Finally got armv4l building with soft float.  THAT was a pain.</p>

<p>The script reorganizing thing was just too brittle and didn't fix
the real problem, which was in gcc.  So I dug through gcc to figure out
how to get it to build libgcc_eh.a in --disable-shared mode, since
.a files are static libraries, not shared libraries.</p>

<p>The control logic for this goes like this: when you run ./configure,
it makes a file "Makefile" in the top level directory of the gcc build,
more or less using "Makefile.in" as a template.  You have to feed
8 gazillion command line arguments and environment variables into ./configure,
which is the records in the resulting Makefile.  In theory you can
then run "make configure-gcc" to perform configuration in the various
subdirectories (the most interesting of which is the "gcc" subdirectory),
and it'll pass along the gorp you fed to the top level configure.  In
reality, it doesn't always pass all of it along.  Worse, that only
performs about half of the necessary configuration, and that doesn't
include the decision whether or not to build libgcc_eh.a.</p>

<p>No, that decision is done when you run the "make all-gcc" step,
and it compiles lots and lots of stuff, and mixed in with that it
eventually decides it needs the file "gcc/mklibgcc".  This file is
a shell script, which is created from mklibgcc.in by this chunk
of gcc/Makefile (which was itself generated from gcc/Makefile.in):</p>

<blockquote><pre>
mklibgcc: $(srcdir)/mklibgcc.in
        CONFIG_FILES=mklibgcc CONFIG_HEADERS= ./config.status
</pre></blockquote>

<p>So right, we're running the file "config.status", possibly out of
the gcc subdirectory or possibly out of the top level directory (depending
on whether gcc/Makefile.in is a recursive makefile invocation or an
included makefile segment), which generates a shell script.  Here's
the difference in the resulting shell script based on whether or you
passed in --disable-shared or --enable-shared in the top level ./configure
invocation:</p>

<blockquote><pre>

<p>So various tests in the generated shell script are hardwired in by
the process that generates it.  (Wheee.)  But they're still if
statements.</p>

<p>So anyway, after the Makefiles invoked by "make gcc-all" stage
generate this shell script, they then run it, passing it in over 100 lines
of environment variables to tell it what to do.  This script outputs
a new file, "libgcc.mk".  That's right, the configure sage creates a top
level Makefile which creates a gcc/Makefile which calls another script
to create a new shell script which when called generates a new makefile!</p>

<p>If this sounds like a horrible tangled mess of evil, welcome to the
gcc build process.</p>

<p>After drilling through this crap for days, I found out that forcing
it to always create libgcc_eh.a turns out to be this patch:</p>

<p>Note that the above gets it to build this library, but doesn't actually
get the "make install" stage to copy it to the target.  (No, that would be
too easy.)</p>

<p>Now here's the fun part: that library doesn't contain the soft-float
code.  It turns out, that for the "arm/t-linux" target, _nothing_
contains the soft float code, because if you're running Linux obviously
you have a floating point coprocessor!  Nope, the target that contains
the soft-float code is the "arm/t-arm-elf" target, I.E. the one that
essentially says you're building code to run on the bare metal without
an OS.</p>

<p>So I dug up the previous patch that was applying to 4.1.2, and now
with a better understanding of what it was _doing_ (I.E. convincing gcc not
to make unfounded gnu-bigoted assumptions about Linux, with a hammer to
the forehead if necessary), tweaked it to apply to 4.2.1.  And lo, it
worked!</p>

<p>Up until 5am playing Sims 3, slept past noon, the water went out during
my shower (to the point where the pipe was sucking air _in_, which can't
be good), but the condo association people say that the city of Austin water

someone out to re-enact Flanders and Swann's "The Gas Man Cometh", but I

I'm recovering from a sunburn.  Wonder how I managed that?</p>

<p>Fighting with armv4l.  This would be easier if I could pick an approach,
but there are at least three horrible ways to fix this, all of which suck,
and each time I step back to summarize the problem the grass looks greener
in one of the _other_ approaches.  (Well, not kernel-side soft float, that
code's slow and buggy.  It's buggy because it doesn't get much testing,
because it doesn't get much use, because it's fundamentally so slow.  If it
was _just_ slow I might go for it, but add in the buggy...)</p>

<p>But I keep going back and forth on the "patch gcc to do this _right_" vs
"reorder my scripts and hope I can sequence my way around the sheer horror of
gcc" approaches, especially since the second makes it harder to fix the
design flaw in my scripts.  (Each layer is supposed to be orthogonal, but
I recently figured out that root-filesystem.sh has some fairly deeply baked
in assumptions that it's using a cross compiler with my ccwrap.c.  Unless
you BUILD_STATIC, anyway.)</p>

<p>Finally watching the most recent bleach disk (volume 18).  This entire
disk feels like filler.  It's not that it's going slowly (this often happens
in anime), it's that NOTHING IS HAPPENING.  (Very energetically, of course,
but there are reaction shots for everything.  A scene went by where every
single person in a group of about 8 people had a "stop and say somebody's
name in shock" moment.  I should fire up my cell phone and see if the
"Overtaking the Manga" entry on tvtropes mentions this episode by name.)</p>

<p>Ah, an episode and a half in they finally get their theme music power
up, and the Vampires of Gratuitous Renaming turned to dust about sixty
seconds later.  There were maybe fifteen minutes of plot between the two
episodes, combined.  Ok, episode three is back to being merely slow.  The
"long artistic pauses in semi-romantic dialog.</p>

<p>Ah, and the last episode on this disk seems to be the start of a new
season in Japan.  (There's no obvious correspondence between where Viz the
importer split the DVDs and anything the Japanese are doing.)
You can tell because the credits changed again, and now the opening theme
music is in english.  Must boggle.</p>

<p>The Japanese seem to treat english the way we treat latin and
french.  Throwing the occasional english phrase into Japanese produces a
certain "Je na sais quois", QED.  This isn't just a phrase or two, the
lyrics to this entire song are in english, and it's not exactly playing
to their strengths.  The singer seems to be doing some kind of vague Bruce
Springsteen impersonation that winds up sounding like he has has a mouth
full of novacaine.  It's english with an andalusian lisp (excuse me:
lithp) and occasional glitched bit of syntax, ala "to start up new
day".  (For some reason the fact the lyrics are nonsense like
"tonight love is rationed" doesn't bother me much, because they always were.
So are most of ours, really.)</p>

<p>I saw a chinese article the other day about their mars probe, which had
a sentence "the mars and the earth", and couldn't immediately explain why
it's just mars and not "the mars", but it's ok to stick the in front of
earth.  I don't blame people for getting english wrong, we do all the time
and the british (who invented it) point and laugh at us even when we think
we're doing it right.  It's an ad-hoc language at best.  Latin again.</p>

he was unable to sleep.  I had him email me a data dump of his complaints,
and I'll try to sort through it and organize something he can present in
the morning.  I told him to call me when he gets up, and I'll give him a
nice coherent summary of it.  (Psychologically, this means it's now my
problem, so hopefully he can stop worrying about it long enough to get
some sleep.)</p>

I should really post this sort of thing somewhere people can _reply_ to it.
This blog is really easy for me to do (especially when LJ is ddosed or I'm

feed creator to do searchable feeds.  I know how, I just haven't done it
yet.  What was that about the cobbler's children having no shoes?</p>

<p>Went over to Mark's today so we could work on podcasts.  Wrote up a couple
dozen potential podcast topics, and he set up his little camera thingy and we
found out we're both quite camera shy when the little red light is on.  (No,
turning the little red light off would not improve matters.)  What happens
during the recording is _not_ natural conversation, and I'd like to credit
Terry Pratchett for being able to blame "bloody quantum" for it.  We need
to try again with scripts.</p>

<p>Biked to chick-fil-a again.  Only brought one water bottle this time, and
it was frozen.  It was still just about frozen solid when I got here, which was
somewhat unexpected.</p>

<p>It's only 80 calories/gram to melt water, you'd think it would happen
faster, but apparently no.  The fact it was carbonated so I couldn't _open_
it until it was sufficiently melted without spraying water everywhere didn't
help.  About 3/4 of the way here I got sick of the "twist the cap slightly,
watch the air gap shrink, close it again" approach, which was accomplishing
nothing, and opened it on the sidewalk and let it fountain for almost a full
minute (quite impressive considering how thin the layer of water around the
edge had been), after which there was essentially no liquid left in there,
and it was still full of ice.  I'm still not quite sure how that works.</p>

<p>Got here.  Got a large diet Dr. Pepper.  Proceeded to drain it and do an
almost cartoonish flop-sweat, which probably means I did something unhealthy
again.  (I'm in air conditioning now!  Stop with the sweating!)  Oh well.
Yay for refills, I shall go get my third now.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Charles Stevens says that the main problem with the FWL sparc target is
dynamic linking, and if you statically link busybox you get a mostly working
root filesystem (modulo some unaligned access errors and such which should
be fixed upstream in busybox).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, setting BUILD_STATIC in sources/targets/sparc/details
turns out to have a sequencing issue: STATIC_FLAGS is set at the end of
sources/include.sh, but the architecture config file doesn't get read until
after sources/include.sh returns.</p>

<p>Currently only cross-compiler.sh and root-filesystem.sh pay attention
to that flag, so if I move setting STATIC_FLAGS to the check_for_base_arch
function things will work.  But that means that things that don't check
for an architecture (I.E. host-tools.sh) can't have BUILD_STATIC support
added in future.  I think I'm ok with that, though.</p>
</span>

<p>Oooh, mood crashing.  Yeah, I gave myself mild heatstroke biking here.
(The "stop sweating until you drink more" thing was a bit of a
hint.  Tired, don't wanna do nothing, must nap now.  I'm over an hour's
bike ride from home, though.  I have penguin mints to see me through this.)</p>

<p>The wireless here at chick-fil-a went down, so I fired up my cell phone
internet, and it worked for about 20 minutes before Ubuntu's kernel went:</p>

<blockquote><pre>

<p>And so on, and so forth.  I need to reboot now, but I left my cell phone
charging cable at home and I've got plenty of stuff to do that doesn't
require internet.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I'm always amused by the people who assume constant internet connectivity
will make all apps migrate to "the cloud".  Even when there aren't distributed
denial of service attacks crippling half the social networking sites out
there, and nobody's put a backhoe through a major fiber trunk this week,
I'm usually happy to have a battery on my laptop (and the commercial guys use
UPS battery backup thingies) because after 100 years we still can't reliably
deliver electricity, let alone internet.  How does adding a second point of
failure to the equation improve matters?  I've seen three datacenters flooded,
and my local stuff still needs to connect to it so local potential for
failure doesn't go away either...</p>

<p>And the Chick-fil-a is closing up, time to go home.</p>

<p>Biking home, I was stopped by two pretty and athletic girls who needed
directions to their hotel.  Luckily my laptop and cell phone were willing to
talk to each other after a reboot, and Google coughed up an address.</p>

<p>Partly because they were seemed with Austin, and partly because they were
too drunk to walk straight (one of 'em clocked herself but good on a traffic
signal box and didn't seem to notice), I escorted them the dozen or so blocks
there.  (I was out biking for exercise, doesn't really matter where
specifically I go.)</p>

<p>From their drunken arguments along the way, I learned that they're both
seargents (army, I think; it explained the camo baseball cap the blonde was
wearing), they're shipping out to Iraq for a year-long deployment in the next
day or so, and one of them was trying very hard to hit on the other to
the point where even I could spot it.  (Unsuccessfully, I think, but I didn't
ask and couldn't really tell.  They were _really_ drunk, and alternated
fighting with each other and hugging.)</p>

<p>I left them at their hotel (this being me I forgot to ask either one's
name, but gave them both business cards anyway since I still have half of
the box Kinkos printed for me 5 years ago), and biked home.  On the way
home I regretted not passing along Fade's advice about avoiding hangovers
(Drink lots of water and take 2 ibuprofen before going to bed)</p>

<p>Of course back at the condo, two unrelated buff naked women were frolicking
in the pool, giggling loudly and continuously while their boyfriends (who
were both wearing bathing suits for some reason) took pictures.  Usually
this doesn't start until around 2am, but it _is_ Saturday...</p>

<p>I of course went inside to be mobbed by four cats and watch Mythbusters on
my laptop (escape from Alcatraz episode, working my way through unabridged
first season instead of the subset available on DVD) while working on
fixing native toolchain creation for armv4l soft float.  (I've got the design
elements worked out, but the sequencing of the whole root-filesystem.sh
script is getting kind of horrible and I need to back up and rethink it.)</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm a geek.  I know.  How we ever managed to reproduce frequently
enough to get this far is a mystery.  Recessive genes, I expect.</p>

<p>I am amused that Fade's two cats have figured out that small pieces of
bologna are edible, but my two ex-feral cats sniff it politely and move
on.  It's not kibble.  They've retired from the whole "eating things that
are not kibble" business.  Although dragon likes tea, diet coke, and tomato
sauce, and both will bug me every time I open a can because of the small
chance I might pour tuna water in a bowl for them to drink, whether or not
the can contained peas to begin with.  But those are beverages, which are
a separate issue.</p>

<p>I believe Fade gets back from Seattle on tuesday.</p>

<a name="07-08-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#07-08-2009">August 7, 2009</a></h2>
<p>So twitter still won't let firefox users post to it.  (No, it's not just
me, it's continuing fallout from the denial of service attack thingy.)  You
can try all you like, it just gets filtered and times out.  There are
a number of twitter clients for Linux, but I don't want one.  I like using
the web browser for this.</p>

<p>Home alone.  Bored.  Fade remains in Seattle.  (<a href=http://twitter.com/fadeaccompli>She can post to twitter from her mac, though.</a>)  I want to go
bike somewhere but it was 107 outside today.</p>

<p>Decided to invite a neighbor out to a restaurant, but the cute next door
neighbor with the marvelous singing voice (Aiesha) is busy packing because
she's moving out tomorrow.  The next neighbor down (Nimra) isn't there.
(She's also moving out this month, but her router still shows up in the local
wifi list so apparently it's not quite final yet?)  Two doors the other way,
the two visiting german guys were apparently only here for the summer, and
left while Fade and I were at not-sword-camp.  The unit at the far end had a
"for rent" sign on it until yesterday, and another unit is listed with real
estate agents (and thus google maps brings it up every time I map this
building).  The unit that had the neighbors who kept jumping into the pool
loudly at 3am has been dark for days when it used to be party central 24/7,
I dunno if they're still there either.</p>

<p>That's a downside of living this close to campus, you never really get to
know your neighbors.  It's August, everybody moves.  I've owned this condo
since 2003, but the only other people I've known in the building (or any of
the adjacent ones) were the other people living here in this unit.</p>

<p>Today I submitted a resume to a team lead job here in Austin that pays six
figures, and looks like something I could pretty comfortably do.  I also
picked up an application to teach SAT/GRE prep at the place in the
Dobie Mall which is unlikely to pay even half that.  I believe my job
search can now officially be considered "eclectic".</p>

<p>I _like_ teaching, and want to get back into it, and the commute would be
about 3 minutes by bicycle and less than ten on foot.  (One of these days I
need to take another stab at grad school, so I can get a day job as community
college faculty.)  But I also admit a change of pace would be nice.</p>

<p>I have yet to search for actual embedded Linux jobs, because I want to take
a weed-whacker to BusyBox and trim out massive overgrowth, I want to yell
at the uClibc guys about still not having any kind of release schedule,
and want to yell at the kernel guys for days on a number of topics (sysfs
needs a stable API so userspace and do device enumeration without needing
a kernel-version-specific tool, using in-band signalling is stupid and
wouldn't be nearly as big of a problem if the scsi layer didn't intentionally
discard transport type information, putting perl in the kernel build was
just horrible).  I have nothing left to say to the gcc developers and hope
something comes along to obsolete that project, but unfortunately tinycc
won't be it.  I'm still sort of engaging with the qemu guys on and off,
but it's frustrating and regression-filled and even THEY don't know what
their license is anymore... (Does "gpl" mean v2 or v3? They want to take code
from both the kernel and binutils, and hope if they close their eyes and don't
talk about it the fact the two projects' licenses are now 100% incompatible
will just go away.)</p>

<p>It's too much, and it doesn't change anything.  Remember the line
in "Men at Arms" about Sam Vimes "vibrating with the internal anger of a man
who wants to arrest the gods for not doing it right"?  (Page 372 according
to Google Books.)  I feel a bit like that at times.  I've spent years being
driven by a frustration with the status quo and a vision of how it SHOULD work,
but since I started things may actually have gotten worse.  The uClibc project
once had regular releases.  Of all the things you could say about BusyBox back
then, "it's too big and complicated" wasn't at the top of the list.  Building
your own kernel and running it on your system was a fairly low hurdle.  Nobody
expected the FSF to emerge from irrelevance like a thrice-killed horror
villain and needlessly fork the community with the GPLv2/v3 split.</p>

<p>It's tiring.  If there was one GOOD project I could point
to and say "This I like, let's build out from there", that would be one thing.
BusyBox used to be such a project, until Bruce Perens poisoned it by being his
usual Schlameil self and drooling GPLv3 onto a list he'd never previously
posted on.  (Yes, I am still bitter.)  I tried switching to tinycc but
the existing community was too stuck where they were, and wouldn't come
along, and no new community would form while the old one exerted its
gravitational pull to "stay where we are, and add better Windows support to
that".</p>

<p>So a vacation from all that might be nice.</p>

<p>"Change to what" is still a pointed question.  Not a lot of Lua stuff
out there, and most of the Python jobs want you to know .NET as well, which
ain't happening.  (I don't care how burned out on Linux I get, I don't do
Windows.  I'd become an accountant first.)  I'm stale on Javascript and
CSS but wouldn't mind coming back up to speed on that.  Still haven't got a
mac, so can't learn proper mac programming...</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>I know XKCD does a better job <a href=http://xkcd.com/619/>mocking the
very idea</a> of Linux on the desktop than I'm likely to, but I just hit
one more little bit of fun and I need to vent.</p>

<p>I try to back up a couple of directories to a 16 gigabyte USB key every
once in a while.  I'm using rsync, which means A) it's ignoring the existing
files completely and copying the entire contents of the file over again, even
when they're mbox files that just got appended to, B) it's doing so at
83k/second  for a file that's about a gigabyte.  I went out to lunch and it
wasn't finished with the file when I came back.</p>

<p>Apparently, the new version of Ubuntu A) broke rsync somehow (so it's
copying the whole file and can't be convinced to append to the existing
one), B) regressed the USB drivers so it's mounting it as USB 1.x instead of
2.0 (thus being insanely slow).</p>

<p>Wheee.  More stuff that (I think) used to work, and doesn't anymore.  (We
<strike>regret</strike> regression test nothing!)</p>

<p>Of course the behavior of the Linux kernel when memory is filled up with
disk cache that flushes to a slow device is "fun".  And its decisions about
how much memory it will allow each device to pin assume they all write at
the same rate.</p>
</span>

<a name="06-08-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#06-08-2009">August 6, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Today's twitter feed is full of comments about some kind of <a href=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/08/06/twitter.attack/>denial of
service attack on twitter</a>.  I tried to respond to three different tweets,
and post a new one, and none of them went through.  Livejournal times out
trying to post as well.  (Both sites _read_ just fine, but I expect there's
static cacheing going on in both cases.)  Oh, and I had to substitute out
Road Runner's DNS with the one I have memorized (4.2.2.1) to get to anything
to resolve.  The internet is unwell, it seems.</p>

<p>The new observation was merely a standard cat post: "Aubrey has recovered
enough from her surgery to shed at full capacity again.  Probably a good
sign."  I can write it here, in my little text file I edit with vi and
rsync as I remember, and the modern high-tech sites will presumably
recover and start working again at some point.</p>

<p>I also wanted to twitter a link to this
<a href=http://reason.tv/video/show/mythbusting-with-adam-savage>marvelous
interview with Adam Savage of Mythbusters</a>, and couldn't.</p>

<p>Eventually, people will figure out that Windows being a horribly insecure
pile of garbage that's the perfect incubator for botnets is a problem.
Can we change the law so people can legally portscan computers for
obviously known vulnerabilities, infect them, and shut them down?  If your
computer is a danger to itself and others, some kind of law enforcement effort
to find and stop vulnerable machines becomes inevitable at some point.
Can we skip to that part please?  We don't allow drunk drivers on the road,
but we do allow unpatched windows machines on the net.  Amazing.</p>

<p>And yes, go after vulnerable Mac and Linux machines too.  Not that either
is a big enough target to make botnets out of, but the principle's the
same.  I'm not saying wipe people's data, I'm saying switch the machine
off and have it boot up to a simple explanation screen when the human is
back in front of it.  You left a vulnerable machine attached to the net.
It probably already has viruses on it.  Go get it fixed before connecting
it back to the internet.</p>

<p>We don't need laws passed to do this.  We don't even need law enforcement
to do this.  We need laws to explicitly _allow_ this, so ISP people defending
the net from flawed machines don't get prosecuted for doing so.</p>

<p>Biked to chick-fil-a (oh _WOW_ am I out of shape).  Stopped by
the remaining bike store to get the seat replaced first.  (It was broken
when my bike got hit by a car, a little metal thing under the seat that used
to be a loop no longer looped, and although I bent it back several times it
rattled at best and didn't stay bent.  Seat wanted to flip up like a trash
can lid, which is unpleasant while sitting on it.)  Dropped $35 on a new
highly squishy one, which they installed for free.  It is more buttocks-shaped
than I'm used to in a bike seat, but I suppose that makes a sort of sense.</p>

<p>Made it here, with several stops to rest in the shade and drain a bottle
and a half of tea (one of which was frozen when I started).  According to
the internet, it's 101 farenheit.  Welcome to Texas in August.  (It's too
hot to _swim_ when the sun is up.  I've learned to spot the nauseous out
of breath feeling that's the first sigh of heatstroke for me, and means
_stop_now_ for at least a couple minutes.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>The new "Fedora 11 doesn't work" bug seems to actually be "distcc and
FWL don't play nice together", which actually makes sense if you stop and
think about it.  The clever things distcc is doing break when builds try
to do strange things, and both host-tools.sh and uClibc's build are the
height of strangeness in this regard.  I'll see if I can work around it.</p>

<p>I seem to have actually recovered some enthusiasm for poking at toybox
again, which is odd.  There's no _point_ to it, I'm not working towards a
goal.  I just haven't fiddled with any actual programming stuff in C lately,
and I'm feeling a bit rusty.  It's like whittling a stick to make nothing but
sawdust, or building a house of cards.  It doesn't need a point, it's something
to do.</p>

<p>I wonder if I should do the buffer applet I've been pondering for a while.
(As with "count", which became busybox's pipe_progress when I submitted it,
there wasn't one when I decided I needed this.  Since then I've seen somebody
write a halfway version that doesn't do everything I want it to do.  A
proper buffer command needs ratelimiting too.)</p>

<p>Ok, this is one of the reasons I despise gcc.  If you write a file
containing one line, "#include &lt;zlib.h&gt;", and you write it as temp.c and
run "gcc -E temp.c", it spits out hundreds of lines of the contents of
zlib.h.  Which it should, because -E says spit out the preprocessor output.
But if you go:</p>

<blockquote>
echo "#include &lt;zlib.h&gt;" | gcc -E -
</blockquote>

<p>It outputs:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
# 1 "&lt;stdin&gt;"
# 1 "&lt;built-in&gt;"
# 1 "&lt;command-line&gt;"
# 1 "&lt;stdin&gt;"
include &lt;zlib.h&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is the behavior different?  The file is coming from stdin instead of
from a filename, and the preprocessor completely melts down and doesn't
do its job.</p>

<p>I mention this because squashfs requires zlib to build, and I want to
test if it's installed and skip it cleanly (or die with a more explicit
message) if it's not there.  I also don't want to assume that the host's
headers are at /usr/include, and there's no obvious way to get gcc to dump
its header search path.  ("gcc --print-search-dirs" shows the library
search path, and the executable path (which should just be $PATH but this
is gcc so of course they reinvented the wheel).  "gcc -dumpspecs" doesn't show
it, and note that "gcc --dumpspecs" doesn't work because it's gcc.
The uClibc build uses a dirty trick, "gcc --print-file-name=include", to get
the gcc internal #include directory.  Note that in this case "include" isn't
a file, it's a directory, and it's only coincidentally installed in a
directory that's in the library search path, but it prints it anyway and
all anybody cares is that the trick _works_.  But that's not the
directory that would contain zlib.h.</p>

<p>Have I mentioned I hate gcc with the flame of a thousand suns?  Recently,
I mean?  This stuff is SIMPLE if you understand it.  I can only assume the
people who implemented the gcc front-end don't understand what a compiler
_does_.  It's not brain surgery!</p>
</span>

<p>Ah, it turns out the twitter/livejournal/facebook attack was
<a href=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10305200-245.html>political</a>,
some Russians trying to silence a Georgian blogger, and attacking US services
to do so.  I wonder what the Feds will do in response?  (Hands up everybody

<a name="05-08-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#05-08-2009">August 5, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Locked myself out of my car again, buying groceries from the 24 hour
HEB on 43rd street.  I feel _really_ stupid.  The American Autoduel
Association says it'll be an hour.  I'm glad I didn't buy the ice cream.</p>

<p>(When it's going on midnight, realizing you haven't actually had anything to
eat all day except a slim-fast and some penguin mints, going grocery
shopping might not be your best move.  Now arranging dinner on the hood of my
car, rummaging around in the things I bought to find things edible in the
near term.  The bananas/carrot sticks/granola bars are ok, but these
microwaveable bagel sticks are a lot better when you have access
to a Microwave.)</p>

<p>Before that, I went to Mark's and fed his cats again and changed the
litter box so it wasn't completely disgusting, and wound up staying there
downloading anime from his server until it got dark.</p>

<p>Before _that_ I was answering FWL bug reports.  No, I haven't checked
any job postings in two days.  My definition of "job hunting" has not
yet involved a lot of hunting for jobs, I need to get on that...</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Got another report on the mailing list of somebody else trying to build on
Fedora 11 and not being able to.  Fired up qemu and trying to reproduce it.
Building fine for me so far.  (It's only up to binutils, but they said
it was the same distcc problem.  I thought I'd rsynced my changes up to
the server.  It's the same script that updates my blog, which has
admittedly been a bit patchy lately.)</p>

<p>Somebody else tried to use the m68k target (for which qemu doesn't
work), and then fell back to using the powerpc target (qemu again).
I pointed 'em at mips, which is a nice big endian test environment.</p>
</span>

<p>Yay, the locksmith is here.</p>

<a name="04-08-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#04-08-2009">August 4, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Saw Fade off to the airport for a week in Seattle, re-read half of
"Wintersmith" by Terry Pratchett, then sat down to get some programming
done.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Got the powerpc kernel build and calling userspace, but it hangs two letters
into outputting "hello world" when it gets to userspace.  Pinged the qemu list,
but I haven't got a _clue_ what's up with that.  (This is with today's git
version.  This is a kernel derived from the supposedly working debian .config,
minus all the modules, plus squashfs.)</p>

<p>Heard back from Charles Stevens about the status of m68k, some discussion
on the list about that.  I need to ping the qemu list about the status of
the m68k work, but I need to catch up on reading it first.</p>

<p>Taught the rest of root-filesystem.sh to build static binaries.  The only
dynamic binaries now are hello-dynamic and ldd (which is a uClibc build issue
that seems hardwired, might have to patch the makefile).  This could help
sparc, since dynamic linking seems to be the main problem with it.</p>

<p>Still haven't tackled armv4l-soft yet.  An externally imposed schedule
on this project would be nice, my release date's slipped over a month
already.  (Feature creep is no excuse.)</p>
</span>

<a name="03-08-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#03-08-2009">August 3, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Ok, job hunting.  My <a href=http://landley.net/resume.html>resume</a>
is up to date, sent off a few emails to the recent "low hanging fruit"
contracts, and pulled up several more things I haven't replied to yet...
Now I'm at the "ok, what do I want to _do_" stage.</p>

<p>Obviously I could take any arbitrary 6 month contract that paid well
enough, but I'm tired of the career equivalent of one night stands.</p>

<p>I may also be getting tired of Linux.  Not sure yet.  I know I'm _frustrated_
with it.  I'm taking my various "how Linux on the desktop failed" snippets and
writing a longish hopefully difinitive rant to post on my livejournal account
(where drama belongs), but the point is, do I want to focus on embedded Linux
or try something new?  Embedded Linux is still more fun than regular Linux, and
I'm really good at it, but it's still less fun than it used to be.</p>

<p>It's clear where the most _money_ is.  I wouldn't get anything like my normal
consulting rate doing things I'm not an acknowledged expert in.  But money has
never been the primary motivating factor in my career, and I can always become
an expert in new things.  Learning and growing is better than being stuck in
a rut...</p>

<p>I used to like gui development at Quest and WebOffice and such (and before
that on OS/2, under DOS, even a little on the Sun workstations at Rutgers).
I'd enjoy getting back into that.  Plus I have a lot of potential enthusiasm for
learning Mac programming, currently stymied by my continuing lack of excuse
for buying my own mac.  (I accidentally left my backpack with my laptop in it
at the restaurant at lunch, but they had it behind the counter when I went
back for it.  I actually had mixed feelings about this.  Yes fade and mark
have macs I've been able to use, but it's not the same as having your own
dedicated mac laptop with you all the times.)  A day job working on
macs would be just about ideal for both goals, but there's a chicken and egg
problem getting one.</p>

<p>I suppose I could look for a job working in Lua.  Or Python 3.0.
Those I've halfway learned already and would love an excuse to really
bear down on.  (I learn really fast when motivated, I've just been unmotivated
for months now, due to falling out of love with Linux.)</p>

<p>The fun jobs tend to be the ones where other people find me, which is
never entirely controllable (often coming in floods where I turn people down
followed by droughts where nobody askes), and hasn't happened much the past
few months (possibly due to the recession, possibly because I haven't been
going to conferences and posting on lists much so I'm not out there for them
to find).  I've only even been updating my blog somewhat intermittently.</p>

<p>The downside of most of my technical contacts and resources being through
the internet is that the work I know about tends to be happening hundreds
if not thousands of miles away.  I've moved for jobs (spent a year and a half
in Pittsburgh for TimeSys, and Oxford tends to come up with per-diem contracts
which means you get a tax break for living way away from home), and had various
other half-hearted offers I haven't really pursued in canada and california
and so on.  I have cats, we can't just pick up and move easily.</p>

<p>I keep trying to get a master's degree (on and off, last time was 2005)
because of the various types of work I've enjoyed, teaching seems to offer the
best mix of fun, stability, and money.  You don't have to worry about finding
a new project twice a year, it doesn't have the starvation wages of most
writing gigs, it doesn't go into overtime crisis and eat your life
regularly...  But it needs credentials, not just the ability to do the job.
I need to sit down and spend two years of prep work, and it's hard to focus
on that when there's so much else I could be doing.  (If I enjoyed the classes
I wouldn't mind so much, but so far graduate computer science puts me firmly
in ivory tower academia where what I'm learning is _useless_ and I know it.)</p>

<p>I should get back to work poking at powerpc and fixing armv4l-soft for
FWL, but as with toybox, it's increasingly hard to _care_.  Bad sign, that.
I need something that matters to _other_ people for a bit, so I can borrow
their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Poked at powerpc a bit, trying to get a kernel that works with the current
qemu-git, rather than the a months-old repository snapshot that was between
the bugs in different release versions.  Aurelien Jarno was kind enough to
send me the .config of a system that's booting for him, based on debian's
powerpc kernel, but as with most distro .configs it's enormous, has 8
gazillion modules, and expects you to have an initramfs find the actual
boot device so some fairly vital drivers aren't statically linked.
(And for some reason, console=ttyS0 doesn't work with this even though
I got at least that much working with current -git, now it's ttyPZ0 for
some reason.  *shrug*  Ok?)</p>

<p>Progress has been made, but it's one of those whack-a-mole evenings.
Might get more done at the laundromat this evening.</p>
</span>

<p>As of August 1st, I'm officially job hunting again.  Monday I should
actually _do_ some.</p>

<a name="01-08-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#01-08-2009">August 1, 2009</a></h2>
<p>A day of fail.  (I accomplished nothing, and will now describe it in
detail.  Skipping this entry might be a good idea if you value your sanity.)</p>

<p>My attempt to deliver Fade her morning can of coffee, heated
up, resulted in smacking her in the nose with it and leaving a noticeable
scratch and bruise.  Then we went to the UT informal classes registration
desk, and found they've adjourned for two weeks until the semester starts.
(This is the class that had already filled up the previous three times we
tried to register for it, and which I registered for on thursday.)</p>

<p>Fade wants to learn Flash programming and the normal Flash authoring tools
for mac are insanely expensive, so we went to the campus computer store to
try to exercise a student discount.  They're closed for the weekend.</p>

<p>Next up, trying to figure out why her white macbook's battery suddenly
stopped working at sword camp.  The battery tester button on the bottom lights
up all five lights green, but the laptop itself is convinced there's no
battery.  So we went to "Happy Mac" on fifty-threeth street and they said
that white macbook batteries commit seppuku all the time, and the problem
was so bad they used to have a web page to get a free replacement, but it
expired.  He borrowed a battery out of another laptop he was working on and
booted Fade's laptop with it fine, so the problem is clearly the battery,
but he didn't have a spare to sell us.  (He just does repair, he has to
order parts.)</p>

<p>So we headed to the Apple Store, up in <i>The Domain</i>, for which the
phrase "die yuppie scum" was invented.  (It used to be IBM's main austin campus,
back when things <strike>like PowerPC chips</strike> were manufactured in
the US.  These days, it's a bunch of retail stores underneath apartments that
are _way_ too expensive to afford if you work retail.  Doesn't make any sense
to me either.)</p>

<p>It turns out that the pretentiousness of Apple Stores and the pretentiousness
of <i>The Domain</i> stack, to the point where I wanted to beat the guy who
asked us if we had "an appointment with a genious" to death with his own
clipboard within ten seconds of meeting him.  He actually did the looking
down his nose thing at us, with a snooty accent.  His performance literally
rendered me speechless, which means I didn't tell him that according to the
original Lewis Terman definition from 1916 I made it with 4 points to spare
on the last IQ test I remember the result of, which was when I was 10.  (I
also made it into Mensa, which is where I met Kelly and Steve, although I
haven't paid dues since the late 90's so my membership's long expired.)
I also didn't say "I don't have an appointment with your trained monkey doing
tech support in a retail location, but I just wanna either buy a battery or
get in on the replacement program".  (Not that either reaction would actually
have been helpful, but DUDE.  My reaction was strong enough I almost got
PHYSICALLY ILL.)</p>

<p>It was also overwhelmed.  The guy broke character long enough to tell us
the barton creek Apple Store is "closed for remodeling" so The Domain one was
packed wall to wall, and we more or less ran for our lives.</p>

<p>I note at this point that Apple has some strange Hippie/Yuppie alliance
going on.  (The Happy Mac guy was a young not-quite-hippie, very friendly,
quiet little shop full of electronic clutter and a dozen half-assembled
machines including an old "Karate Champ" upright arcade console.  Happily
diagnosed our problem without charging us, and apologized for not being
able to fix it.  I was sorry we couldn't give him our business.)  The thing
is, the hippies provide the technical expertise and the yuppies provide the
money.  I think what I reacted to was snooty yuppies with pretensions of
technical competence.  (Yes, Apple has it, but not so much Apple _stores_.)</p>
 
<p>Next stop was Fry's, which had a nice little shelf of batteries with a
neatly labeled empty space for the one we needed.  They had every other type
of Apple battery in stock, just not this one.  And according to their
tech, the respawns are fairly random.  Fry's was also swamped, Fade's theory
was back-to-school shoppers, but the demographics didn't match up.  (By
this point, Fade was Unhappy, and by the third set of synchronized slow
walkers side by side blocking the whole aisle for no readily apparent reason,
I was getting a bit annoyed myself.)</p>

<p>Stu called while we were heading to lunch (Chic-fil-a, also packed solid
with a long line at 2pm, no explanation for that either) and suggested
we try "batteries plus" on the northeast corner of Burnett and Anderson,
and we tried that next.  Their computer said they had the battery we
needed ($150, ouch) but their actual inventory did not contain such a
battery.  They were apologetic.  (They also have battery disposal/recycling
bins, which is good to know.)</p>
 
<p>At this point, we cut our losses and went home.  Six locations, three goals,
zero progress.</p>

<a name="31-07-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#31-07-2009">July 31, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Yesterday, twitter linked me to two articles.  The
<a href=http://usedbooksblog.com/blog/borders-non-blogging-contract/>first</a>
was about how Borders is forcing its employess to sign updated contracts
forbidding them to blog.  The
<a href=http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/press_releases/2009_july_27_wi_fi.html>second</a> was about Barnes and Noble offering free Wi-fi in all its
locations.  I find the juxtaposition interesting.</p>

<p>Fade thinks that the reason Borders has been imploding is because they
lost their focus on books years ago by distracting themselves with music,
and drove their book customers away.  The rest of their flailing merely adds
insult to injury.  I personally see a pattern of pervasive stupidity, but
then my friend Chip back in New Jersey used to work at a Borders and he
was amazed they'd survived as long as they had.</p>

<p>Aubrey's surgery went ok, she should be ready to go home around 6:30 or
so.  (It's a 24 hour vet, so we can pick her up any time after that.)</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>Trying to associate my cell phone with my new bluetooth adapter.  (Lost the
old one, went to Fry's a day or two back to get a new one.)
Hitting the "oh wow Ubuntu's bluetooth support sucks" event horizon again.</p>

<p>Attempt 1: it saw my cell phone, associated, but couldn't talk to the modem.
Went into my phone and told it to forget all the old devices.  Attempt 2
saw a half-dozen other devices in the area, but not my phone.  Obviously it
needed to re-assocate with the phone, but the laptop thought it already was
associated and the phone wasn't.  Went in to the bluetooth GUI and found where
the device association list was (this is progress; the Gnome and KDE guis for
this didn't have such a list I could ever find), removed it, went back and ran
the association wizard again: and now it's seeing no devices.  Unplugged and
re-plugged the USB bluetooth thingy, still seeing no devices.  (No
indication that it's scanning for them, no progress indicator, just a window
that previously, after I let it sit for a while, had stuff magically appear
in it.  Now nothing is magically appearing in it.)</p>

<p>Let it sit there for five minutes, nothing appeared.  I don't think it's
scanning.</p>

<p>I need a mac.</p>

<p>Ah, if "visibility" is on in the laptop, it can't scan for devices.
That's kind of stupid.  Ok, now it's found the phone again, re-associated with
it, and there's no old one of the same name to confuse things.  So, only
about three attempts to make it work, that's greatly improved, it merely
sucks now.</p>
</span>

<a name="30-07-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#30-07-2009">July 30, 2009</a></h2>
<span id=programming>
<p>The text mode dvd install went without a hitch.  So the older
infrastructure left over from the days before Red Hat spun off Fedora works
fine, and the shiny new livecd which is the only thing the fedora project
points you at doesn't work at all.</p>

<p>I note that the text mode install never let me set the system name or
select packages to install, so it's lost some functionality since the old
days, but oh well.  It gave me something that boots.  This is progress.</p>

<p>The Fedora 11 boot has three overlapping progress bars, presumably because
it made the boot asynchronous to try to make it suck less.  (Rather than
trimming out gobs of unnecessary stuff, run 'em in the background.  Then
block and wait for them to finish.  Right.)</p>

<p>The sad part is that all three progress bars have hit the right edge
after 58 seconds, at which point the install sits there for multiple
minutes, unchanging, before suddenly resizing the window to go into graphics
mode and start bringing up X11 and the desktop.  (Well, that's what the
livecd does, the disk install is giving me a text mode login: prompt.)</p>

<p>Why even _have_ a progress bar that's spends more time waiting at "done"
than it did advancing?  Rehan showed me that you can hit escape here to
replace the progress bar with the older list of unnecessary things Fedora is
actually doing, such as launching exim, complaining about the "system message
bus", setting firewall rules...  So once again they've replaced
"ugly and overcomplicated but functional" with "pretty, hides the complication
without actually removing any of it, does not actually work".</p>

<p>Anyway, I have an installed system.  Login as root and see what's
installed:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# gcc
-bash: gcc: command not found
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not.  That would have been too easy.</p>

<p>Wow, I'd forgotten how utterly crappy installing rpms from an iso actually
was.  It doesn't autoresolve dependencies, it says things like:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
error: Failed dependencies:
	kerhel-headers is needed by glibc-headers-2.10.1-2.i586
	kernel-headers >= 2.2.1 is needed by glibc-headers-2.10.1-2.i586
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>And then you just add more and more stuff to the rpm -i command line until
it stops complaining.  Each new thing you add has its own dependencies, which
it'll complain about, and eventually, without warning, the whole mess will
either just install or die with some strange internal error.</p>

<p>Luckily I remember from my Red Hat days (which ended back around 2003)
that the naming is pretty consistent.  For non-lib packages use
kernel-headers-[tab], and for library packages strip off the lib, use the
library name, add a dash, and tab complete.  (Doesn't _always_ work, but
it's a good first guess.</p>

<p>I have no idea why it's complaining about:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
warning: gcc-4.4.0-4.i586.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA256 signature: NOKEY, key ID d22e77f2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It's both complaining there's no key, and giving a key id?  Um...  Ok.
(Only package it has problems with, and this is Red Hat's own DVD iso.
Oh well.  It's not like I'm trying to use this thing long-term, just
reproduce a bug with it.)</p>

<p>Heh, I note after all those insanely verbose init scripts, it didn't bother
to run "dhclient eth0".  But it set up exim by default (I vaguely recall
that's an email server or something).  Ok, stop making fun of the insane
defaults, point established, moving on...</p>

<p>Installed gcc and binutils (which sucked in a dozen other packages).
Installed wget.  Ooh, Red Hat hasn't got "which", and my scripts react
badly to that lack.  (Dumped symlinks to "as" and such all over the
current directory, that's bad.  It didn't abort the script because the call
to which was embedded in a "$(blah)" string, so it didn't set an error code
I could test for.)  Maybe I can move the busybox build up so which is already
there?  (Presumably they test on Fedora already...)  Of course I need to
install "make" before busybox will build...</p>

<p>Huh, that could explain the bug Rehan is seeing.  The symlinks to the
host toolchain were missing and the build didn't abort, so once it adjusts
the $PATH to exclude the host tools the compiler isn't there, and thus
can't make executables...</p>

<p>Yup, that's it.</p>
</span>

<p>Unfortunately, Aubrey's 4pm trip to the vet to get the lump on the back
of her neck checked involved the words "malignant", "aggressive", and
at 7am tomorrow will involve the word "surgery".  I'm still hoping to avoid
the word "metasticize".</p>

<p>Not really in a programming mood this evening.</p>

<a name="29-07-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#29-07-2009">July 29, 2009</a></h2>
<span id=programming>
<p>So Rehan Khan posted a bug report to the FWL mailing list, which boils
down to host-tools.sh failing under Fedora 11 because the distcc ./configure
stage says gcc can't build usable executables (even though we're using the
host toolchain at that point).  I haven't used Fedora in years, so my first
step trying to reproduce this is to install Fedora 11 under qemu.</p>

<p>Got Rehan on irc and confirmed that it's the 32-bit version, which
is the only obvious option get.fedora.com seems to offer anyway.  A livecd
that acts as an installer.  Ok, download that and fire it up under qemu.</p>

<p>Booting Fedora from the livecd takes about 7 minutes to give me a
desktop.  If you press escape you can watch it slowly set up LVM and user
quotas, oblivious to being a livecd where such things are hilariously
inappropriate.  You can also watch the init scripts fire up the CUPS
network printer daemon and NFS and so on, when the association with the
wireless network is done by a GUI desktop app these days so it's launching
servers before it has a network.  This is a distro that clearly can't
decide what it wants to be, so it tries to do everything, at once, very
slowly.</p>

<p>Once you've got a desktop, you can double click on the installer whereupon
it takes about 5 minutes to grind through painfully slow dialogs to the point
it gives you a page which doesn't explicitly tell you it didn't find any hard
drives, it just shows you an empty list and asks you to select from it.  Some
of the selections are what to _do_ with the nonexistent drive, such as "use
entire drive", "replace existing linux install", "use free space", and so on.
Note that you specify what to do with the drive before you select the drive to
do it with, to add an extra little bit of confusion when the drive list is
empty.</p>

<p>The reason it didn't find any drives is due to a qemu bug: current qemu-git
only notices the first drive listed on the command line, and installing an OS
requires both an -cdrom and an -hda argument.  I git bisected it to
9dfd7c7a00dd within the qemu repository, mentioned it on the qemu list, and
got pointed at <a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2009-07/msg02221.html>a fix</a>.
This was quick and relatively painless, if I put the -hda before the -cdrom
it either fires up the bootloader or it doesn't seconds after launching qemu,
so reproducing is easy.  And if you build qemu with
./configure --target-list=i386-softmmu it doesn't take very long, and you
can even run ~/qemu/git/i386-softmmu/qemu without installing it first.</p>

<p>The next bug is that Fedora 11's mouse pointer wouldn't move in the current
version, but in the one I booted earlier it did.  I naturally assumed it
was another qemu bug, but this was slow to bisect because it only shows
on the desktop, so the test takes longer than the compile.
Nevertheless, I very slowly bisected that one to a revision
that couldn't possibly affect it (renaming a config symbol), and on a hunch
booted the same qemu version three times and got the mouse frozen twice and
working just fine the third time.  So it's probably not a qemu bug, it's a
Fedora bug.  Of course.</p>

<p>It's not the only Fedora bug.  Fedora seems to be constructed entirely
out of bugs.  Attempting to install Fedora from the livecd is an
exercise in frustration.  What a piece of garbage.  I started with a 1
gigabyte virtual drive, and it complained it needed 3072 megs to install.
Ok, make a 4 gig disk image (dd if=/dev/zero of=fedora-11.img bs=1M count=1
seek=4095) and reboot (7 more minutes, plus 5 to get back
through the installer)... and the auto-partitioning ate itself.  I think
it wanted to create a swap file bigger than a gigabyte, when I was already
feeding qemu 512 megs of ram to make sure it wouldn't have problems without
_any_ swap.  (For comparison, I first booted Red Hat 5.2 with 16 megs of ram.
It ran fine.)</p>

<p>Checking the checkbox that I want to review and edit the partition
layout apparently does nothing, you have to select custom partition layout
from the pulldown.  Ok, do that, new partition, mount at /, the default
filesystem to format it with comes up as ext4 (huh, that's new) so accept
that, hit next... and half a minute later I get a pop-up saying that the boot
partition can't be ext4.  (On irc, Rehan says grub doesn't support it yet.)
Ok, back up, go through it again selecting ext3 this time, save it... and
now it says that the root partition must match the "install image" type,
which is ext4.</p>

<p>I hate Fedora.</p>

<p>Ok, presumably the "boot partition" above is /boot, and the root partition
is /, so I need to make two partitions and format them with different
filesystems to humor the hideously overcomplicated Fedora 11 installer.
Go through the custom partition gui, make a /dev/sda1 that's 200 megs and
ext3 and mounted as /boot, make a /dev/sda2 that's the rest of the space and
ext4 and mounted as /, hit next, tell the stupid pop-up that I know I haven't
got swap and I'm ok with this, tell the second pop-up that if I didn't want
to write the partition layout to disk I wouldn't have hit "next"...  It
grinds for a bit... And it pops up an error message saying it couldn't
save the partition layout.  There's a "details" pulldown which says...
that it couldn't save.  The details provide no additional details.  Great.</p>

<p>Ok, fire up a terminal window, become root (sudo /bin/bash doesn't work
but su - does), run fdisk /dev/sda...  It's managed to save the first
partition but not the second.  How do you do that, I created two primary
partitions and the primary partition layout is a single structure in the boot
sector of the hard drive!  It's less than 100 bytes for all four of them
combined, how do you get something that small _partially_ wrong?</p>

<p>Ok, kill the installer, use fdisk to create the partitions by hand,
fire up the installer again, 5 more minutes of grinding, tell to use the
existing partitions but format and mount each one appropriately.  Re-confirm
the various nanny dialogs (wow the Fedora UI is fond of pop-up dialogs)...
Yay, it's started formatting.  Five minutes later it's still formatting.
Fifteen minutes later, it's still formatting.  This is the 200 megabyte
ext3 partition, even under qemu it should take _maybe_ 10 seconds to
format.</p>

<p>Let's go back to that root window and run "top".  That says 83% of the
Fedora system CPU is beign consumed by "user", and the biggest user is
X11 with 4%, and just about everything else is idle.  Lemme guess, selinux
is enabled, isn't it?  Of course it is, this is Fedora.  So root is even more
crippled than a normal user.  (Top doesn't show any processes that don't
belong to root, because selinux won't let it see them.  Isn't that
special?)  Ok, new tab running as the install guest user, run top in
that, and that can still see all those root processes but now top's fourth
and fifth processes are running as the install user... and they're gnome
infrastructure crap using about 1% of the cpu each at the moment.  What's
eating 80% of the cpu?  Top can't see it.</p>

<p>Right, run ps and look at the list.  There is a mke2fs process, which is
a zombie.  Is the formatting progress bar still there?  Yup.  Check again,
the zombie is still there.</p>

<p>I hate Fedora.</p>

<p>Ok, kill the installer AGAIN.  Format the partitions by hand with mkfs.ext3
and mkfs.ext4 (takes about five seconds each)...  And the gnome automounter
pops up filesystem browser windows for them!  I didn't ask for this,
go away!  Umount!  Right.</p>

<p>On irc, Rehan points out a Fedora bug where certain types of video cards
would cause the installer to hang while formatting drives.  I stop to boggle
at how do you get _that_ wrong?  The video card is a piece of hardware the X11
server talks to, the install program is an x11 client.  They're separate
programs talking to each other through a library API.  And the format itself
is a child process of the X11 client.  How do you build in an incestuous
relationship which would _allow_ that to fail?  The level of incompetence
require to tangle that together and leak information between the two of them
so a video card screws up your ability to format a hard disk is just AWE
inspiring.</p>

<p>Ahem.  Re-run the installer YET AGAIN.  (By my count, this is the 13th
time.  Maybe it'll be lucky.)  By about time 8 I was tempted to skimp on some
of the details, such as setting the timezone to Chicago (there's no Austin
setting) and leaving system name as localhost.localdesktop instead of
"tiffanyhat" (what better name for a nonexistent Fedora system than Tiffany
Aching's virtual witch hat from Wee Free Men/Hat Full of Sky?), but I fill
it all out anyway YET AGAIN despite the incredible slowness of this GUI.
(Qemu was fast enough to play "Frozen Penguin" under using a knoppix boot disk
back in 2005 on my previous laptop.  But it's not fast enough to comfortably
navigate window dialogs Fedora 11 running on a system that's more than twice
as fast and feeding the emulator 4 times as much memory.  Hands up everybody
who considers Fedora 11 an improvement over 2005-era Knoppix?)</p>

<p>At this point, the installer is no longer partitioning, because it
can't competently do that.  The installer is no longer formatting, because
it can't competently do that either.  (Here's hoping it can copy files!
And install the bootloader, because I haven't installed grub by hand in
a couple years and don't look forward to looking up how to do that again.)
I still have to go into the manual partitioning thingy and tell it where to
mount each partition, but I'm NOT MAKING ANY CHANGES so hopefully it...
of course pops up a dialog warning me that it's saving the changes I didn't
make.  It's Fedora.</p>

<p>Yay, it's copying files!  Leave it to that while watching "The Daily Show"
webcast... And it died with another pop-up window.  What this time?  Couldn't
mount /boot.  It copied the files into root, and it couldn't mount /boot.
The details say the reason was "input/output error".</p>

<p>Deep breaths.  Deep breaths.</p>

<p>Rehan suggests yet again I use VirtualBox.  This is A) not the problem,
B) not happening.  I'm not going to swap an emulator I'm familiar with (and
can actually fix or get help with if something goes wrong) for one I've
never used.  Fedora has BOOTED TO THE DESKTOP with the livecd under qemu, if
something was significantly wrong with the emulation that would have
caused problems.  No, these are Fedora bugs I'm hitting, switching emulators
won't help.</p>

<p>Ok, screw this.  The fedora install is too brittle to manually fiddle
with anything.  Every single step where it actually has to _do_ anything
breaks.  The only codepath that ever got any tested seems to be the fully
automated one, and that needs a disk larger than 4 gigabytes.  Ok.  Kill
qemu, zap the 4 gigabyte Fedora-11.img and create an 8 gigabyte
Fedora-11.img.  (I've got 40 gigs free, and it's a sparse file anyway.)
Reboot (7 minutes), grind through the install to the part about hard drives
(5 minutes), tell it to autopartion and "use entire disk", sit back...</p>

<p>And it's formatting /dev/sda1.  It's been formatting that partition for
15 minutes.  For a variant of "formatting" that does not involve the disk
usage light coming on at any point.  The barber pole
progress bar (no idea how long it'll take, but here's a spinny thing!) keeps
twirling, but nothing is happening.  Been there, done that, not a new bug
at this point.  The autopartitioning codepath _doesn't_work_either_.</p>

<p>At this point, Rehan tells me that he couldn't get the livecd to work and
he installed from the DVD image, using the text mode installer.  Of course
get.fedora.com makes no mention of a DVD iso, but mirrors.kernel.org/fedora
has it if you know to look for it.  Apparently, the DVD has more install
options than the livecd does, and doesn't need to talk to the network while
installing.</p>

tab" from an 80x25 terminal, the new one ain't 80x25.  They're usually more
like 77x21.  (Took me a little while to figure out why terminals were
spontaneously resizing themselves so small that menuconfig would refuse to
run.)</p>

<p>I've mostly stopped noting the random bugs/regressions/UI deficiencies in
Linux/Ubuntu/Xfce anymore.  Yesterday it froze and I had to hard reboot it
and it was just another day.  Windows users don't really comment on it either.
Linux will never have a significant number of nontechnical end users, just a
few holdouts like me remembering the glory days of when it coulda been a
contendah, just like OS/2 or the Amiga.  Linux runs the servers and routers
and so on that Unix has spent the past 40 years running, like Solaris and AIX
and Xenix before it, and the desktop-inclined of us turn our attention to
MacOS X.</p>

<p>Pondering yesterday's chicken-and-egg problem with uClibc, it occurs to me
that the library search paths don't get modified until _after_ the new
compiler gets built.  So currently, building uClibc first doesn't do any good,
the one out of the supplied compiler toolchain is the one getting used.</p>

<p>In theory the reason for building it first is because the supplied cross
compiler toolchain could link against a different libc.  But in practice, the
way we redirect the library search paths is to set an environment variable
that points the wrapper script at a different directory, and if the supplied
toolchain isn't using our wrapper script doing that early isn't going to
help.  (Plus I _think_ you can feed it multiple directories with a colon
separated search path, but it's been a while since I tested that.  It needs
to check the new directory and then fall back to the old one, and throwing
canadian cross stuff in here with two compilers, potentially both using
our wrapper script, gets ugly.  I'd need to put the architecture name
in the environment variable name to distinguish between them, and since
you never need to canadian cross to build anything _other_ than a compiler,
I'd rather not add that complexity to the infrastructure for this one case.)</p>

<p>The alternative is to accept that the canadian toolchains we build will be
built with the --disable-shared toolchains we build.  I.E. the uClibc we
build for the canadian toolchain will have the same binary API as the uClibc
in the target toolchain supplied to the canadian build.  That's true now,
and if it becomes an assumption we can _rely_ on, then the uClibc build can
move back to after the binutils/gcc build...</p>

<p>Darn it, except there's NO GUARANTEE THAT NEW TOOLCHAIN RUNS ON THE HOST.
(Whole point of canadian cross.)  So building a new toolchain that's
--enable-shared and thus has soft-float support doesn't help us then build a
uClibc that depends on soft-float, because we can't run it as part of the
build!</p>

<p>I continue to hate the gcc developers.  And cross compiling in general.
I'm motivated to provide a sufficiently generic solution to the cross
compiling problem that it GOES AWAY and nobody has to do any more of it.
I'm aware this is difficult, but cross compiling is an inherently horrible
problem.  I've been doing this for years and the tracking the multiple contexts
still bites me repeatedly during the design phase, especially after a couple
weeks away from the problem space.</p>

<p>Darn it, I know how to do this, and it's a special case.  I don't want
it to be a special case.  Is there any way to make it NOT be a special case?
I want a simple API, insane amounts of granularity, and a calling script
that's simple to the point of being disposable.  These goals conflict a bit.
Hmmm...</p>

<p>Morning rush hour's over, time to hit the road again.  Dallas should be
navigable now.  (Yes, I said that with a straight face, but I'm just trying
to get through it and out the other side.)</p>

<p>Back home.  Dinner with Mark and Fade.  Feeling somewhat unwell now, no
beverages in the house, off to The Donald's for beverage and programming
time.  I should download my mail and a fresh Fedora 11 image to reproduce
that bug report with first...  Ooh, and the <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/newspod>bbc news podcasts</a>.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Firing up Firmware Linux and looking at the code again.  Where did I leave
off?  Fixing armv4l, that's right.</p>

<p>To get armv4 working again (an example soft-float target), I've been poking
at adding the soft float stuff to libc.a like I was doing for 4.1.2.  This
is because gcc only puts soft float support in libgcc_s.so and libgcc_eh.a,
and for some reason it doesn't build libgcc_eh.a for the --disable-shared
version.  Yes gcc is clearly broken, but patching each new version is a pain.
The patch I have for 4.1.2 doesn't apply to 4.2.1, and trying to unwind its
pathological makefiles already ate about three evenings with no obvious
progress.  (Horrible, horrible code.)</p>

<p>I've been looking at genericizing the uClibc miniconfig stuff, comparing
the various target configurations.  The uClibc configurations are mostly
identical, which makes sense since they started out with a single hand-rolled
one and got modified for each target.  However, they do vary a bit.</p>

<p>The i586, i686, and x86_64 targets use the
small MALLOC version, the others use the full one.  The armv4eb target has
UCLIBC_LINUX_MODULE_24 switched off, which is the old 2.4 kernel module
support that doesn't apply to the 2.6 kernel anyway.  The armv5l and armv6l
targets have several additional symbols switched on: DOPIC, LDSO_LDD_SUPPORT,
UCLIBC_HAS_ADVANCED_REALTIME, and DOSTRIP.  Mark added those targets.  And
sparc has FORCE_SHAREABLE_TEXT_SEGMENTS, I remember needing to add that but
forget why.</p>

<p>Other than that, the TARGET_blah symbol for each target (and corresponding
CONFIG_586 and similar sub-symbols), ARCH_WANTS_LITTLE_ENDIAN, and
UCLIBC_HAS_FPU vary per target, as you'd expect them to.</p>

<p>There are also ARCH_HAS_MMU and ARCH_USE_MMU variations per target, which
is weird because none of the targets are NOMMU yet.  Possibly some of that is
miniconfig filtering out symbols that can't be switched _off_ for various
targets, and thus there's no reason to record the symbol because it doesn't
matter for that config.  (I'm not quite sure what the difference between the
two is, actually.  I can understand the kernel caring about the difference
between having an MMU and using it, but I don't think userspace does.
The test/build/check_config_options.sh script has a test "Make sure nothing
uses the ARCH_HAS_MMU option anymore", so apparently USE_MMU is the only one
that matters?  Except it hasn't been removed from current -git...  I'll ask
on the list.)</p>

<p>The actual breakage in FWL is building uClibc in cross-compiler.sh.  Right
after building a --disable-shared compiler, it builds uClibc with that new
compiler so it has a C library to make a toolchain that can build actual
executables.  Building uClibc with a compiler that hasn't got _either_ hard
or soft floating point support breaks, because the uClibc config for each
target enables UCLIBC_HAS_FLOATS (and even DO_C99_MATH), which doesn't work
on a no-FPU platform without soft float.</p>

<p>It looks like the _easy_ way to get armv4 working again is to build a
stripped down uClibc just for the --disable-shared cross compiler, one which
doesn't have floating point support enabled.  If I factor out the
target-specific bits of each uClibc miniconfig and append the generic ones
to them, I can supply a slightly different generic bit based on context,
hence looking at what would be involved in factoring all this stuff out.
Then you can canadian cross an --enable-shared cross compiler right
afterwards, and build the rest of userspace with it.  (This would make
armv4l require the canadian cross toolchain step to build its root filesystem,
but it would avoid patching gcc.)</p>

<p>Darn it, no it wouldn't.  When you're doing the canadian build of the
--enable-shared compiler, it tries to build the uClibc build with the
existing cross compiler, _before_ doing the new --enable-shared gcc build.
(The canadian shared cross commpiler build is based on the root-filesystem.sh
build, not the cross-compiler.sh build.  The sequencing is different and
it builds more stuff.)  It _has_ to do this, so libgcc_s.so has a libc.so.0 to
link against.  So you still need soft float working before you can build
uClibc, and you need uClibc built before you can build the shared compiler,
and soft float is only enabled in the shared compiler.  Throwing in the
canadian cross stuff just makes the dependency _circular_.  Great.</p>

<p>I really, really, really hate the gcc build.  This would be _trivial_
if I could tell it "build libgcc_eh.a but not libgcc_s.so", but of _course_
that's not orthogonal.  Sigh.</p>

<p>I'm at a Chic-fil-a in Kansas City.  It has the same layout as all the
others (so I reliably known where electrical outlets are, and can recharge my
laptop a bit), and due to some promotion they're running they even gave me a
free extra chicken sandwich.  But although there's a linksys router here it's
not actually routing.  Oh well, can't have everything.</p>

<p>Kansas City is actually in Missouri, which is abbriviated "MO".  Presumably
either Michigan, Minnesota, or Mississippi got MI, but using MO for Missouri
seems unfair to Montana.  So far, based on my general experience with Kansas
City (until finding a national chain restaurant I happen to like, anyway),
they should have used "FU" or "NO" as the abbreviation, or perhaps the kind
of punctuation associated with swearing in newspaper comic strips.  It wasn't
rush hour when I arrived in town, but it became rush hour an hour or so
later, while I was still stuck in town, and I'm happily sitting here in this
chick-fil-a waiting for rush hour to subside.</p>

<a name="26-07-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#26-07-2009">July 26, 2009</a></h2>
<p>I meant to leave either last night or this morning, but I wanted to help
my sister clean her apartment first.  (Her kids helped her "unpack" by
dumping the contents of boxes on the floor when she moved in a few weeks
back.)  It's hard to keep _up_ with the mess made by 4 kids, let alone
tackle unpacking, and this weekend her husband had the kids so we could
clean.</p>

<p>Yesterday we both slept late (we needed it), then picked up Ian from his
father's and drove to Minneapolis for the D&amp;D game, and got back late
(it's about an hour and a half each way).  So we didn't get any cleaning
done.</p>

<p>Today, Steve called and said he was having an attack and couldn't take
care of the kids, so Kris had to pick them up around noon.  Shortly after
the breakup Steve's new girlfriend Lara got him to go to the doctor and get
diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (a mostly non-progressive variety of it
that he'll have for life but which is very unlikely to be what kills him
first).  He's also on anti-depressants, so whether it's MS acting up or
depression because his girlfriend is out of town this weekend is an open
question.</p>

<p>The fallback plan if Steve wasn't feeling well had been that he could take
them down to the public pool and watch them while they swam, but he wasn't even
feeling up to that.  Kris had to come rescue him from his kids, so we didn't
get time off to clean.  (Did I mention that if they divorce, he wants custody
of the kids?  They live with their mother almost all the time and he physically
_can't_ watch them even for a weekend, but that doesn't enter into it
apparently.  They didn't even get fed until Kris picked them up at noon.
I told her to email her social worker with today's story.  Steve still doesn't
seem to believe she's going to divorce him.)</p>

<p>Thus my departure was delayed.  In the hour or so we had, I helped Kris
reorganize her storage closet so she can Ebay her sewing pattern collection
for extra money,  then Kris went and picked up the boys (finding
out when she arrived that the kids local grandparents, Steve's parents, had
already come and picked up the girls, who are generally much better behaved
and easier to watch).  Ian went off to his corner with his X-box, and I took
Sean down to the dollar store.</p>

<p>Ian saves money to buy big things, he still has $20 his grandfather gave him
which he was saving towards an Xbox, and is now saving towards Halo 3 if
he can ever convince his mother to let him get a T for Teen game.  Sean
immediately spends any money he gets at the dollar store, and he'd accumulated
$3 in change that was absolutely burning a hole in his pocket and needed to
be spent NOW.  Kris gave me directions to the dollar store we'd been to
earlier in the week (where Carrie got her "Princess" baloon), but Sean
wouldn't drive three blocks without his car seat and it couldn't be installed
in the front seat (the back is full of travel stuff), so he got his bike
and I walked while he rode.  It was good exercise.  Boy am I out of shape.
(A block is a bit longer in New Ulm than in Austin.)</p>

<p>This gave Kris time to clean, and I did what I could to help when we got
back.  The living room floor is now clear, and the hallway to the bedrooms,
which is _progress_.</p>

<p>Finally got on the road at 6:15 pm.  Sean came out to hug me one more time
on the way out.  I love the little... ahem.  I totally don't understand him,
but he's my nephew.</p>

<p>Minnesota is full of corn and soybeans.  The entire state.  The entire
time I was here I saw exactly one wheat field (and it was some kind of dwarf
wheat a foot high but fully ripe and ready to harvest) next to my sister's
public storage unit.  (The big one offsite, not the closet.)  Everything
else: corn and soybeans.</p>

<p>Kris says that the money's in corn, most profit per acre (as cattle feed and
due to really stupid ethanol subsidies), but crop rotation is important and
soybeans are nitrogen fixers so they're the most profitable other crop you
can rotate in.  The entire state appears to be owned by farming congolmerates
that min-max everything.  The munchkin approach to farming.  (Oh, and it's all
genetically engineered stuff with little labels at the edge of the fields
saying what it is.  They come right up to the edge of the road, too.  Not a
square foot wasted.)</p>

<p>The other thing Minnesota is full of is anti-abortion billboards.
Apparently you can't get one around here, but they still feel the need to
rail against it about twice per mile.  (In New Ulm the blonde, blue-eyed
inhabitants also refer to President Obama as "the nigger", which takes rather
a lot of the small-town charm out of the place.  Kris didn't choose to move to
this place, Steve did, and now the kids' friends and school are there.
Sigh.  This is the kind of place Sara Palin and co were attempting to
appeal to.)</p>

<p>Passing the border to "I'm from Iowa, I only work in outer space", and
the terrain suddenly.  Now there's some actual nature mixed in, and crops other
than corn and soybeans.  Still lots of anti-abortion billboards, and ones
claiming to be from God (who buys billboard space, apparently, and needs
that advertising channel to communicate with people).</p>

<p>The "you're about to run out of gas" light came on during a stretch of I-35
surrounded by corn and the smell of cow manure, and I pulled off at the next
exit (something like "Smithville") to find what claimed to be a town but wasn't
really, a mile off the interstate down a small unlit road.  The guy in the
first mobile home I came to ("Nascar fans here", the sign said) said that the
town didn't have its own gas station, and the closest gas was either 15 miles
down I-35 the way I was going or 7 miles back the way I came.  Fifteen seconds
later his brain caught up and he it suddenly occurred to him "or you could use
our gas station", and gave me directions to it along various dirt roads.
I thanked him, and got back in my car.  (Nice guy.  Very polite, in a "yes
officer I am sober" sort of way.)</p>

<p>Said gas station was 5 miles away (in the next town over), the car made it,
I got gas, heaved a huge sign of relief, retraced my steps, and headed back
down I-35 with a full tank.  The next exit along the highway, about 3 miles
into the "15 miles that way", was labeled with the name of the town I'd just
been to, and had a sign for gas of the brand I'd just gotten.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>Found the Iowa "welcome center" sometime later.  It's a little over 1/4 of
the way into the state according to the map, which seems a strange place for
a welcome center but it has wireless internet and an electrical outlet so I'm
not going to quibble.</p>

<a name="25-07-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#25-07-2009">July 25, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Spent most of a week at my sister's new place in Minnesota.  Today's entry
is entirely about that, I haven't seriously poked at any programming things
since leaving Austin.</p>

<p>Due to her impending divorce, my sister recently moved into subsidized
"Section 8" housing (yes I keep thinking Klinger from MASH), and just got
approved for food stamps.  This is my sister.  I need to go back to full-time
work and earn a LOT of money and send it to her.</p>

<p>The backstory is she got postpartum depression after her fourth kid,
and instead of getting her any sort of help her husband found a new girlfriend,
the wife of some guy who's in the military deployed to the middle east.
When Kris (my sister) dug her way out of it (after about a year), she told
Steve (the husband) to break it off, but he wouldn't, so they're separated.</p>

<p>As a stay-at-home mother living in a tiny rural town an hour and a half
from minneapolis, surrounded by Corn and Soybean fields.  Kris' career prospects
kind of suck at the moment, even without the need to take care of 4 kids
into account.</p>

<p>He does not expect her to divorce him, what he really wants is one wife to
take care of his kids and another for fun.  If she does divorce him, he wants
custody of the kids and not to pay any child support.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have two nieces and two newphews, which makes four "relatives
there is no convenient grouping term for".  Kris suggested "Siblings'
offspring".</p>

<p>The oldest is Ian, and the next oldest is Sean, and they have a dynamic
almost identical to me and my younger brother.  Geek vs non-geek.  Except where
I was hyperactive with borderline Aspbergers and went largely undiagnosed and
unmediciated, Ian's probably got full-blown Aspbergers.  (The drugs his
school prescribed made him a zombie, so he's off 'em again.  I tried
caffeinating him, which hits the exact same neuroreceptors as ritalin but
is milder and easier to control the dose.  It seemed to help, but he can taste
caffeine the way I used to smell celery from the next room.  He thinks
chocolate penguin mints are nasty.  During today's D&amp;D 4E game after
about the sixth time the GM reminded him that it wasn't his turn (which
was around the 20th time they asked him to quiet down) I found out he'll drink
black tea with enough sugar.  Admittedly then his system's full of sugar and
the result isn't exactly "calm", but afterwards he became about the third most
frequently admonished of the group of five pre-teens, rather than outdoing
the rest of them combined by about a factor of 2.)</p>

<p>Oddly this makes Ian the newphew I understand the most.  He started my visit
by trying to get me to read a Star Wars expanded universe book, then telling me
at great length about the fanfic he was writing (for a definition of
"writing" that does not involve actually writing any of it down) based on the
video game "Halo".  (Ok, that's an oversimplification: there's a website full
of Halo fanfic which Ian's read all of.  He's writing fanfic for his favorite
stories in that.  So technically, he's writing fanfic for fanfic based on a
highly derivative video game, and it is TOTAL mary sue.)  Then it segued into
the "who would win" questions about his lego fictures recreating various halo
units.  He was jumping up and down in place pretty much the entire time.  That
was just the first hour of my visit.  The bouncing and yelling continued pretty
much constantly for about three days, except when he target locked and paid
such close attention to something (lego catalogs, the eeepc I sent so Kris
would have something to web surf and read email with) you couldn't get his
attention without physically grabbing him.</p>

<p>Ian's 10th birthday is on the 29th, so I got him an Xbox 360 and
<strike>Halo Kitty</strike> "Halo Wars", which is apparently
Command and Conquer with a shorter story but significantly better graphics.
(It's what he wanted.  I feel dirty for voluntarily giving Microsoft money
for the first time since 1992, but oh well.  I note that the Xbox 360 at home
was A) used, B) purchased by Fade not me.  It's a subtle distinction, but
I stand by it.)  Ian mostly spent the rest of my visit playing Halo Wars,
either bouncing up and down in his chair and chanting about what he's was
doing, or target locked so strongly he was barely breathing and didn't
notice the rest of us.  Aah, memories...</p>

<p>Sean I don't understand, but then I didn't understand my brother either.
He's a social butterfly always surrounded by a group of friends, and he
plays sports.  And he seems to be the emotionally neediest of the four by
a large margin.  He's deeply jealous of Ian's Xbox (birthday present status
notwithstanding), and spent the rest of the week either crying about it or
trying to tease Ian with various things he bought at the dollar store.
(Sean's 8th birthday is in November sometime, I'll have to send him something
just to balance the scales.)</p>

<p>Sean doesn't read yet.  He apparently can (at least at the sounding things
out level), he just shows no interest in it.  I need to send him my copies of
Robert Asprin's "Another Fine Myth" series, which are easy reads (ok, total
popcorn: I finished three of them in an afternoon when I first got them, I
think I was about 10) and are what finally got my brother reading for fun.</p>

<p>The next down the list is Carrie, who is 3 but comes across as 5 or 6.
(She's _enormous_ for a 3 year old.  Ian and Sean look a year or two older
than they are but Carrie's twice the size and maturity you'd expect.  She
may grow up to be Sigourney Weaver.)  She wears pink, everything she owns is
pink and half of it proclaims she's a princess (most recently a mylar balloon
she absolutely adores), and she manages to vamp and flirt at age 3.  It's kind
of impressive.  Otherwise, she's a complete tomboy constantly covered with dirt
and engaging in various athletic activities.  So basically, she's a tomboy in
a pink dress that says "princess".  Kris expects Carrie to grow up to own a
pink motorcycle, with pink leathers.  (Possibly an 18th birthday present.)</p>

<p>I tried to spend time with her, but she's the most self-sufficient of the
lot and my newphews outright demanded my attention the whole time.  Sean is
emotionally very needy and Ian's just plain a handful.  And then, of course,
there's the baby, Sam.</p>

<p>Samantha is no longer a baby, and hitting the far end of "toddler", but
this is the first time I've made it up there since she was born.  She's 1
and change (her second birthday's at the end of October I think), but entered
her Terrible Twos shortly before I arrived.  ("Do you want to say no?"  "No!")
She's been speaking in full sentences for months now (although it's hard to
tell sometimes because her pronunciation's on par for her age, not much you
can do about mouth shape).  In general she seems every bit as precocious as
Ian or Carrie, but she didn't remotely trust me until about the third day
so I couldn't tell much about her.  She warmed up to me on the third day
at the park when she brought her half-deflated kickball (it's _her_ ball)
and wanted to be goalie in the little league soccer net while I threw
the ball at her so she could block it.  (Sean insisted she couldn't use
her hands, because it was soccer.  He's 7, she's maybe 1 and 3/4.)</p>

<p>Sean is apparently the least smart of the 4, which makes him about average,
possibly a little above.  Ian is VERY smart and bored out of his skull by
school (which is painfully familiar to me).  Carrie isn't in school yet, but
easily could be.  Sam managed to enter the Terrible Twos several months early,
speaking full sentences and holding reasonably coherent conversations (although
she has to stop and think before answering a lot of questions and you can see
the "wow, I never thought of that!" look go across her face quite
frequently).</p>

<p>This is probably a contributing factor to Sean being... well... like my
brother.  I don't want to say "emotional black hole", because that's not it
and it's pretty much expected of 7 year olds anyway.  He's different from me,
and like my brother: he attracts groups of followers from the local children,
and he picks and chooses who is "in" and who is "out", and they do what _he_
wants to do (which in a couple explicit cases during the week weren't what
they wanted to do, but he won the arguments because his approval was the
goal.)</p>

<p>It's not just that all of Sean's social interactions are amazingly shallow
and petty, either, because he's 7 so that's normal.  Ian's excitement over his
mary sue fanfic is about what you'd expect from a 10 year old ("she has a 100
mile long ship that can blow up ANYTHING... well, except suns and bigger"), and
that doesn't bother me because he's enjoying it and it's a stage you have to go
through to get better at writing anyway.  (I did encourage him to actually
write it down, although that was partly self defense so he'd stop telling me
about it.)</p>

<p>Possibly it's that Ian and Carrie and even Sam have their own little
projects to pursue, but everything Sean does is relative to "beating" other
people.  For example, they all share one computer (the eeepc I sent, although
they may get one of Steve's castoff desktop systems soon).  I got it for Kris,
but Ian tends to spend more time on it than anyone else.  (I meant to teach him
C, but there just wasn't time.)  Sean and Ian share a bedroom (the same way
Carrie and Sam do, it's a 3 bedroom apartment with 5 people in it when I'm
not there.)  The point is, everybody tends to wake up at the same time.</p>

<p>One morning, Sean grabbed the computer as soon as he and his brother got
up.  I noted that Ian had been reading "order of the stick" (a webcomic
I introduced him to the first day), and we'd accidentally lost his place
yesterday, so could he open a new tab?  Sean immediately closed the window and
giggled.  Then he insisted he needed to look something up on Google but
"couldn't remember what", and needed help.  He sat there at the Google screen
for several minutes, holding the computer but not using it, but talking about
how he was using the computer.  He then went to the bathroom as soon as Ian
was done with it, forgetting to take the eeepc with him, and Ian grabbed
the unattended computer off the kitchen table and started going through the
archive to find his lost place.</p>

<p>When Sean got out of the bathroom he threw a screaming fit.  He'd been USING
the computer (even though he hadn't been able to come up with anything
specific to do with it), and Ian taking it away from him was unfair.  So I
offered my laptop to Ian so he could read Order Of the Stick on that, and
gave the eeepc back to Sean.  At which point Sean went into a full blown
crying tantrum, and his mother called him on it: he hadn't wanted the
computer to use it, he'd wanted it to keep it away from Ian, because that
was the way to "beat" him.  When having it didn't stop Ian from web surfing,
he didn't want it anymore.</p>

<p>This was by no means the only example of this, it was just the most
obvious one.  He did it to Carrie too, and it was an important part of the
"in crowd/out crowd" dynamics of his circle of friends.  My guess is that
Sean's real complaint about Ian's Xbox was that it was something Sean couldn't
take away from him.  (During one proto-tantrum I asked Sean if he wanted an
Xbox of his own for his birthday in Novemeber so they could play games through
the network, and he went "Noooooooo!" and started crying because I just didn't
understand how UNFAIR it was that Ian had an Xbox that he wouldn't let Sean
use.)</p>

<p>It's possible Sean will do quite well in life.  I'd point him at a
business degree, and see if he makes it as an executive.  The point is,
I think I understand my other three niecephews, at least well enough to relate
to them, but I just don't understand him.  He's like my brother, the one who
went into sales, which is a profession I also just can't wrap my head around.
(I know what they do, and why, but I've never understood how.)</p>

<p>It is morning, and it is Wisconsin, and I have locked myself out of my
car in yet another McDonald's parking lot.  Waved at my keys in the ignition
so they didn't get lonely.  Called the American Autoduel Association and
they're sending somebody out to let me back in.  Attempting to enjoy a
Sausage Egg and Grease McGristle in the meantime.  I remain confused by the
concept of "hash browns".  Why would anyone do that to a poor defensless
potato?</p>

<p>Ooh, there's internet here!</p>

<p>So not-sword-camp was fun.  (Officially this was the "Summer Weapons
Retreat 2009", since Sal broke up with Heather and took Aegis with him when
he moved out, and Heather's new organization is Polaris.  Remember the
kitten not-george back in Pittsburgh?  Yeah, like that.)</p>

<p>Very long and tiring.  I have many bruises.  It started with a blow to the
head that had me out most of the Wednesday, then I screwed up my right leg on
Thursday by lunging over uneven ground, then I landed on my right wrist on
friday and that was it for the rest of the day, Saturday was sort of cumulative
bruising and fatigue...</p>

<p>I still don't know what to do after legging opponents (getting under the
shield to stab opponents in the leg so they can't stand anymore), but I'm
getting fairly good at that and apparently I flail memorably.  I'm now a danger
to myself and others on the battlefield, which is progress.  (For example, I
got Eric with a beautiful shot to the throat that would have been truly
spectacular if it had been _intentional_, instead of just the result of
keeping my sword between him and me while I retreated wildly and having him
misjudge a flail and walk right into it.  It also would have been caught on
tape if the recorder hadn't been pointing at the other half of the room at
the time, but oh well.)</p>

<p>As far as I can tell I'm at a strange skill level where I'm almost as likely
to take out skilled as unskilled opponents, simply becuase _nobody_ has any
idea what I'm doing, including me.</p>

<p>Camp wrapped up yesterday, and we all saw "Harry Potter and the Half-Caf
double with a twist, flavor shot, and sprinkles", which Fade called "The
Empire Strikes Back" of the series.  (Quite good, not remotely standalone.)
They should probably have split it into two movies, like they're doing with
the last one.  The casting is truly impressive, how could they have known
that Draco would grow up to look like Grand Moff Tarkin's nephew?</p>

<p><a href=http://treebones.livejournal.com>Tracy</a> couldn't make it to the
movie last night because she had to work a night shift, but Fade and I managed
to meet her for breakfast this morning.  She remains quite possibly
the coolest person in the entire state of Michigan.  Then I dropped Fade
off at the airport and started driving west towards my sister's place in
Minnesota.</p>

<p>I type this from a McDonald's in Chicago, largely because I don't
want to go back out and drive through any more of Chicago just now.  (It's 9
pm and it's still rush hour.  That's INSANE.)  I've managed to avoid paying a
toll on any of the roads so far, through sheer peverse determination, but
apparently I have to follow 94 to 41, take that to Rosencrantz, then get on
Guildenstern or something and then some other road I don't remember to bypass
a gratuitous little toll section they put in there JUST TO MESS WITH YOU.</p>

<p>There are six wireless networks visible from this McDonald's, all
requiring WEP keys.  I still haven't found my bluetooth dongle to use my
cell phone internet, and didn't make it to Fry's to buy a new one on the way
out.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Only fired up my laptop twice all week, during the quick trips to Wendy's
when I caught up on twitter and downloaded my email.</p>

<a name="13-07-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#13-07-2009">July 13, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Off to Michigan this morning, so no time for a real blog entry.</p>

<p>Instead, here's the big long rambling stream of consciousness cover letter I
sent to the Google guys in London, just before driving off to be incommunicado
for 3 days.</p>

<p>I resisted, repeatedly, saying "I assume you're going to Google all this
anyway, you being you, but here are a few high points so you don't have to
spend quite so much time fighting off Sturgeon's Law".  It's true, but
apologizing for writing them the cover letter seems counterproductive,
somehow.  Their web form _asked_ for one...</p>

<p>I also tried to resist mentioning that I know it would take twice as long to
edit this mess down into something coherent than it did to write it, but
it's now 5am and I have to hit the road in a few hours.  Coherence is
sort of an optional extra under those conditions.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't really expect them to express any interest, because
Google's contacted me on and off since 1999 but never really seemed to want
to do anything specific.  (Possibly this was because I didn't want to move to
California, which put their recruiters off script.  They also contacted me
maybe three times about a potential Austin Google campus that never
materialized, which is hard to explain as anything other than spite, but
oh well.)</p>

<p>I don't see how me initiating the contact is actually likely to help
matters, but still, it was just an email (ok, web form), I type fast, it would
be fun, and it's not like sending it is worse than not sending it.  Besides,
having recently submitted an Armadillocon proposal bid thingy which (if I can
get the guests I'd be going for, all of whom I've successfully invited to
previous cons) might be able to double their membership in a year, I could
see Google moving me to London instead.  If I'm going to set myself up for
failure, "possibly getting a cool job which would preclude this other
opportunity" seems like the way to go about it.</p>

<p>Yes, I want contradictory things.  What else is new?</p>

<p>Thingy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi, I'd like to work on Google Chrome OS.</p>

<p>I started my professional career working on OS/2 for the PowerPC at IBM, and later did about half the installation software for OS/2 4.0.  Then I bounced off Java (even spending 6 months on a strange JavaOS port to PowerPC at IBM) before switching my system to Linux in 1998.  (Initially I waited for Java to follow me over to Linux, but as I learned more of Sun's internal and external politics I switched to a combination of C, Python, and bash for most of my heavy lifting, with excursions into other languages as necessary.  I really need to get up to speed on Python 3.0, but currently I'm learning Lua instead.)</p>

<p>In the Linux world I wandered into embedded development more or less by accident.  In part it's because I break everything, and wind up debugging down into the low layers of the system anyway.  (It's not just that I've broken simple commands like "echo" and "cat", but I've had other bugs that seemed to be in those commands but turned out to be in procfs and the Linux tty layer and such.  And compiler bugs.  And library bugs.  Among mountains of bugs in my own code, of course.)</p>

<p>I also have a tropism for simple code: I started programming on a commodore 64 when I was 12 and still remember how much you can fit in 38911 basic bytes free.  I don't mind using more, but you should get a decent bang for the byte and most software really doesn't.  After I found out the gnu version of "cat" was 833 lines at the busybox version was 65 (half of which was the license notice), I wound up doing enough work on busybox to accidentally become the project's maintainer for a couple years.  I also extended the sucker to work as part of a development environment, and replaced all the gnu tools of "Linux From Scratch" except the compiler toolchain itself with BusyBox and uClibc.  (The smallest self-bootstrapping Linux system is seven packages: linux, busybox, uClibc, gcc, binutils, gmake, and unfortunately bash 2.x although busybox ash might finally be almost able to replace that now.  Someday I hope to get that down to busybox, uClibc, linux, and probably tinycc, but at least busybox and tinycc need serious work to make that happen.)</p>

<p>What originally attracted me to Chrome was that it was based on webkit,
which was based on the hacked up version of Konqueror that Apple did for
Safari.  Konqueror was my main browser for many years (until I had to leave
KDE behind to avoid KDE 4 a few months ago).  It's about 100k lines of code,
and Firefox is millions.  Even though it's in C++, it's simple.  (Ok, that and the Scott McCloud comic.  I still can't believe the Penguicon 3 guys didn't invite him to be a Guest of Honor after Neil Gaiman recommended our event to him and vice versa.  Sigh.)</p>

<p>I've done lots of other things, I co-founded two different "combination Linux expo and Science Fiction Convention" events (Penguicon and Linucon).  For Linucon I even implemented an online registration system (credit card transactions and a very simple registration database) in python, which might actually be relevant here.  I do most of my cgi in Python give a choice, because filling out a dictionary and then doing sys.stdout.write("""lots of html""" % thedictionary) is just so easy, and I could actually get the web people to look directly at my code without their eyes rolling up into their heads.</p>

<p>I wrote a stock market investment column for The Motley Fool for 3 years, still not entirely sure why.  My favorite series is linked from the end of http://landley.net/writing/ (with a mirror of the rest of the stuff I wrote not very well hidden under there).  I actually enjoy writing documentation.  I am weird.  I have to learn a topic to write about it, and often I write about a topic as I'm learning it by expanding my "notes to self" into a tutorial.  (I then refer to my own tutorial repeatedly.)</p>

<p>I used to teach night courses at the local community college, haven't found the time in a while.  (My retirement plan is to get a graduate degree, make teaching my day job and turn open source programming back into a hobby, although this requires me to get a graduate degree, and returning to ivory tower academia can be a bit of a gear shift after you've been doing it professionally for a while.  Moore's law is often unkind to theoreticians.)  In the meantime I give talks and tutorials at various conferences, some of which have been recorded and put on the web.  I collected the ones I could find at http://landley.net/talks/ .</p>

<p>I've done GUI programming, and admit I miss it a bit.  More than one job of mine involved taking a Dreamweaver mockup page or a hypercard stack of drawings of what java applets should look like, and implementing that.  (Back on OS/2 there were dialog editors, and editing IDL by hand.)  Haven't had time recently, although part of the appeal of Mac and iPhone work would be its GUI nature...</p>

<p>I've been -&gt; &lt;- this close to just giving up and buying a mac for a couple years now, since sometime after I co-authored http://catb.org/esr/writings/world-domination/world-domination-201.html.  (I can even tell you what's wrong with that analysis: the ratio between high and low end of the memory range started stretching around the time of the Celeron back in the mid-90's presumably due to the 56k modem bottleneck, and it continued to stretch until today low end systems have 1/16th the memory of high end ones instead of the 1/4th they had for the first 20 years of the analysis.  I missed that the first time, and it fuzzed up the timing of this transition by over a year.  Eric and I started writing a follow-up paper in 2007 with an updated table, but there didn't seem to be much of a point because nobody'd really listened to the first one and what would they do about it anyway?)</p>

<p>My wife converted to Macintosh rather than Linux, because Ubuntu wasn't a good fit for her and Linux had nothing else on offer.  I'm the one who suggested the Mac laptop, and later bought her the big shiny iMac monolith.  Today I use xubuntu (with XFCE and a drop of Retsin) because KDE 4 was unusable, and a month back on Gnome reminded me why I left it years ago.  But that means I'm using the third most popular desktop on the third most popular OS, which is a rounding error.  As with OS/2 and the Amiga before it, I'm essentially alone in my workstation choice again.</p>

<p>I had such high hopes for Ubuntu, but as with Open Office and Firefox it's spent years struggling to be an also-ran and still doesn't understand _why_.  Death of a thousand cuts, one of the larger ones being that "separating user interface from implementation" and delegating policy to nobody is exactly as much of a virtue as chopping up your kernel into a thousand microkernel processes and hoping you can abstract the hardware away until it disappears.  Sounds great in theory, DOES NOT WORK in practice.  Plus any time "shut up and show me the code" is _not_ the correct response, such as user interface issues reported by nontechnical end users, the open source development process tends to turn on itself and projects fork to death.  Maybe this could be overcome with strong enough leadership from somebody with impeccable aesthetic judgement, but Linus doesn't do UI and Steve Jobs doesn't share.</p>

<p>My current main hobby project (when I'm not wasting time reimplementing various SUSv4 unix command line utilities from scratch, maintaining a compiler fork when I know _nothing_ about compilers, doing weekly summaries of the qemu mailing list when I'm out of my depth there too, and so on) is Firmware Linux.</p>

<p>Technically this means I maintain my own (yet another) Linux distro, and have for a long time now.  (I started writing up the history once, see http://landley.net/code/firmware/history.idx for an unfinished mess, but I didn't expect anyone but me to care.  Yes, computer history is another hobby of mine, see http://landley.net/history/mirror and someday I may write a book on it if I ever get hit by a meteor made out of pure free time.)</p>

<p>But the real point of the project is to make cross compiling go away, by providing a native development environment for various hardware platforms which can then be run under an emulator (such as qemu).</p>

<p>I have a whole talk on why cross compiling A) doesn't scale B) never will, C) is largely unavoidable anyway.  But there are alternatives, and the one I've pursued is doing the absolute minimum amount of cross compiling necessary to bootstrap a native development environment, then running that environment under an emulator.  Instead of cross compiling (with two contexts mixing together and a ./configure stage that asks questions about the host it's building on and uses the answers for the target it's building for which is just conceptually wrong, plus libtool failing to do nothing correctly, plus...), you instead compile natively under emulation where there's just one context.</p>

<p>(To make the speed vaguely feasible, you can then have distcc call out to your cross compiler through the virtual network, moving some of the heavy lifting of compilation outside of the emulator and taking advantage of SMP or even clustering for part of the build, _without_ re-introducing most of the cross compiling complexity to your build process.  But really, just throw hardware at the problem instead of engineering time, an 8-way server with 32 gigs of ram and a raid-0 mirrored terabyte of disk is about $3k these days, or at least that's what my friend Mark paid for ours and that was months ago...)</p>

<p>My friend Mark bootstrapped gentoo inside the native environment, so you can leverage an existing distro package management system if you want.  Mostly a proof of concept so far, although we can scale that up if anybody cares.  I've been mostly focusing on getting an identical environment build for x86, x86-64, arm, mips, powerpc, sh4, sparc, m68k, and all the other targets qemu supports, and then automated regression testing of each new nightly snapshot of linux, busybox, or uClibc on each of those hardware targets.  (Note quite there yet, and more breaks than you'd think, because very few people have these testing environments and those who _do_ use real hardware wired up to lots of serial consoles and a big switch, which is darn expensive and hard to share between multiple developers.  This is a pure software testing environment, anybody can regression test the lot of it on their own laptop.)</p>

<p>Public examples of my code can be found in busybox, toybox, firmware linux, a few quick and dirty build scripts at http://kernel.org/doc/make, and other places.  In the past year I've poked at (and at least submitted bugfixes to) the linux kernel, uClibc, and qemu.  (Probably others too, but that's what comes to mind...)</p>

<p>I'll stop now.  Yay Chrome OS.  Looks like fun.</p>

<p>Attended the Armadillocon concom meeting today.  Dropped off the big
bag of games Fade culled from her collection (which still takes up an entire
bookcase to itself, she mostly got rid of ones she playtested so many times
she's sick of them).  The con suite person wasn't there but I talked to
the guy who was, who might be her brother?  Nothing new there, but I showed
the flag.</p>

<p>Then we went out to a restaurant and they started talking about how
nobody's put in a proposal to chair next year's Armadillocon, and one thing
led to another and I now have about half of such a proposal written up,
with guests to invite and bits of a budget and list of positions that
need to be filled and so on.</p>

<p>This may not be entirely advisable.  (It certainly wouldn't mesh with
spending the next few years in England, although I doubt that will actually
happen...)</p>

<a name="11-07-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#11-07-2009">July 11, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Went to a condo association meeting today.  Apparently, of the twelve
units in the building, one is being foreclosed on (either 103 or 104, I
forget) and two others (102 and 201) are for sale.  The one comparable to my
condo is only going for $119k instead of the $145k these places were going
for two years ago, but it's a weak real estate market and that's
still $30k more than I paid for mine.  (If any developer wanted
to buy the whole building, now would be a good time.  Doubt they will.)</p>

<p>I also have to cough up an extra $800 or so for a "special assessment",
to clean/repair/replace the siding on the building (which was disgraceful
when I moved in back in 2003, and has not improved).  It needs to be done,
but I should really start looking for a new contract when I get back from
Michigan.</p>

<p>Fade rescheduled her flight to be a return flight instead of a flight out,
so I can visit my sister after sword camp instead of before.  This means we
don't leave until monday, so I have today and the weekend to work on stuff,
and can attend all the things scheduled for this weekend.  Yay!</p>

<p>I feel so much less stressed now...</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>The cron job thingy seems to trigger when _any_ unstable package is selected.
The "none" build works fine, but busybox, uClibc, and linux unstable builds all
fail at the same place (binutils getting confused about makeinfo).</p>

<p>This is progress: it means it's not a busybox issue.  (So it's not that
the unstable busybox in build/host is screwing stuff up.)  It also explains
why I've been having trouble reproducing it: it doesn't happen on the first
build.  I have no idea WHY it doesn't happen on the first build, but I
have a new place to look.</p>

<a name="09-07-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#09-07-2009">July 9, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Google is hiring in London, and they're hiring for people to work on
Chrome OS.  This seems interesting, both because I've vaguely wanted to spend
time in England since I first became a Dr. Who fan in the early
80's, and because the OS itself sounds interesting.  I've never particularly
had the patience to jump through Google's various recruiting hoops (such as
when they sprinkled puzzles all around Austin, and Mark solved 'em for fun and
then never applied to the recruiting contact info at the end), but I admit this
is tempting, and apparently just requires a resume.</p>

<p>That said, I didn't send them a resume because I have to go drive up to
Minnesota when they'd be replying.  Fade doesn't want to visit my sister after
sword camp, so I have to do it now.</p>

<p>I also really wanted to go to the Condo association
meeting on Saturday, but I can't.  I was traveling last time they had one,
too.  I haven't been able to go to a condo association meeting since before
we got back from Pittsburgh.  The signs giving the towing information
for the parking spaces got grafitti'd in the past couple days, one of them
is wrenched off the wall and in the flower bed.  It might also be nice to
ask them about the constant 3am pool parties that have been keeping Fade
awake.  But I can't, as I won't be here.</p>

<p>I can't go to the Armadillocon meeting on Sunday either.  This is the
first one I've known about since I tried to get involved again.  I could talk
to the programming guy, talk to the con suite guy I've volunteered to help
out, drop off that big bag of games Fade culled form her collection, and
generally meet the concom.  This is the last meeting before the actual
convention.  Oh well, maybe next year.</p>

<p>Mark and I supposedly hear back about the Linux plumber's conference
talk proposals on the 15th, and presumably he'll phone me if there's anything
I need to do because I'll be on the road.  I can't get the smashed taillight
fixed on the car before I leave, because they have to order the part...</p>

<p>It's gone beyond bad timing into crit-fail timing.  Getting a bit stressed
about it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don't know why it's having this problem.  It only crops up with the
alt-busybox build, not with stable busybox, but when I run the alt-busybox
build on my laptop, or from the command line as my normal user on
securitybreach, it doesn't reproduce.</p>

<p>It's not a specific version of busybox-git with a transient error,
because it's happened three nights in a row.  It's not something to do with
gentoo because the one without alt-busybox builds fine.  It might have
something to do with being the second build to run (after the build with
all stable packages), but I don't see how since I move the build directory
to triage.$STAGENAME after copying out the needed stuff so any leftover debris
from a previous build would be in an entirely different directory (and the
build does an rm -rf on the temp directories anyway).  It might have
something to do with running from cron context, since it's not happening
when I run it from the command line, but what would that be, tty initialization
causing a busybox command to abort?  Seems unlikely.</p>

<p.These things are so much easier to fix when you can easily reproduce them.
Right now, "it didn't reproduce" does not mean "I fixed it".</p>

<p>Sigh.  I have to head to my sister's soon.  No way I'm getting a FWL
release out before then, and my next two weeks are spoken for.  This
entire trip has utterly horrible timing.</p>

<p>I can't even debug it from the road because I can't find my bluetooth
USB dongle, so can't use my cell phone internet.  And of course this problem
only manifests on the server, not on my laptop...</p>

<p>Went to Mark's yesterday and got the cron jobs working.  Only the "build
all stable packages with the most recent scritps" build is doing anything
useful, the unstable busybox, linux, and uClibc builds are all horked for
various reasons.  Need to fix that.</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>Being upset at XFCE because middle-click on a Terminal tab closes it,
and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop that.  My laptop has two mouse
buttons and hitting them both at the same time emulates middle click, but
they're right next to each other and meant to be hit with the thumb so
accidentally clicking both happens a lot, such as when I'm trying to switch
tabs and accidentally close the tab I'm trying to switch to instead.  I
want it to stop.  It never occurred to the XFCE designers that this might
be a problem.  (Or the Mozilla designers either.  There's already a little
"X" icon on every tab to close it, but they had to make another "kill
my program with no warning" option.  That's just brilliant.)</p>

<p>I think this might be a window manager option, except the window manager
thing only lets you change keyboard shortcuts, and specify what double-click
does.  It won't let you specify what anything _else_ does.</p>

<p>It's very Unixy that even after fifteen minutes of Googling I still can't
figure out whether fixing this problem would require a change to X11, to the
window manager, to the desktop program, to the actual Terminal program, or
whether it's controlled by something else entirely like the touchpad
driver or something.  "Delegate it until it goes away" is still the Linux
desktop motto, and I still need to buy a mac.</p>

<p>For some inexplicable reason, the busybox developers reverted netcat
to the old upstream version in 2007.  This means that -f went away,
-l no longer announces its dynamically allocated port number, and so on.
No idea why they did this, but my plans to switch from using toybox netcat
to busybox netcat have been derailed by the fact that busybox netcat can't
do the "tar c blah | netcat $(netcat -l tar x)" trick anymore.  They broke
it for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>As <a href=http://twitter.com/alyankovic/status/2479771164>Weird Al said</a>,
Happy Fifth of July!</p>

<p>Yesterday the fraternity across the street was having a big party, lots
of splashing and girls screaming (they've either installed a pool or a slip
and slide behind their fence), with an enthusiastic but somewhat off-key band
doing covers of songs like "Sweet Home Alabama".  The frat guys regularly broke
out into chants of "USA, USA", which is not actually normal behavior even for
them.  (Ordinarily it's "CHUG, CHUG"...)  Fade and I didn't immediately figure
out why they were doing that, because we'd honestly forgotten what holiday
it was.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Busy night last night.  I was up until almost 6am, and didn't get up again
until 1:30.  But I got a lot of work done, and it's mostly working.  And now
I've got to disentangle it so I can check it in.</p>

<p>The overall point of the changes is to update build.sh so it can do static
cross and native compilers via canadian cross.  Previously buildall.sh
could do that, but build.sh couldn't, which was wrong because really
buildall.sh should be calling build.sh.  (Implementing two versions of the
same thing in two different places is wrong because it's unnecessarily
complex, but it's sometimes hard to figure out how to simplify it.)</p>

<p>So once this is in, you should be able to do:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>STATIC_CROSS_COMPILER_HOST=i686 ./build.sh i686</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or even:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>./build.sh i686 && STATIC_CROSS_COMPILER_HOST=i686 ./build.sh powerpc</p>

<p>So all ./buildall.sh has to do is call ./build.sh for the host first
(i686 or x86_64, or heck if you really _are_ building on a powerpc host...)
And then do the FORK=1 thing to build for all the _other_ non-hw targets
in parallel, and then build the -hw targets.</p>

<p>But the changes to build.sh are the _last_ checkin in the series.  The
other stuff is infrastructure changes to prepare for that.  So what comes
first:</p>

<p>Lots of the work was to teach the various build stages to use $STAGE_NAME as
the target directory for the build.  (Mostly root-filesystem.sh, which gets
called repeatedly to create the static and native compilers as well as the root
filesystem.  Also update check_for_base_arch and create_stage_tarball to use
STAGE_NAME for the tarballs, and change the === announcement lines to use
STAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>I also taught root-filesystem.sh to check for both prerequisite compilers
for the canadian cross stuff.</p>

<p>I removed the NATIVE_TOOLDIRS and /tools support, because it's just not
being used (and updating it for the rest of this is too fiddly).  The isolation
purpose it serves for Linux From Scratch is done by host-tools.sh here, so
it's somewhat redundant.  I replaced it with a ROOT_NODIRS flag that just
controls whether or not to create the full set of directories (/usr, /tmp,
/etc, /mnt, /home, /proc, /sys, and so on), or just let the install create
what's actually used and leave the rest out.  (Disabling that behavior
is good when canadian crossing the static compilers, the result is simpler.
The compiler directory doesn't have to pretend to be a complete root
filesystem.)</p>

<p>The changes to buildall.sh and smoketest-all.sh are still underway.
(By the way, one of those files having a dash and the other not having a dash
is ugly, but I'll worry about it later.)  I broke up the old doforklog
so the forking and the logging behavior are orthogonal.  Added a maybe_fork to
functions.sh, and a maybe_quiet that you pipe the output through to filter
out everything but the === lines.  (Alas, this bit's still fiddly because I
want to log the output _before_ maybe_quiet, but that's just getting the
sequencing right: tee to the log first, then pipe the output to
maybe_quiet.)</p>

<p>Rushing to get this done before heading to Mark's, so I can get the
cron job installed.  (Step 1 is moving it over to the nightly.sh user
so I have a clean environment with a known hook I can hang functionality
on...)</p>

<p>The main reason buildall.sh isn't calling build.sh directly is that
doing the canadian cross stuff has prerequisites that need to be completed
before later stages can continue.  Specifically, the two source toolchains
(host and target) before you can canadian cross a static uClibc toolchain.</p>

<p>However, one possible way around that is to call build.sh for the host
first, and then call build.sh for all the other targets afterwards.</p>

<p>Passed a dozen or so college students setting off firecrackers.  They
gave me one.  Fun.  (I meant to go down to Zilker Park to watch the
big fireworks, but I thought it was starting at 9:30 instead of 9:00,
and then I thought it was only a half hour instead of an hour.  Should
have just gone.  Oh well.  Next year.)</p>

<p>Note to self: using the "spray" instead of "stream" option on the
paint stripper squirt bottle is a bad thing when standing in a niche
with a lot of wind.  That stuff _stings_.  On the bright side, I got
the graffiti outside the window at Lava Java mostly removed.  Ran out
before I could quite get it all.</p>

<p>Biking to Whataburger late in the evening, I passed an impressive
broken water main (North loop just east of Lamar) with two 10 foot long
cracks with water shooting up in inch-high fountains.  Stayed until the fire
truck arrived.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Redoing build.sh to integrate the extra features buildall.sh had.
I've wanted to do this all along, just couldn't figure out how at first.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, doing this has triggered a largeish untangling of
things like NATIVE_TOOLSDIR.  Right now's a fairly bad time to do this,
of course, because I'm meeting Mark tomorrow to get the cron job stuff
installed and I have to drive up to Minnesota on the 8th (although there's
a homeowner's meeting on the 11th...  Timing.  Grrr.  I couldn't go to the
LAST one because I was out of town too.  Highly tempted to just bump the
visit to my sister to after sword camp instead of before it, but then I'd
be dragging Fade along because she's flying up and driving back with me...)</p>

<p>Ok: combine $CROSS and $NATIVE_ROOT into STAGE_DIR.  Make cross-compiler.sh
and root-filesystem.sh use it.  Then decouple the two things NATIVE_TOOLSDIR
is doing: moving the top level directory into a subdirectory (changing the
dynamic linker path and such), and populating a full set of directories
(etc, tmp, proc, sys, home...)</p>

<p>What I really need for the static cross compiler is to not do _either_
of those things.  No full set of directories, and no relocating the top
level directory either.</p>

<p>Ok, replace NATIVE_TOOLSDIR with ROOT_TOPDIR and ROOT_NODIRS.  Replace
$TOOLS with ROOT_OUTPUT...  Sigh.  Do I really want to keep the old Linux
From Scratch /tools directory support?  If you really want one of those,
you can build it yourself.  And if you do a static busybox and static
toolchain, you can move it anywhere you like.  (Well, modulo the boot
scripts saying #!/bin/bash instead of #!/tools/bin/bash...)</p>

<p>AAAAAH!  CRAPECTOMY TIME!</p>

<p>Possily ripping out more functionality than I really should, but it got
too complicated.  I want simple.  (You can tell it's 4am, can't you?

<p>This episode of Bleach is trying to be comedy, and none of the cultural
references translate unless you're japanese.  I can tell they're parodying
specific things, just not what.  The entire episode is designed to be an
aside and not affect the main plot at all.  (I think it's a special for
their 50th episode.)</p>

<p>Hmmm, episode 52 introduced new credits again.  Ah, "if you continue
you may die before you reach $PLOTPOINT".  It's Ichigo being addressed.
Hands up everybody who remembers his limit break.</p>

<p>Ooh, did red haired guy pick up Ichigo's limit break?  Nope, apparently
not...  Ah, I see, he's channeling Ichigo.  Well, that works.  No, it didn't.

<span id=programming>
<p>So where did I leave off yesterday?  I found out that the reason the
"FORK=1 ./smoketest-all.sh" script was failing was that formatting a dozen
virtual partitions (to create the "hdb" images to mount on /home inside each
qemu instance) was causing so much I/O contention that the timeout
was elapsing before any of the actual tests could even start.  At a guess,
mke2fs has some fsync() calls in there, and having an 8-way server with 32
gigs of ram doesn't help if flushing to disk is the bottleneck.</p>

<p>The easy way to deal with this is to add an option to _not_ create the
hdb images, because in this case they're not needed...  Ok, done.</p>

<p>On an unrelated technical note, I wonder how close wifi is to taking over?
Nobody offers ethernet jacks you can plug your laptop into anymore.  (Well, a
few hotels and such have them left over, but nobody's installing new ones in
public places.)  Homes wired up for ethernet don't seem all that common either,
most people just get a wireless router, plonk it next to their cable modem, and
call it a day.  They don't bother running cat5 through the walls.</p>

<p>But offices are still full of ethernet.  Servers need the bandwidth
(both for raw speed terms and for density).  Wireless is also less attractive
when you're worried about security.</p>

<p>But the question is, where does the money go?  Who buys so much of
a technology that it becomes a ubiquitous dirt cheap commodity?
I don't have enough information to know what the financial incentives
are for upcoming generations of technology.  The existing wired stuff is
already amortized: 10baseT is essentially disposable, 100baseT is dirt cheap,
and Gigabit is less than a dollar per device.  There's 10 gigabit in the wild,
I haven't really heard much about it in the past couple years but I assume it's
still doing its thing.</p>

<p>Usually I can predict where a technology is going over the next few years,
but here it just hasn't come up in a while.  I haven't seen a lot of demand.
For normal consumer use 802.11g (54 megabits/second) is fast enough for half
a dozen people to watch HDTV resolution video simultaneously, and that seems
to be about where demand stops at the moment.  It's "good enough".</p>

<p>Gigabit ethernet is a little over 100 megabytes per second.  My laptop hard
drive is doing about 60 megabytes/second.  So the cheap wired consumer
networking is faster than cheap consumer storage devices, and although you
can get a RAID NAS cheap these days, it'll be a while before anybody outside
of a data center can really make use of 10Gig ethernet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I vaguely recall 802.11g is 54 megabits/second, which is a bit
more than 6 megabytes per second, although possibly a router retransmitting it
in between means half of it's devoted to sending it to the router and half of
it's devoted to receiving it from the router; it should be possible to send
it point to point but I dunno if that's what normally happens.  I should
run some benchmarks...</p>

<p>On the one hand, my laptop hard drive is almost 10 times as fast as the
theoretical maximum of 802.11g.  On the other hand, my extra-fast cable
modem (for which I pay extra) maxes out at a megabyte and change per second,
so the wireless is at least 3 times faster than that.  So it's a bottleneck
going between two local computers, but not going to the internet.</p>

<p>The upcoming 802.11n standard claims to be 600 megabits/second, with
typical throughput around 144 megabits/second.  (That's from wikipedia so
take it with a grain of salt.)  So somewhere between 100baseT and gigabit.</p>

<p>When I was over at Mark's cat-sitting and grabbing the Mythbusters episodes
and kitten porn anime (which has more than one episode devoted to litter box
training) it was only doing a megabyte or two per second.  Downloading a
whole directory of episodes took an hour, while plugging in gigabit ethernet
would have given me up to ten times that speed.  But I just didn't bother
to rustle up a cat 5 cable and find a place to plug it in; I wasn't in enough
of a rush to make it worth the effort.  802.11n would make plugging in
gigabit cat5 even less attractive, although I'd have to buy a new laptop
and a new router to make use of it, and would that come with 10gigE for its
wired option?</p>

<p>My question is, will wired ethernet stop getting sufficient financial
incentives to keep ahead of wireless?  I'm not interested in what you can
do by throwing money at the problem (I could wire up my home with fiber
if that was the case).  Will 10gigE get commoditized to the point it
displaces gigabit the same way 100baseT drove 10baseT to extinction and
gigabit is now doing to 100baseT?  Or will 10gigE remain a premium product
costing extra, and not installed by default in new budget laptops?  In
which case, 802.11n will outcompete gigabit cat5 in just about all
consumer installations.</p>

<p>Dunno.  I haven't got enough information, and am not entirely sure where
to go to look it up...</p>

<p>The xfce terminal program lets you change font size (either with the

<p>I learned a new thing about how shell scripts work!  (Translation, I spent
a couple hours trying to understand a really strange bug that bit me.)</p>

<p>In shell script, a for loop works like:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
for i in one two three
do
  echo $i;
done
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The problem with that is if you want multiple related arguments (for i
in "one 111" "two 222" "three 333"), you have to split them yourself, which
is fiddly.  (You can do it with awk, with cut, and a couple other fiddly
ways that tend to be brittle.</p>

<p>The dirty trick to get around it is to do this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
echo -e "one 111\ntwo 222\nthree 333" | while read one two
do
  echo $one $two
done
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The problem is when you try to set a variable in the loop for use after
the loop, or return from a shell function inside the loop.  The problem is the
second half of the pipe runs in a subshell (it's a separate process), and
the entire body of the loop is considered the second half of the pipe.  So
you're setting variables in the subshell or returning from the subshell, and
that has no affect on the parent process.</p>

<p>That's subtle and fiddly and evil.  I understand why it's doing it,
but it took me by surprise anyway.</p>

<p>Resuming the next morning isn't a whole lot of fun either.  Where did

<p>For bonus points, the squashfs bug occurs intermittently.  I've run a
kernel with it twice and had it run to completion the first time and die with
the squashfs bug the next.  That's going to be fun to track down if 2.6.30

<p>Several people pointed out to me in email that I can go "git archive HEAD"
to export the current version.  The reason that didn't work when I tried it?
Because "head" doesn't work, it must be all upper case, even though "master"
is lower case.  (Yeah, that's git.)</p>

<p>I also read the man page for git bisect.  (git help bisect == man git-bisect,
therefore if the git man pages aren't installed, which they aren't by default,
git has no help.)  Anyway, it turns out there is a way to specify a skip
result from the run script, which is to exit with the magic error code 125.
No rhyme or reason behind it, because this is git, but it's nice that there
is a way.  (I'm still not using it, since it's trivial to do by shell
script.)</p>

<p>The part that isn't trivial is that my script has so far done bad, good,
bad, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip...  It may go through all

<p>Bleach continues to be weird, not that I expected different.
Up to disk 12 now.  Episode
46 was a giant gratuitous flashback for secondary characters, and now 47
is apparently internal politics on the part of the antagonists, and
now we're back to protagonist boy Ichigo dueling with the antropomorphic
personification of his sword. (Yes, really.  While werecat woman
watches.)  Episode 48, more internal politics with long dramatic
swaths of recycled footage and the same three songs, and now the
catgirl is wondering why Ichigo isn't levelling up during training
(because she hasn't pushed him to limit break yet, you've got to beat
him silly before he levels and the current session hasn't even drawn
blood yet).  Well of course they shortened the deadline, that's
plot 101.  And now episode 49, and it's flashback land again.
"Don't worry, it's just a reconnaisance mission".  Oh yeah, to quote

<p>Ok, this bisecting isn't getting anywhere, it's gone through well over
a dozen iterations of skip and every one it looks at still build breaks
with:</p>

<blockquote>

/home/landley/firmware/thingy/build/temp-powerpc/alt-linux/arch/powerpc/include/asm/highmem.h:98: error: implicit declaration of function 'debug_kmap_atomic'
</pre></blockquote>

<p>What I probably need to do
is grab the current revision it's looking at and the last known "bad" one
(which reproduced the error I'm looking for, meaning _this_ error was fixed),
find the fix, make a patch, and bisect between the last known "good" and "bad"
applying the patch to each iteration that's horked by this bug.</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>This brings up another annoyance about git: "good" means the old version for
the bisect and "bad" means the new version.  If you're looking for
where something was _fixed_ so you can apply the patch yourself, you have
to call the broken one "good" and the fixed one "bad", which is not only
really easy to confuse but tends to screw up the next few bisections you do
because you can't what "good" currently means when the definition keeps
changing every couple of searches.  (And if you answer a single
question wrong during a bisect the result is useless.  You have to remember
to test the last one yourself to make sure it reproduces the problem you're
looking for, and test all the parent commits to make sure they don't.)</p>

<p>Since you have to _start_ a bisect with one good and one bad, git should
be able to tell from that which one means "before" and which one means "after".
But that would fall under user interface issue, meaning it's the user's problem.
They give you 160 bit hexadecimal hash codes you can cut and paste from
window to window, that should be enough for anybody, right?  After all,
needing to understand how a piece of software was implemented in order to
use it builds character.  Sigh.</p>

<p>I'm sure at some point in the future the git developers will silently change
all this.  Knowing them, instead of autodetecting before and after they'll add
a --reverse-bad-good flag you have to pass in by hand.  Either way it'll be my
fault for not keeping up with all the random changes they make to the user
interface.</p>
</span>

<p>Anyway, back to _this_ bisection.  I've got the last commit bisect found
that manifests the problem I'm actually interested in, and I can grab any of
the commits it's been stuck on which show the problem I'm _not_ interested
in (but which git bisect skip is too stupid to get past), and then bisect
those two find the patch that _fixed_ it, then apply that patch to re-test
broken versions in the original bisect and hopefully actually make
_progress_.</p>

<p>This is another fun case of "good" and "bad" having to be redefined,
since each is showing a different bug:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
git bisect good 18b41f1cd537168a886c43237297692ba8d0a143 # shows build break
git bisect bad a0e0404fb06164100991cacf8e055f6b30f87cc9 # shows hang
</pre></blockquote>

<p>So here, "good" means "the bug I'm trying to find the fix for in the short
term", and "bad" means "the bug I'm ultimately trying to find a fix for".
Wheee...  I hate git.</p>

<p>And hey, one of the intermediate commits shows the squashfs bug, but
not the build break.  (It's e0cf8f045b2023b0b3f919ee93eb94345f648434 and
yes, that's how git expects you to refer to it.  You can use any arbitrary
consecutive subset of those digits, but assuring you're using enough to
avoid collisions with any of the tens of thousands of other hash codes the
tree is made up from is your problem.)</p>

<p>Anyway, that commit shows _NEITHER_ of the bugs I'm looking for (it
instead shows a third bug unrelated to either do; did I mention that the
general testing level of non-x86 kernels is crap?), and that's progress!
The last "good" showed the build break, so this is after that was fixed.
The last "bad" showed the hang, and this is before
that was introduced.  So depending on what I answer here, I could track
down either the fix for the build break or the introduction fo the hang,
but since what I want is the hang and this proves that it wasn't introduced
in the range of commits covered by the build break, I can answer "good" here
and change what I'm looking for (mid-bisect) to track down that hang!</p>

<p>Did I mention git's user interface sucks rocks and it's essentially
unusable if you don't know how it was implemented?</p>

<p>Bisected a powerpc problem and reported it upstream.  Found out I'd
bisected it wrong, and that the list I was supposed to report it to is
A) not on kernel.org but on ozlabs instead, B) unlisted in their index.</p>

<p>Wrote a script to automate the bisection.  Somebody pointed me that
git's had yet another random feature bolted to the side of it in a
hap-hazard fashion that I might have been able to use instead.  Decided
I didn't care.  (And I decided that _before_ I found out that there's
no way to indicate a "maybe" response to git bisect run, which makes it
kind of useless because I've hit two unrelated bugs already in the bisect.
One build breaks the kernel, the other one screws up squashfs some time
after the root filesystem is mounted.  The one I'm looking for is
distinguishable in the kernel boot messages, before init runs.)</p>

<p>Ok, current Ubuntu's uselessness factor continues to rise.  Attempting
to suspend my laptop, I get the pop-up "Request to
do policy action: multiple applications have stopped the policy action from
taking place.  vlc: Playing some media.  vlc: Playing some media."</p>

<p>First, no running software should be able to the system from suspending.
Second, there are no copies of vlc running anymore, they exited before I
tried to suspend but this status _leaked_.</p>

<p>Right, BIG HAMMER TIME.  Ooh, it' s been a while, what do I need to do...
switch to a text console, become root, "echo -n mem > /sys/power/state"...</p>

<p>Back from suspend.  (It worked.)</p>

<p>Ok, here's my objection.  It's not that the system was just complaining about
nothing, it's that a sus

<p>The status leaking might be because doing something simple like extracting
a linux tarball paralyzes the rest of the system for a minute or more
at a time.  (For example, in the above sentence, vi hung after the "m" in
system and nothing else I typed displayed until the period after "time".  I
could have typed _way_ more in that gap, but I stopped because cursoring back
up to fix typos three sentences back is annoying.)</p>

<p>This means that a bisect script which uses "git archive" to feed a tarball
into my build system can't just run in the background and be ignored, it makes
the rest of the system INSANELY unresponsive.  Firefox also hangs for upwards
of a minute at a time (not only can I not scroll the page, but if I move
another window over it it won't _redraw_).  And it hangs like this about
every 3 minutes.  On a dual core 1.7 ghz laptop with 2 gigabytes of ram.</p>

<p>Yes, the "Linux on the Desktop" people have been trying for 15 years now,
and this is what you've come up with.  Moore's Law says they've now got 2^12th
times as much memory, processor power, and disk space as they started out with
and this is still the best they can do.  (How many years did they waste
insisting that the display driver (X11) needs to run as a normal process so
normal system load can freeze your mouse pointer, making it hard to even
queue up actions for the system to do when it stops playing with itself?)</p>

<p>An invocation I've found useful:</p>

<blockquote>
git archive $(git show | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}') --prefix=linux/ | bzip2 > ~/firmware/thingy/packages/alt-linux-0.tar.bz2

<p>It would of course be nice if "git archive" could just spit out the current version without having to be told what version that _is_, but this is git we're
talking about.  There's probably a way 300 lines into a seemingly unrelated
man page, but you'll never figure it out yourself.</p>

<p>In that way it's very much in the spirit of vi or emacs.  You don't learn
how they work by playing around with it.  You learn by grabbing a

<p>I am way, way, way off a day schedule again.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>The reason powerpc is giving me so much trouble is that too many different
things have changes since the last time I had it working.  The qemu version
is different (largely because of laptop hard drive failure and subsequent
reinstalls), the linux kernel version I'm building (and thus trying to boot)
is different, the compiler I'm building it with is different (4.2.1 instead
of 4.1.2), and my build scripts have changed.  When I run across any particular
symptom, _and_ of that could be the cause.  (Or it could be one of the
other things that changed like the busybox tools developing a subtle sed bug,
been bitten by that before.</p>

<p>Dug up the mailing list thread from
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2009-03/msg00887.html>last
time</a> a random openbios change broke powerpc, and it says svn 6657 used
to work.  That translates to git 2d18e637e5ec, so let's fire that up and
build it verbatim...  And it works.  Yay.</p>

<p>But in this case "works" means it boots the _old_ binaries.  The ones I'm
currently building don't give me any output at all, which implies the serial
console is horked.  Hmmm...</p>

<p>Now I'm iterating through different versions of my build scripts
(much faster) to see where I introduced whichever tool broke it.  (That way I'm
only testing along one axis.)  The 0.9.6 release worked.  The last version
right before I switched to gcc 4.2.1
worked, so it wasn't the infrastructure changes since then.  Commit 752
(first "expected to work" version after the compiler switchover fallout had
shaken out) worked.  So it's not the compiler.  Now we go more slowly.
Next commit (753) updated busybox version... and that worked, so it wasn't
busybox screwing up the build tools.  The actual kernel switchover to 2.6.30
was 754...  Which doesn't build because the powerpc config needs the gratuitous
new symbol to avoid build breaks.  Ok, tweak that, and...</p>

<blockquote><pre>
invalid/unsupported opcode: 00 - 12 - 00 (00009024) 0000938c 0
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now it's failing with a _reason_, which is an improvement.  But it's
definitely the kernel update that's doing it.</p>

<p>Of course now we're back to "two changes which can't be separated"
territory; is the new kernel horked or does the config need to be changed
more?  (These are sort of aspects of the same question, but still...)</p>

<p>Now I need to bisect through kernel versions, of course.  (Bisecting
through things that take several minutes to build is way slower than it
seems, because I switch to other windows and get distracted and don't come
back promptly.  It can take me an hour to go through three versions if
other things are interesting enough that I forget what I was doing...)</p>

<p>Ok.  Dug up the release binaries of system-image-powerpc, which was
known working with some previous version of qemu as of 3 months ago
(albeit with some patching).  The two new problems (the -hda argument
actually setting /dev/hdc, and init segfaulting with the kernel trying
to access memory it shouldn't) are both in the old binary, which means
qemu is what changed.</p>

<p>Bisecting through qemu revisions that need to be patched to have any
chance of booting anything sucks.  Especially when different ranges
of the history need different patches...</p>

<p>Ok, 179a2c1971 can't find _any_ hard drive with this bios, 2fbc409571 can.
Looks like 513f789f6b18 might be the relevant change between those...  And
it is.  That's where qemu switched from using hardwired layout info to
querying openbios (and hence the device tree) for it.  The new layout has
hda/b and hdc/d swapped (the primary and secondary IDE controllers,
apparently), and the panic due to accessing some invalid resource seems
similar.  (It's not the kernel, I'm testing a binary that used to work.)</p>

<p>Went to the doctor and got another cat scan (we have four at home, but
the one they have is specially trained) which showed that I still have a
sinus infection but A) not as bad, B) in a totally different place.
I'm callin this progress!  Got another 10 days of antibiotics.  Feeling
better already, although that's probably the placebo effect.</p>
</span>

<p>Went over to Mark's in the evening and fiddled with getting the
nightly cron job stuff working.  Played whack-a-mole with things that
almost, but not quite, actually work.  (I hate git.  The tarballs git
archive creates contain no version information, ala mercurial's
.hg_archival.txt file.  For years the busybox tar command
complains about some weird comment record when I extract these tarballs,
but when it comes to actually trying to _get_ version info, nothing.)</p>

<p>I asked on the busybox mailing list, and they suggested they could
tweak their cron script that creates 'em to put a version string in the
directory --prefix.  Better than nothing, I suppose.  My build scripts
are carefully designed to _ignore_ this information at the moment, of
course.  Sigh...</p>

<span id=entertainment>
<p>Mark had a series of videos called "Chi comes home" (and a second
season called "Chi's new address") which are hard to describe.  "Kitty
porn" comes pretty close.  Kitten porn in this case.  Or perhaps
"Kawaii diabetic attack".  I DARE you to get through even the
<a href=/chi2.mkv>opening credits</a> with a straight face, let alone a
full episode.  (There are 104 of those in the first season.  That's episode
2.  Yes, it's a series of 3 minute cartoon videos about a kitten,
and it is horrible yet awesome.  I have not yet shown Fade because she
might go into shock.)</p>

<p>The first episode isn't quite representative of the series, since it's
the kitten wandering away from its mother and hence three minutes of
way too cute _angst_ instead of pure uncut refined cuteness like the
others.  Although if you want angst done inexplictably well, there's a
<a href=http://aliceandkev.wordpress.com>blog</a> telling the story of
a homeless family of sims.  It's a father and daughter pair of sims set up
on an empty lot with no money and nothing but 2 park benches as "home",
allowing Sims 3's "free will" option to dictate their behavior as much as it
can (everything but aspirations and opportunity pop-ups), and writing up
their story with screenshots and prose.  It is FAR more emotionally involving
than it has any right to be, although you really have to start at
<a href=http://aliceandkev.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/test/>the beginning</a>
to appreciate it.</p>

<p>There's a weird sort of yin/yang in the above two paragraphs, now that

<p>Felt totally out of it this morning.  Slept through an hour of Fade and
two cats trying to wake me up.  (Well, sluggished and didn't get out of
bed, anyway.  Only actually _slept_ through part of it.)  Went out and
got rather a lot of Fade's old games mailed (she's culling the herd of her
gaming collection, I've got a big bag of stuff to donate to the next
convention with a gaming room, too).  Then we went to the Kolache factory
and I smashed a taillight in my car against a dumpster backing out.  (That
was enough to convince Fade to drive, despite her massive aversion to
driving.)</p>

<p>Went home meaning to nap, but by that point I was up.  I work based on
momentum, even when "work" isn't relaly an operative word.  Lurch, perhaps.</p>

<p>This was, however, enough to get me to make a doctor's appointment for
the darn sinus infection that's been screwing up my sleep.  Maybe the
_sixth_ round of antibiotics will do something useful.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Got the perl removal patches
<a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0906.2/03190.html>resubmitted</a>
for 2.6.31.  (It's technically still the merge window, let's see if they make
it in this time.)</p>

<p>Even though the changes from 2.6.29 were one minor cosmetic tweak and
rediffing so the offsets matched up, it took hours to do this because
I'd totally forgotten how (and I had to write up new descriptions).  My
own cannonicalize.sh script seems to have gotten lost sometime in the
past 3 months, so I had to write <a href=/cannon.sh>a new one</a>.
(It puts a patch in the cannonical format for linux-kernel.  Yes,
it has my name and email hardwired into it, it's my script.)</p>

<p>Now at Starbucks.  Still bisecting the qemu powerpc stuff.  Building
qemu is slow...</p>

<p>Hey, my daily google alert thingy just pointed me at my <a href=http://www.impactlinux.com/fwl/>Firmware Linux</a> page on the impactlinux website.
Um, yay?</p>

<p>So bisect narrowed down 9d479c119b42b8a548f8d79a8e5a1c1ce2932d91
which was the openbios update that made the sucker start booting again,
but which was _after_ whichever change swapped hda and hdc.  (And
presumably whatever caused the powerpc image to start panicing with a null
pointer dereference right after userspace got control even when you work
around that.)</p>

<p>It's possible the panic is a kernel change and not a qemu change, but
lemme try 0.10.1 with the other openbios and make sure I can reproduce
the problem here before trying to bisect the kernel build.</p>

<p>Mark's epic adventure in iPhone recovery <a href=http://apple.slashdot.org/story/09/06/22/1412234/Tracking-Thieves-With-Find-my-iPhone>made slashdot</a>,
and from there has been picked up by several other sites.  If you're going
to carry around an orwellian tracking device with an ambient audio pickup
(hello, speakerphone mode and no LED to tell you when the microphone's powered
up?) you might as well get some use out of it.</p>

<p>Speaking of slashdot, I see that blue-ray <a href=http://hothardware.com/News/Bluray-Adoption-Still-Sluggish-HDTV-Sales-Up/>still sucks</a>.
Apparently 9% of americans own a blu-ray player, but 11% have HD-DVD (a format
that's been dead for a year).  The really odd part of that survey is that
only 7% of respondents said they owned a blu-ray player, apparently the
other 2% didn't even realize (or care) heir PS3 plays the things.</p>
<p>Of course 83% of the population owns some kind of DVD player, so
conventional DVD sold 6 times as many disks as blu-ray last year, and that's
with the blu-ray people rebuying all their _old_ videos in blu-ray
reissues.</p>

<p>Yeah, I stand by what I said the
<a href=notes-2008.html#11-08-2008>last</a> few
<a href=notes-2008.html#06-01-2008>times</a> I mentioned this topic:
digital video files trump this.  The CD doesn't matter much once you've
got an ipod or similar, and attempts to introduce a new physical media
music format wouldn't get much attention these days.  Video is at most
10 years behind audio, the writing's been on the wall for _years_.
Even DVD barely made it in time.</p>

<p>(A digital disk you could burn 250 gigabytes of arbitrary files on for
under $1 might be interesting, but by the time any of the formats supply
that capacity or that cheapness, flash will have won.)</p>

<p>Last night my laptop did one of those "everything freezes but the mouse

reliability.  Oh well.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>This morning (up before noon!) I'm rebuilding powerpc with gcc 4.1.2,
and if the behavior differs I'll build the various packages with each toolchain
and see _which_ package is having a behavior difference.  (It's also possible
that it stopped working when I reinstalled Linux at the start of the month,
which means the qemu it's using now and the one it used to have are very
different.  This is really to see which of those two ratholes to go down.)</p>

<p>And it's the qemu one.  Ok, fire up git...  And I have to go
--disable-werror now because the Werror disease has spread to qemu.
(Different gcc versions produce different warnings.  Differently patched
distros produce different warnings, such as not checking the return value
of asprintf().  Apparently that's a warning now.  So is ignoring the return
value of chdir("/").  Maybe that's an Ubuntu thing, I dunno, but in general
-Werror is _useless_ these days.</p>

<p>Repairing my desktop again while it builds.  I don't know why some of the
things I add to the xfce taskbar survive reboots, but others don't.  This is
the... 5th time I've added the CPU governor plugin, I think?  (The battery
icon doesn't show you current CPU speed, or let you change it, which is one
of the main ways to control battery life.  You have to go dig up a separate
control for that.)</p>

<p>I suppose I don't really mind having a separate little fiddly plugin for
everything.  What is it about volume controls that Linux desktop developers
have such trouble with?  The KDE one was good: that had a little speaker in the
tool bar that gave you a slider pop-up when you clicked on it, and went away
when you clicked on anything else.  The Gnome one had a slider pop-up that
never went away unless you explicitly clicked on the speaker icon a second
time to dismiss it, and displayed above everything else.  That was annoying.</p>

<p>The Xfce one doesn't have a pop-up, instead it creates a new window every
time you click on it.  Did I mention that creating a new window takes about 5
seconds, during which you have no acknowledgement that anything is happening
until the new window suddenly appears?  Did I mention that you can have
a half-dozen of these old volume windows lying around if they fall to the back
of the z-order instead of getting closed?  Did I mention they take
up almost 1/4 of the screen for what is essentially a single control slider?
Yeah, I know.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I want the xfce general desktop with the kde volume control.  Even if I
could mix and match them (they don't seem to have a common docking API),
the KDE thing would suck in 100 megabytes of shared libraries to twiddle the
volume.  The "let 1000 flowers bloom" approach only works if there's some
way to integrate the result, and after 20 years of X-based GUI development
we've got nothing in that department.</p>
</span>

<span id=programming>
<p>Ok, so the first problem is that -hda is showing up as /dev/hdc.  That's
odd.  Is this because I'm using the -git version of qemu?  I think I was
using the 0.10.1 release before, lemme try building that...</p>

<p>Great, 0.10.1 dies in the bios (I traced this down once; doing so
sucked), and in current -git the bios is fine but the emulated hardware
has at least two obvious things wrong with it.  Maybe I can git bisect
a sweet spot where everything worked...</p>

<p>Meanwhile, upgraded the kernel to 2.6.30.  The perl removal patches
are unchanged except for applying at an offset now.  I am officially
nervous about this, but can respin and resubmit them Monday morning.</p>

<p>So, smoketest-all.sh is reporting that armv5l, armv6l, i586, i686,
mips, mipsel, and x86_64 are passing.  This leaves m68k,
powerpc, powerpc-440fp, sh4, and sparc reporting failure.</p>

<p>Sparc's been broken forever, and m68k isn't supported by qemu yet.
I checked sh4 by hand and the problem is it's so slow the new timeout
logic is triggering (which is realy a minor qemu problem, very slow emulator
for that target).  Run by hand with no timeout, it works.  It just takes
over a minute to boot up and compile "hello world".  (It seems to be
some kind of timeout in the emulated hardware, actually.  Once hello
world is built, it runs essentially instantly.)</p>

<p>The powerpc target seems to be building fine, it just won't run.  Or
more accurately, the kernel boots but it can't find the hard drive to
mount the root filesystem.  This sounds familiar.  But how did chaning
the _compiler_ break this?  (Build break due to pointless extra error
checking rejecting a construct that used to compile just fine, I can
at least understand.  But this is a change in _behavior_.)</p>

<p>Biked out to Whataburger for exercise shortly before midnight.  Apparently
when my bike got hit by a car, the seat broke so the little metal tab holding

disconcerting when you're sitting on it and lean back slightly.  Grabbed a
pair of pliers and got it semi-fixed for now, but I need to take it back to the

about 15 graffiti tags on the ride, pondered taking a spray bottle of paint
stripper, gloves, and a scrub brush with me in a plastic bag next time, but
that would pretty much take up the night because I'm not really _looking_

seconds and booting back up to the desktop, first complaining that the
nspluginviewer.bin wouldn't freeze.  (Well, actually some white text flashed

<p>So I figured out what dmesg was trying to say (the multi-page stack dumps
didn't actually help here, they were just a distraction from the list of
processes it couldn't suspend at the end) and killed all instances of
nspluginviewer.  Next it complaining cifsd wouldn't freeze, so I tracked down
a dead samba mount that hadn't prevented it from freezing when I was at Mark's
place earlier today, but was suddenly a problem now.  (At a guess, the samba
thread only blocks uninterruptibly waiting for a response from the server when
it doesn't hear back from it, so when I was behind Mark's firewall it happily
suspended because the server said it was ok, but when I wasn't it wouldn't.
I gloss over 5 minutes of trying to get it to umount when one of my open
terminal tabs had a shell prompt open with the current directory under that
mount point.  Well, actually the terminal tab had a root prompt at /, but
if you exited _that_ the parent process was a shell prompt with its current
directory under the /mnt in question.  Linux: smell the usability.)</p>

<p>Fade has suggested that rather than buying my sister a new laptop, we
just send her Reepicheep the eeepc, freeing Fade up to buy an iPhone.  She's
got the eeepc for school but hasn't actually needed a laptop in any of her
classes (literature major), and has wandered back to using her mac laptop the
rest of the time she's not on The Monolith.</p>

<p>The fact that there exists a "Sims 3 for the iPhone" (which she's been
told is "the best Tamagochi ever") might be a factor in Fade's decision.
I suspect she'd plead the 5th if I asked.</p>

<p>Her buying an iPhone would continue the trend of Fade having way cooler
hardware than I do.  She gets all the new tech toys, while my laptop is on its
second set of ram and third hard drive.  (Speaking of which, I suspect that the
"Ubuntu eats hard drives" issue is not limited to the hitachi drive the laptop
came with.  I should set the hdparm -B 255 thing in the init scripts again.
Er, make that the acpi resume scripts, since just putting it in the init
scripts isn't enough.  SMELL THE USABILITY.)</p>

<p>Next time I'm connected to the internet I should probably track down and
install the tool to tell me whether or not Linux is slowly destroying my
hardware again.  I think it was smartctl or some such?  I've upgraded ubuntu
three times since this issue <a href=notes-2007.html#31-10-2007>first
surfaced</a>, but it's not like I can expect Ubuntu to actually fix something
as trivial as a literally hardware-destroying bug given a mere 2 years to do
so.  (I suppose on twitter this would be "#smelltheusability".)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>I'm gradually wandering back into BusyBox development, although this
currently consists of posting on the list a lot and getting into arguments
with the other developers.  (Yeah, par for the course I know.)</p>

<p>Some prominent TODO items I have, off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>Busybox:</li>
<ul>
<li>Check toybox commands, check what can be ported to busybox.
(Patch definitely.  Netcat?)</li>
<li>Test suite: Check toybox tests, see what an be merged.  Covert
rest of busybox tests from subdir to command.tests format.</li>
<li>Update/break up toybox structural documentation, post each piece
to busybox with rationale.  Convince people it's a good idea, then do
huge amounts of coverting work to move all the busybox applets over.
(Figure out how to do this in stages; it's a huge amount of work.)</li>
<li>Port busybox to the iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<li>FWL</li>
<ul>
<li>Get all architectures working again.  (Yes, that includes sparc.  And see if
the m68k stuff that's gotten posted to the list actuallly works.)</li>
<li>Get nightly builds happening and uploading for uClibc, busybox, and
kernel tests.  Figure out where to upload stuff.  (To impactlinux.com of course,
but should I also upload toolchains to my dir on kernel.org?  System images with
native toolchains on uClibc.org?  Static busybox binaries for each target to
busybox.org?  How often, weekly?  Run test suites?)</li>
<li>Cut a release.</li>
</ul>
<li>Kernel</li>
<ul>
<li>Perl removal patches.</li>
<li>Miniconfig.</li>
<li>Hello world kernel.</li>
</ul>
<li>qemu</li>
<ul>
<li>Test m68k.</li>
<li>QEMU weekly news.</li>
<li>Qemu C Commpiler (qcc)</li>
</ul>
<li>Dig up the C++ paper and do another pass.</li>
<li>Figure out how my desktop's once again grown 4 browser windows with a
couple dozen tabs each and close 'em.  (I'm slowly growing to tolerate
Firefox.  Yes it hangs for 20 seconds at random intervals, refusing to
even repaint its windows until it's done.  But the new version of kmail
is doing that now too.  #ineedtobuyamac)</li>
<li>Watch the two netflix DVDs I have with me, and/or the accumulated
podcasts, and/or the videos I downloaded from Mark.</li>
<li>Learn LUA.</li>
<li>Update the rss feed creation script to parse the "span" tags I've been
putting in this blog for the past year or so, and create rss feeds with _just_
that content for each tag.</li>
<li>Read "Kitty and the Midnight Hour" (bought 2 more books in this series
at Hypericon and I'm starting it over from the beginning, so I threw that
book in my backpack too).</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 8 zillion other things on the todo list (biking here was
"get exercise"), but those are the "might feel like working on them if I sit
down to do something now.</p>

<p>So, attacking the FWL broken architectures.  x86, x86_64, and mips (but
not mipsel) are working.  Let's see what's wrong with armv5l, that's usually
a fairly reliable one:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
  CC      networking/dnsd.o
networking/dnsd.c: In function 'process_packet':
networking/dnsd.c:428: error: lvalue required as unary '&amp;' operand
networking/dnsd.c:430: error: lvalue required as unary '&amp;' operand
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Oddly enough, I'm pretty sure that's _not_ the same error that happened
on securitybreach (the 8-way gentoo server), but let's get it working here
first before debugging it there.</p>

<p>Step 1, try to build busybox from the command line with the cross compiler.
So:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
cd ~/busybox/git
mkdir ../temp
git archive master | tar xvC ../temp
make allyesconfig KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=~/firmware/firmware/sources/trimconfig-busybox
PATH=~/firmware/firmware/build/cross-compiler-armv5l/bin:$PATH make CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l-
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>And it... built to the end just fine.  Ok, what I built was more or less
current -git, rather than the release version.  (I only have one outstanding
patch, for pgrep, and that's almost certainly not relevant here.)  So maybe
they fixed it, and maybe this just isn't reproducing it.  (I note that
git tag -l doesn't even show a 1_14_0 tag, the newest is 1_13_4, but I think
that's an artifact of the svn->git conversion.  I should ask on the list.)
So, try again with the busybox 1.14.0 tarball the build was using, and...</p>

<p>Yes, it reproduces the error, and the git version of busybox doesn't.  Do
a diff between the git networking/dnsd.c and the one in 1.14.0 and... they're
identical.  So something in some header changed.  The error is happening
on a call to move_to_unaligned32(), and that's defined in include/platform.h
so let's see what the diff is between those two...</p>

<p>And the file is _full_ of unnecessary whitespace changes.  BRILLIANT.  Ok,
try again with diff -b...</p>

<p>Well, that explains why x86 and x86_64 work:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#if defined(i386) || defined(__x86_64__)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I'm wondering why mips worked.  (Presumably the guts of gcc 4.2.1
didn't complain about the lvalue thing on mips.)  Which brings up the
question of why mipsel _didn't_ work...  yup, it's complaining about the
same lvalue thing.</p>

<p>Ok, all architectures brought down by the same busybox bug, which seems
to be fixed in source control.  It's git 3be23086 in the busybox repository
thing, applied on April 17th.  (I note that "git blame" is kind of useless
if something else, like a pointless whitespace change, has touched the
file since.  With mercurial you can subtract one from the commit number
you want to see before and do an "hg annotate -r commit filename".  But you
can't do previous/next math on git commit hashes.  Smell the usability.</p>

<a name="18-06-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#18-06-2009">June 18, 2009</a></h2>
<p>It's possible that <a href=http://twitter.com/landley>twitter</a> is
reducing my incentive to blog.  But where else <a href=http://twitter.com/donttrythis/status/2221596444>do you learn</a> that Adam Savage
of Mythbusters appeared in a Billy Joel video when he (Adam) was 16?</p>

<p>My problem with pkill's weird error message was that smoketest.sh goes
through the normal sources/includes.sh setup and thus sets the $PATH to use
the build/host tools if they exist, meaning it was the _busybox_ version
of pkill spitting out that error message, and that indeed didn't implement
-P.  Went and implemented it, then caught up on the busybox list (since the
start of the month, anyway).</p>

<p>Now I'm plotting and scheming how to migrate busybox to the toybox
infrastructure for early setup and option parsing, since if I'm going to
do significantly more work on busybox I don't want to _know_ there's a
better way to do stuff and not use it.</p>

<p>Toybox let me work out some significantly better infrastructure for doing
a swiss-army-knife program, and proved that whatever claim Bruce Fscking
Perens may have had to early Busybox (even if Red Hat's Nash didn't do exactly
the same thing, even if he hadn't clearly gotten the idea from gzip without
attribution, and even if there wasn't any of his code left by the time
I <a href=http://busybox.net/~landley/forensics.txt>bothered to check</a>
(well he'd pissed me off, but he's good at that)...  Anyway, toybox proved
that I can, and did, reimplement at least that much from scratch.  (And
properly from scratch rather than merely gluing together applets other
people wrote.)  So I no longer need to worry about that Schlemiel.</p>

<p>And without the _aversion_ of Bruce Disease, doing toybox as a separate
project doesn't make all that much sense.  BusyBox has a ten year headstart,
a couple dozen reasonably active developers, and is easy to incrementally
improve.</p>

<p>That said, I did a lot of good work in toybox, and a lot of what it _does_
do it does better than busybox.  I want to fold that back into busybox, and
that's a pretty big task in and of itself.</p>

<p>That said, I need to get the perl removal patches for the linux kernel
updated to apply to 2.6.30 and submitted during the current merge window
(which is a week old already).  And before I do _that_ I need to test it
on all the FWL arches which means I need to figure out why only x86, x86_64,
and mips are currently building with gcc 4.2.1 and fix it.  And to do
_that_ I needed smoketest-all.sh to stop hanging on sparc, which is why
I needed pkill to work to asynchronously enforce a timeout on
qemu-system-sparc.</p>

<p>Got a bit frustrated about the stack getting longer as new tangents kept
inserting themselves in a "getting tomato juice to Colnel Potter" fashion.
(MASH reference, don't worry about it.  "Swallowed the spider ot catch the
fly" would also work.)  But this has been my normal working methodology for
as long as I've been working on Firmware Linux.  (Since my initial research
for it involved pestering people in person at Atlanta Linux Showcase in 1999,
you could say I've been doing it for a decade now.)</p>

<a name="15-06-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#15-06-2009">June 15, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Huh, that'll probably confuse people's rss readers.  Yesterday's entry
was mis-dated (today's the 15th) and I just fixed it.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>So yesterday I got x86_64 building all the canadian stuff with gcc 4.2.1,
and checked it in.  Then I told the 8-way server to build all the targets
and went to bed, and today I find that half the architectures went boing.</p>

<p>Sigh.  I _really_ need to get linux-2.6.30 building today so I can update
whatever may have changed in the perl removal patches and submit that upstream,
but this is being stroppy.  Armv5l died with this during the cross-static
build of uClibc:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
libc/stdio/_READ.c: In function '__stdio_READ':
libc/stdio/_READ.c:39: error: 'LONG_MAX' undeclared (first use in this function)
libc/stdio/_READ.c:39: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
libc/stdio/_READ.c:39: error: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [libc/stdio/_READ.os] Error 1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But usr/include/limits has it?  So what exactly is it complaining about?</p>

<p>But first, I need to get smoketest.sh to kill its child processes.  I want
a "kill --recurseive 12345" that takes out all the child processes and their
children and so on, but apparently I've hit yet another thing that the standard
unix tools never bothered to implement.</p>

<p>I am so _sick_ of fighting the shell.  The sparc target hangs when
you try to test it, so testall.sh gets hung up on that one.  I can run a
background process that does "kill $(jobs -p)" after a timeout, or does a
"pkill -P $$", I can set a trap "pkill -P $(jobs -p)" EXIT, and so on.  But
so far, nothing but "killall qemu-system-sparc" actually kills the qemu
instance.</p>

<p>I'm running a script that's running a script that's calling qemu, and the
child processes don't get killed when the parent process goes away.  After
the qemu instance hangs it doesn't get killed when its parent shell script
gets killed by a signal, and the traps I'm putting in won't propogate down
to it.  (The buggy error messages don't help: "pkill -P pid" complains "no
signal P" when the pid in question has already exited, which is _not_
helpful...</p>

<p>Such crap.  Such total crap.  This is not the bug I'm trying to fix,
I keep hitting OTHER bugs that won't _let_ me get to the bug I'm trying
to fix.  And then I hit othe bugs when trying to debug that.</p>

<p>Linux is buggier now than it was under Red Hat 9.  Why am I bothering?</p>

<a name="14-06-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#14-06-2009">June 14, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Friday I bought Mark a steak dinner as a bribe so he'd get my cell phone
internet working again.  I also copied zillions of bittorrented files he had
lying around, partly because there's no other way to get _all_ the episodes
of mythbusters or MST3K because the first only put out a random subset of the
episodes on DVD and the second had licenses expire between the intial broadcast
and the invention of DVD.  (I have netflix.  I'd happily get this stuff
through there, the way I'm doing with bleach.  I just can't.  And as when
Hulu stopped being fun due to stupid watermarking and ads over the video,
I'm fine with that.)</p>

<p>I spent the whole of yesterday watching Fade play "Sims 3" and reading
through the archives of <a href=http://agirlandherfed.com>A Girl and her
Fed</a>.</p>

<p>Today I made it out of the house by 5pm to head out with my laptop and
finally get some work done.  The 2.6.30 kernel is out (and yes I typed
"0.9.30" on my first attempt, but at the rate uClibc gets release out
and the kernel _does_, that won't be a problem for long), so I need
to try it and see what needs updating in the perl removal patches and
the miniconfig stuff.  (I need to fix miniconfig to open menu symbols when
I switch on menu contents.  Actually I need to write up a _list_ of all
the projects I'd do if I had more time and energy, and hope somebody else
finds them interesting and does them for me...)</p>

<p>Wandered to McDonalds, but barely made it in the door before two
different homeless people passed me (one waiting in line for a drink
refill, the other just passing the line at right angles) and I was driven
back outside by the smell.  It's June in Texas, not bathing or even changing
clothes for several days results in _weapons_grade_ stench.</p>

<p>The smell wasn't a problem in previous years, I guess the facilities
Rebecca told me about offering free showers to homeless people have finally
been overwhelmed by the increasing numbers of them in this city.  Rebecca
sells flowers on Guadalupe, she's been there since the dot-com crash.  Last
I talked to her she had a special low-income housing apartment, but for most
of that time she lived in various homeless shelters.  That's what being
homeless in Austin used to mean, it meant you spent your nights in a
homeless shelter.  But the shelters seem to have been overwhelmed by sheer
numbers.</p>

<p>I'm aware the concept of homelessness isn't new, even to Austin.  Heck, a
homeless crossdressing man named "Leslie" ran for mayor the first
couple elections after I arrived, and came in third.  He was a fixture around
town, and got free drinks on 6th street.  (I met him, but never smelled him.)
Back when I lived on Far West and bought the second condo next to me, I rented
it out ot a guy who used to be homeless but had put his life back together.
(Admittedly he totally trashed it and it took $20k worth of work to make the
place sellable again, but that wasn't _entirely_ his fault.  Long story.)
Reese was homeless for a while, and I let her live rent free with me for most
of a year while she went through a 12 step program.  (Last I heard she was
properly medicated, employed, and getting married.)</p>

<p>But it used to be an issue like flooding that the city could deal with,
not a problem that had overwhelemed the city's coping mechanisms.  Now there's
bands of homeless people camping on Guadalupe.  They hang out at the south
edge of the parking lot at 25th street (up to half a dozen at a time there),
and another group in front of the closed "Intellectual Property" bookstore
store at 24th street (usually not more than 4 at a time there), and a large
group of a dozen or more on the front steps of the church across from the
Dobie Mall.  And those are just the ones I pass regularly on my way around
campus.  (Oddly, the Guadalupe "drag rats" didn't used to be _homeless_.
Most of them were _students_ who panhandled for extra money, and as a way of
being edgy without dressing goth.)</p>

<p>I gave up on The Donald's and am across the street at Wendy's now.  Not
quite as fond of the food (their dollar menu leans very heavily towards the
breaded and fried, and they don't have diet doctor pepper, but the #5 combo
is decent and frostys are a nice change).  But I can't breath in the McDonalds
and for some reason this Wendy's hasn't been nearly as heavily colonized by
homeless people presumably looking for someplace air conditioned to wait out
the heat of the day.</p>

<p>There used to be a homeless man called "Jennifer" at this Wendy's, all day
every day for about a year.  (Imagine Richard Simmons with long hair, a dress,
and a pair of the fake rubber breasts british soccer players seem to find
funny, although in this case they were probably implanted prosthetics rather
than strap-on ones.)  I stopped coming here because I couldn't work, because
he NEVER STOPPED TALKING.  To everyone and anyone in here, or failing that
talking back to the TV (and managing to be significantly louder than it).</p>

<p>According to the Austin Chronicle, he died over the winter.  Apparently, he
was a homeless rights and transgender issues advocate constantly poking the
Austin city council, so his death was newsworthy enough for the Chronicle to
devote a column to it.  (I didn't actually know he was homeless, just lonely.
It's hard to get a Michael-Jackson level of screwed up by plastic surgery
without having had money at some point, and he never had trouble buying
food.  I also don't remember ever smelling him, and he could get pretty close
when he was talking at you.)</p>

<p>I also want the city council to do something, I'm just not entirely sure
what, or how to go about asking them.</p>

<p>Homeless shelter showers apparently aren't the only part of Austin
infrastructure to get overwhelmed recently.  I've heard that Austin has a
"graffitti unit", and Google came up with
<a href=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/health/graffiti.htm>this</a>,
but I've never seen them actually do anything.</p>

<p>Biking here to Wendy's (less than 10 blocks) I counted around 35 separate
instances of grafitti tags.  And that's _after_ I decided to keep it out of
the alley behind my condo.  (Noticed another one there today, although I think
I just missed last week rather than it being fresh.)  They're on edges of the
sidewalk, lamp posts, walls, dumpsters, the back of real estate signs, the
front of traffic signs...  All over really.  None of it "artisic", just
tagging: each instance is some clueless twit needing to pee on a fire hydrant
to mark territory, and being unequipped by nature to do so.</p>

<p>The switch from small amounts of artistic grafitti (heck, property owners
commissioned it as advertising and the people who did it had _art_shows_)
to large amounts of random tagging started shortly after Hurricane Katrina,
back when the feds bussed several thousand displaced people here and dumped
them.  Perhaps that's just a coincidence, but whatever the reason it didn't
used to be a _problem_.  I didn't notice it at _all_ my first few years
in the city, and it still wasn't significant when I bought my current condo in
2003, but now it's everywhere.</p>

<p>Anyway, now I'm trying to actually use the cell modem, and I'm
intermittently getting this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
HTTP ERROR: $CODE$

$MESSAGE$

RequestURI=/2009/06/edinburgh-in-august.html
</pre></blockquote>

<p>That was from journal.neilgaiman.com, but I got the exact same error from
a URL on www.ameriblog.com, differing only in URL.  At a guess, t-mobile is
using some kind of funky squid-like web cacheing proxy thing, which is
overloading.  This isn't the _only_ strange web-only error I've seen, another
page spontaneously lost its mime type and asked me if I wanted to download
"next.php" for what was happily recognized as an HTML page when I hit reload.
But this lets the cat out of the bag about WHAT the problem is: t-mobile has
a piece of software trying to "help" rather than keeping its fingers out of my
packets.  Wheee...</p>

<p>I can probably work around this by tunneling to another machine and
convincing my network layer (or at least Firefox) to use it as a socks/proxy
thing.  (ssh -Nf -D 127.0.0.1:8080 remotemachine.com)  It's sad that I have to
go to extra lengths to get a dumb TCP/IP network to _act_ like a dumb TCP/IP
network, and just transmit packets without trying to understand their content.
But that's the modern ISP for you.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I dug up my old copy of neverwinter nights, but character generation was
such a slideshow (mouse position updating about once a second, which is kind
of hard to use with a touchpad) I gave up.  It worked fine on my previous
laptop, which also ran Linux.  (This game is so old that it was back
when people bothered to put out Linux versions of games.  World of Warcraft
even had a Linux client during its beta.  Back when people thought Linux
on the desktop might actually matter someday.)</p>

<p>So back to watching "bleach" dvds and banging on FWL, at The Donald's
(where the apple pies seem to have fixed themselves, dunno if it was just
a bad batch, if I was consistently getting them dehydrated, or if
corporate changed its mind).</p>

<p>The prerequisite system-image.sh is checking for is the existence of
the root-filesystem-$ARCH directory, and that's not a particularly useful
test.  Sure if the cross compiler didn't build, that shouldn't exist, but
if the root filesystem build died halfway through...</p>

<p>The problem is, what specifically can I test for in the root filesystem
directory that says it completed successfully?  I _want_ to be able to pack
up fairly arbitrary contents, so setting a flag file at the end of the build
is exactly the kind of dependency between stages I _don't_ want them to
have.</p>

<p>The root-filesystem.sh script has a natural dependeency: it can't build
without the appropriate cross compiler.  It doesn't care where that compiler
came from, just that it's in the $PATH.  The system images don't.  I could add
a flag to indicate that it _failed_, but that's a bit non-obvious for comfort.
(When it's not asynchronous, return codes work fine, which is why this hasn't
come up before.)</p>

<p>I'm torn between trying to properly fix this (although I have no idea
how) or just hacking temporary tests into the scripts (yet again) to abort
at the point I want to see the output.  I guess it depends on what I'm
trying to fix next.  Eh, bop it on the head with a brick for now, get
back to beating the behavior I want out of my old enemy, gcc.</p>

<p>So gcc/config.cache needs to contain "gcc_cv_as_hidden=yes" and
"gcc_cv_ld_hidden=yes".  I could just prepopulate the cache with this, but
_why_ is the test failing?  (It doesn't seem to log that part.)  Hmmm...</p>

<p>Ah.  It decided the assembler name it's using is "".  That's just
BRILLIANT.  Right, explicitly set AS_FOR_TARGET, which for some reason
4.1.2 didn't need but 4.2.1 does.  You'd think there would be a way to
just specify the darn prefix for all these tools, but no...</p>

<p>Breakfast at Einstein's, then decided to bike south to the Chick-fil-a
location near SJG to try to work off some of the calories from the con this
weekend.  (Making lots of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, cutting them into
quarters, and filling aluminum trays with them?  Marvelous idea.  A german
restaurant with a live polka band indoors?  Not so much.)  Going down The Drag
I got hit by a car that turned right out of the Schlotzky's parking lot
without looking, but luckily I'd seen the "how the stuntmen do it" things
(my behind the scenes at hollywood hobby came in useful) and rolled up
on the hood like you're supposed to, and my laptop landed on top of me.
The bike, alas, wasn't so lucky, and the front tire was all wobbyly afterwards,
and I had to spend $60 getting it replaced.  Didn't actually make it out
towards Chick-fil-a until around 5:30 pm.</p>

<p>Reason #9437 why Linux on the Desktop sucks rocks: every couple hours,
the wireless network will suddenly stop working, with no warning.  Generally,
it means this happened:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
[15163.962304] iwl3945: Microcode SW error detected.  Restarting 0x82000008.
[15163.962326] iwl3945: Error Reply type 0x00000005 cmd REPLY_TX (0x1C) seq 0x0000 ser 0x0000004B
[15163.964337] iwl3945: Can't stop Rx DMA.
</pre></blockquote>

<p>And under Ubuntu 9.04 _that_ means you're going to reboot soon.  In previous
Ubuntu versions, you could "modprobe -r iwl3945" and then insert the module
back in, and you'd get your wireless back.  But in 9.04, if you try it your
kernel will panic.  New and improved!</p>

<p>This is why I've given up on Linux on the desktop.  Each new release breaks
things that used to work, and this has been true for TWENTY YEARS now.  On
a personal level, why should I "get out and push" if the people steering wind
up in a ditch or going off a cliff every single time?</p>

<p>Open source does not competently handle user interface issues because
"shut up and show me the code" is not a useful response to aesthetic issues
or usability problems.  It's an inherent structural problem withour development
model.  Suppose a user notices something obviously STUPID, like the fact that
the default action on battery drain is "shut down" and quickly suspending when
you get the "system is about to shut down" pop-up just means that when you plug
it into AC power and resume, you get to watch it shut down then.  They complain
about it.  We filter out that kind of complaint as noise, and tell them "you
fix it".  Become an expert in our little area, then submit your fix to us and
spend months iteratively convincing us to take it.  Or else leave us alone you
useless freeloader.</p>

<p>These problems are built-in to our development model.  Coding disputes
can be handled via objective tests, benchmarks, code size metrics, and so
on, which can conclusively end arguments with numbers and proofs and logic.
Dealing with more abstract issues, we fork ourselves to death with a thousand
competing implementations, each of which does a couple things better than
anyone else, meaning it does everything else worse.</p>

<p>This feeds into the way "this is a horrible default that bit me" is met with
"here's how you can customize your personal copy, to fix it _for you_".  No
attempt at a general solution is made, because maybe somebody WANTS that
behavior even if most people get bit by it.  Creating a usable environment
requires huge customization effort, but isn't it great how customizable our
system is?  You can build your own desktop.  You must do so, since the default
environment sucks so badly you really have no alternative.  But there are so
many different ones to choose from, if you just spend three years studying
your available options you'll eventually find that special one built just for
you.  Don't like Totem?  Try VLC!  Don't like Pidgin?  Try Jabber!  Don't
like Thunderbird?  We've got _hundreds_ of alternatives...</p>

<p>So it's easy to _leave_, but hard to actually get anything _fixed_.  Users
who can't or won't back up their reports with scientific metrics are ignored.
Or those who don't regularly perform regression testing, or who aren't going
to spend six months following up on an issue, or who can't swap out individual
components of their system with ones they built from source (after having
upgraded everything to the latest version because fixes aren't made to the
old versions; you need to be exposed to all the new bugs at once to test
any fixes for your old bug)...</p>

<p>And even if you _do_ try to fix these things, you can't keep up.  Pointing
/bin/sh at dash was _new_ breakage that older Ubuntu didn't have.  KDE 3.x->4.x
was new breakage.  Losing syntax highlighting in vi and the ability to cursor
around in insert mode was new breakage.  Kmail getting eaten by Kontact and
then its user interface changing so hugely in the most recent release I spent
2 hours finding the "sort by thread" option: new breakage.
The same network hardware this laptop has had for 3 years now breaking in
new and exciting ways: new breakage.  The fact 3D support no longer works
for my intel graphics card (it worked fine in 8.10): new breakage.  (Although
a 64-bit dual core 1.73 ghz processor can just about keep up with software
rendering to display video, as long as the system's otherwise idle
and the window size is small enough.  Even then youtube stuff flickers like
mad with the "hidden" under-layer of youtube navigation buttons showing
through intermittently due to the compositing happening in a single live
buffer, and it tends to go all slideshow at the drop of a hat anyway.  Oh,
and swapping windows it sometimes leaves uninitialized memory garbage on
the screen for several seconds, and sometimes the event that would redraw
over it _times_out_ and it's left there in the window's buffer.  Even if
I drag another window over it, the garbage comes back because the redraw is
from a double buffer that's got uninitialized memory in it.  Kmail does this
all the time with its toolbar buttons.)</p>

<p>There's no "steady improvement".  There's no indication of clear
agreed-upon _goals_, just random lateral thrashing.  I keep having to either
abandon existing infrastructure that stops being supported, or personally go
to great lengths to keep the older stuff working in newer contexts.</p>

<p>Because of what I do, I mostly notice this with technical things that end
users only ever notice as "black magic that failed".  On a technical level
it's epidemic, such as the way the IDE devices became part of the SCSI
layer so device ordering is now fundamentally horked in a way it didn't used to
be.  (SCSI throws all devices in a big bucket and gives 'em a stir, so
your USB devices and your SATA devices draw from the same pool of device
names, in first come first serve order.  Yes really.  Back under the IDE
world, /dev/hdc wouldn't move without a screwdriver.)  Or the emergence of
unnecessary layers like the whole HAL/dbus thing, so that your web server goes
"HAL says I'm not connected to the network, so I can't let you talk to that web
server you're got running on the loopback
interface".  (Why does it CARE?  The TCP/IP layer has had a "no route to host"
error for 30 years now, so if there's no network this fact should be instantly
apparent when you try to use it.  Adding a separate layer capable of vetoing
network access is damn stupid, and whether it actually works or not is a side
issue to it having no reason to _exist_ in the first place.)  And don't get
me started on how hideously unstable and undocumented the sysfs exports have
been over the past 20 kernel releases.  So on a purely technical level, the
people steering Linux haven't filled me with confidence in the soundness of
their judgement.</p>

<p>And of course there's social/process things too.  The GPLv2 vs GPLv3 split
didn't help anybody do anything: we're still paralyzed by infighting against
our zealot arm which undermines everything the rest of us try to do, in the
name of "Purity".  (Similarly, I stopped cooperating with the SFLC after the
FSF hijacked them.)</p>

<p>On the social front, the people who insist that openness is inevitable and
in future all scarcity will vanish have apparently never studied history.
Capitalists try to corner the market on things that were previously free
_all_the_time_.  Capitalism is a marvelous mechanism for managing scarcity,
and in the absence of scarcity to manage, capitalism creates it artificially
so it has something to manage.  For example, Austin is now ringed with privately
managed toll roads.  I hate this, but they're still there, and
they're building more.  Individual instances come and it go as people play
whack-a-mole with the latest incarnation, but there isn't going to be some
magic day when people stop TRYING to corner the market and make a killing.</p>

<p>But technical and social issues aside, an awful lot of the time I notice
that my Linux desktop simply doesn't work at an end-user level, and then have
to invoke programmer-fu to try to work around it.</p>

<p>My desktop is Linux.  My desktop doesn't work.  Most of the time I just want
to USE the thing to surf the web, watch videos, read email, edit text,
and it breaks repeatedly and I have to duct tape it back together to get
minimal functionality out of it.  (I STILL haven't gotten the bluetooth
association between my laptop and cell phone set back up.  On Fade's Mac,
it took about five minutes starting fromm scratch, most of which was figuring
out where in the config menus to find the appropriate settings page.)</p>

<p>These little "end user issues" come from everywhere in the infrastructure.
The network spontaneously dying so only a reboot can fix it is a kernel issue.
The 3D support not working anymore is an X11 issue.  When I press the eject
button my my DVD, it gives me a pop-up message 'Failed to eject
"/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/storage_model_CDRWDVD_DW224EV".  Given device
"/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/storage_model_CDRWDVD_DW224EV" is not a volume
or drive." and that's HAL/dbus breakage.  All of those are brand
new failures in 9.04, on the exact same hardware that originally came running
Ubuntu 6.10 from the factory.  (It has more ram and a bigger hard drive
since then, but that's it.)  Installing a new version of ubuntu breaks stuff
that used to work, every time.</p>

<p>The largest chunk of infrastructure I've had to abandon recently is KDE.
I'm now on Xubuntu because the KDE developers did one of those "throw out
all the progress we've made and start over" things that resulted in a KDE 4.x
so hideously unusable that even Linus Torvalds (who has mocked the gnome
developers for years as Just Not Getting It) has abandoned KDE and
gone to Gnome.  (In Kubuntu 8.10, KDE 3.x was no longer an option, and 4.x
simply did not work.)  I tried Gnome for a bit (couldn't stand it, and then the
system's network configuration spontaneously ate itself so badly I had to
reinstall to talk to the network again, and I went back to 8.04 for a while),
and now I'm using XFCE instead.</p>

<p>This is just within Ubuntu, the only distro that's still _trying_ for
the end-user desktop.  I used to use Red Hat, but they abandoned the desktop
and went off to the enterprise market.  (When the call went out for a company
to stand up and defend decss so Linux could play DVDs, they yanked MP3 playback
support from Red Hat 8 and bogged off to the enterprise workstation market,
discontinuing their consumer version entirely one version later.)  I didn't
so much abandon Red Hat as get abandoned by it.  Then I used Knoppix, but while
its "boot from CD" gimmic made it a great platform to demo Linux on various
hardware it never actually transitioned to running from the actual hard drive
at all well.  So I abandoned Knoppix in favor of Ubuntu, then Kubuntu, then
Xubuntu, which are all more or less from the same group.  There are other
distros I could use if I tire of Cannonical's offerings, but that's just another
manifestation of "all of these suck, so we keep trying new ones".</p>

<p>This means I'm now using the third place
desktop (gnome, kde, xfce) on the third place operating system (windows,
macosx, linux).  My configuration's market share doesn't even register,
and NEVER WILL.  I'd say XFCE was even in _fourth_ place behind the desktop the
subnotebook distros (like Easy Peasy) are using for eeepc clones, except that
<a href=http://blogs.computerworld.com/study_windows_clobbers_linux_on_netbooks_with_over_90_share>we lost that niche</a> (as it scaled up past rounding
error, all the new seats it added were Windows) so it's comparing
one flyspeck with another and the result just doesn't matter either way.</p>

<p>Since I've never been able to recommend Gnome with a straight face,
and can no longer recommend current KDE, I'm now back in the OS/2 position
where the desktop I use isn't one I can honestly recommend to anyone else.
I use a weird custom system nobody else has ever heard of, and I may never
actually meet another user of this particular setup in person.  I might
as well still be using an Amiga.</p>

<p>Embedded Linux is still moderately fun, but I used to do Java under OS/2
the same way.  What the code you produce runs on, and the development
environment you produce it in, are two different things.  Linux itself
will be around as long as Java (which is the new Cobol), but the Z80 processor
lasted 30 years and DOS could do just about everything embedded Linux does.
Cisco still sells IOS, and Solaris and even Xenix still have their users.
In a way, the embedded niche is where old techologies go to die.  (And
every supercomputer worth the name is a hand-rolled bespoke job.)  Maybe
the <strike>openmoko</strike> Google phone will stop being "technology in
search of a use case" and start to matter as much as the iPhone or blackberry
one of these days.  I'm not holding my breath, the cell phone companies
have no incentive to give up control when they can sell _ring_tones_ for
profit and people buy them.</p>

<p>It's been "the year of the Linux desktop" every single year since 1998.
We are the boy who cried wolf, and even if it did start to get interesting
in future nobody will ever care, or pay any attention.</p>

<p>This is why I need to buy a mac laptop to do my embedded Linux development on.</p>

<p>We stayed an extra night at the Hypericon hotel, which meant we got an
extra evening with Fade's friends from the Road to Amber mush.</p>

<p>I'd write a con report, but it would be about hanging out with Fade's
online friends IRL, and not about the con at all: Ann is _totally_hot_ and
apparently moving to Siberia for the next few years, Em is a Linux security
geek whom I could have happily geeked out with at great length if either
of us had wanted to talk shop instead of getting away from it all, I keep
forgetting the name of the bouncy lady I fed half I tin of Penguin Mints to
(I mean the thin bouncy lady, the large bouncy lady showed far less enthusiasm
for them and only got 2 or 3 mints although I've forgotten her name too), the
radio announcer guy was fun but _loud_ which came up when he was GM-ing the
unrelated Amber LARP (I was a pseudo-NPC in charge of Arden, and helped 4
people get their victory conditions although only 3 of them kept them through
to the end of the game) and I was trying to discuss secret plans with him,
there were two bald guys who were both fun to hang around but I couldn't tell
'em apart (Fade insists one of them is black, but I honestly couldn't tell; no
really)...  Despite several threats to shave Fade's head (a plan Fade was
not opposed to when she got sufficiently drunk) it didn't happen because
nobody had the right equipment with them...</p>

<p>Part of the problem figuring out who was who (despite name tags) was that
my previous vague acquaintance with these people was via the characters they
play online (I'm not on the mush, but I watch over Fade's shoulder a lot), and
each of them has about 3 characters, including Fade.  (One reason I can
remember Ann more easily is that she only has one character, although in all
honesty the "totally hot" part helped too.)  I did notice that all the male
characters are played by women, and all the female characters are played by
men.  (I believe I spotted one exception all weekend, out of over a dozen
characters.)  Oh, and the in-game marriages don't
line up with real-life marriages, and one guy was married to two or three
women (by which I mean his various female characters were married to different
male characters belonging to different female players)...</p>

<p>So yeah, people.  Fun group.  I now know what it must have been like for
Fade to get dragged along to Ottawa Linux Symposium.  Smile and nod. :)</p>

<p>Driving back to Austin.  We hit the road around 10am, might get home by
midnight.</p>

<p>Can't do much compiling because the laptop battery won't stand for it,
but I've confirmed that the move from gcc 4.1.2 to gcc 4.2.1 is what broke
the static toolchains.  Which means I have no clue WHAT is wrong because too
much stuff changed.  Much debugging to come, but now I must drive again...</p>

<a name="07-06-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#07-06-2009">June 7, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Fade went off to the Hermitage, which was Andrew Jackson's house, to
see how they spun our most bigoted genocidal president to date.  (Em read
the book about Andrew Jackson that was covered on <a href=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=210891&title=jon-meacham>the daily show</a>
a few months back.)</p>

<p>I was vaguely interested in coming along, but slept instead.  The hotel
room has this MARVELOUS bed, I've been taking longish naps all weekend.
It is fluffy.  Didn't actually get up until almost 2, by which time the
convention was winding down.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Poking at the FWL buildall.sh script.  It's broken in several
different ways, but the most fundamental one is that its debug output is
horrible.</p>

<p>The main problem is that buildall.sh does things that build.sh doesn't,
because doing a canadian cross requires multiple architectures, and build.sh
builds one architecture through from start to finish.  This means if I
want to test any of the stuff that only buildall.sh builds, I need to test
it in a different build environment that produces horrible debug output.</p>

<p>The horrible debug output is because it has to be able to background a lot
of processes (to support FORK=1), and doing anything asynchronously makes
logging and flow control fundamentally harder.  Also, buildall shouldn't stop
the whole build script because one architecture fails, and you have to go out
of your way to make it build just _one_ architecture.</p>

<p>There are several ways I could address this.  I could teach build.sh to
handle the special case of building this extra stuff for the host architecture,
which is the one instance where you don't need two architectures because the
two match.  I could add the option to buildall.sh to die after the first
error.  But ideally, I want buildall.sh to stop blanking the temp directory
for later stages after earlier stages fail.</p>

<p>I taught the individual stages to exit when they haven't got their
prerequisites, and even added an option to suppress that error.  But they
still blank the temp directory from include.sh, before I can make specific
prerequisite tests.  Moving the cleanup out of common code to solve the
flow control issue would require me to duplicate it in every stage.  It
sucks either way, really.</p>

<p>The reason all all this is important is that the canadian cross
stuff (or an equivalent set of prerequisites) is required to do an
--enable-shared compiler, which is required to build uClibc++.  (It's an
unpleasant set of circular dependencies, based on the fact that libgcc_s.so
is a completely horrible idea.  The compiler should not add shared library
prerequisites to its output, especially not for a library that links against
libc.so.  It wouldn't have been so bad if --disable-shared built
libgcc_eh.a, but that would have been _smart_ and we're talking the gcc
developers here.)</p>

<p>It also turns out that the reason I've been having such trouble with
soft-float on arm is that they decided to add the soft float stuff to
libgcc_eh.a, so it only gets built for --enable-shared.  (I.E. the
--disable-shared compilers have been gradually crippled by the gcc developers
ever since the start of the 4.x series.  Wheee...)</p>

<p>The new kmail continues to deteriorate in the name of "helping".  Now
it's replacing _this_ with <u>this</u>, and I don't want it to, and there's
no way to switch it off that I can find in the config menus.</p>

<p>I continue to be annoyed by the perceived need to replace :) and similar
with a graphic of a smiley face.  I await software that replaces the word
"blue" with a color change and the word "house" with a picture of a house (or
perhaps a picture of Hugh Laurie, depending on context.  Yes, lord Percy Percy
from Black Adder got a lot smarter and more sarcastic and began walking with a
cane as he got older).</p>

<p>The hotel internet has melted down.  It was having dhcp issues (the lease
timeout is 4 days, well duh), each floor has its own router and it's not
always recognizing returning computers...  And now the whole thing's gone
catatonic and you can't even assign yourself an IP and ping the router
with it.  (You can still associate with the access point, but there's nothing
to ping.)</p>

everything with that, so I can beat soft-float out for armv4.</p>

<p>The mercurial git->hg converter is still broken (at least with the busybox

<p>And once again, buildall.sh is going "boing".  Sigh.  It's sad how brittle

<p>Since the mercurial git->hg converter Ubuntu 9.04 ships is toast, I'm
trying to build the current hg release from source, and install it.  I
did the standard "make" and it complained, you have to explicitly say
"make all" (which is stupid).  Then I did a make install and the result
couldn't find its libraries.  Ok, export PREFIX=/usr and make install...
and that doesn't work.  The mercurial makefile explitly sets PREFIX=/usr/local
so you have to override it on the make command line.  Ok...  And it still
can't find its libraries.</p>

<p>Ok, did it hardwire in a path?  Do I have to set the PREFIX before the
build and not just the install?  Try that...  Nope.</p>

<p>The build is dying because it can't find "asciidoc" to convert documentation
with.  It says that's optional, but the make is exiting with an error, perhaps
it didn't build those libraries because they come after that?  Ok, try
installing asciidoc...  And aptitude wants to install 36 packages to give
me that.  Sigh.  133 megabytes, decompressing to 277 megs.  Ok, on Central
Market's internet connection, this is going to take a while...</p>

<p>And _that_ wasn't it either.  Right, go look at the darn python path...</p>

<p>Ok, Mercurial installed it into /blah/blah/python2.6/site-packages,
and ubuntu has /blah/blah/python2.6/dist-packages.  Sheesh.  Symlink time.</p>

<p>Wow, the mercurial git->hg converter is kind of unpleasant.  I just
re-converted the busybox git archive, and the resulting
archive has commits in it twice, the log of commits isn't remotely
chronologically sorted, annotate shows that every line belongs to
the same commit...  The git user interface is horrible, but I'm not sure
a better UI into a fundamentally worse archive is an improvement.</p>

<p>Possibly I can write my own converter that won't suck?  (I wonder if I
can sort the commits by timestamp and apply them in that order?)</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that the archive has the files moving several
times, moving everything out of the "busybox" subdirectory up one level.
(Sounds like the initial svn->git conversion was broken.)</p>

<p>Oh wow, the repositories aren't the same.  I did an "hg update" to get
the most recent version of the files in the mercurial archive... and it bears
no resemblance at all to the ones in the git archive.  These are _years_
old.</p>

<p>Time to go grab the development version of mercurial, build it from source
myself, and then bother the mercurial developers if this is still happening
in the current release...</p>

<p>Sigh, in the meantime I need to work with git, so I have to go look at
<a href=/writing/git-quick.html>the git howto</a> I wrote where I worked
out how to do more or less everything I needed to.  (I removed it from
kernel.org because some idiot complained at length that the stuff I documented
wasn't the bits he'd have bothered to document, and I didn't feel like
arguing with him.  But I dug up a copy for my own use because _I_ still need
the thing, I donn't use it often enough to remember this stuff and the
documentation has that "elaborate yet impenetrable" quality of 1990's man
pages...</p>

<p>Random bug in VLC: if you enable deinterlace, it kills the old window and
pops up a new window.  The new window has no subtitles in it, you have to
disable subtitles and then re-enable them to get them back.</p>

<p>I'm used to Linux desktop software being buggy.  This is normal.</p>

<p>Broke down and set kmail back up, and caught up with the accumulated
week of back email.  (Mostly spam, of course.)</p>

<p>And kmail has lost the ability to thread messages in 9.04?  There used
to be a folder->thread messages option in the pulldown menus, and now it's
gone.  And I can't find any replacement.  That's just brilliant.</p>

<p>Reinstalling various things.  I have no idea why the "hg convert"
extension spontaneously disabled itself.  I had the "hgext.convert=" line
in my .hgrc, and it got commented out somehow.  Apparently, installing
mercurial from a dpkg goes through your existing .hgrc and comments out
extensions you have enabled.  That's deeply stupid; if I have an .hgrc
possibly the data in it _means_ something, eh?  Once again, Linux developers
are _sure_ they know what I want to do better than I do.  I need a mac.
(They're probably as arogant, but far more likely to actually have good UI
suggestions.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Looking at the busybox "patch" command to see what would be involved in
replacing it with the toybox one.  (Either as a patch I maintain locally,
or something I can push upstream to the busybox guys.)  Their version is
254 lines, and mine is 361 lines.  On the other hand, mine does a heck of
a lot of stuff theirs doesn't (starting with supporting offsets, which is
why I need it).</p>

<p>Ideally I'd make it config down to be as small as the old one, but it
wasn't really designed that way.  Hmmm...</p>

<p>Another thing is that after using the toybox infrastructure for a while,
the busybox infrastructure looks HILARIOUSLY clunky.  Put a prototype for

<p>So I found a new way to break toybox, and I don't want to put out yet
another single patch bugfix dot release.  If I don't want to bother with
it anymore, then I need to push stuff upstream into busybox.</p>

<p>I pretty much just need patch, oneit, and netcat.  I need my version of
patch, because the busybox one can't apply anything at an offset.  I need my
version of netcat because the one they've got doesn't seem to have working
-l support.  And I boot the resulting system under oneit, which I suppose
could be standalone.</p>

<p>The big part is that if I start working on busybox again, I'm going to have
a huge urge to clean stuff up...</p>

<p>I tried to build qemu from source, but the version of the source I had
died with a build break halfway through.  (I have horrible luck with random
source control snapshots, part of the "I break everything" schtick.)  So I
thought "ok, git update time"... except that it hung.  Why did it hang?
Because savannah.nongnu.org is down.  That was yesterday.  It's still down.</p>

<p>Luckily, the mailing list archive is still up (yeah, my personal email
still isn't reinstalled yet.  I need to break down and go back to kmail...)
and there's <a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2009-05/msg01471.html>good news</a>.
Now that the project has a new maintainer, not only did they migrate off cvs
but they may finally leave savannah as well.  Yay!</p>

<p>Yesterday visit to McDonalds has turned me off to The Donald's for a while,
not least because I had to move to the other side of the restaurant to get
away from the impressively intense smell of a homeless guy when I first
arrived (I could still smell him on the other side of the building, just
not as _much_).  Then a second homeless guy visited the bathroom three
times (passing right by me each time, and he didn't smell any better).
Then third guy struck up a nice conversation, which remained interesting
for almost ten minutes until he took the obligatory right turn into crazy
when I mentioned Warren Buffett and he started telling me how the bible
insisted nobody would ever be smarter than King Solomon and that some
Rozencrantz family secretly ruled the world.  (At which point I went
home.)</p>

<p>Today I'm at Big Bite, and their strategy for driving off homeless people
is the same as Jimmy Johns' (which was the same as Metro used to use): be
very, very loud to at least prevent them from sleeping in here after
midnight.  This one's a "sports bar" (a bit like Cain and Abel's), showing
a <strike>football</strike> basketball game on five different large
screen TVs.  I found a corner booth where I don't have to look at
any of 'em, but it's still loud enough that my noise cancelling headphones
aren't cutting it.</p>

<p>Attempting to listen to a podcast where Seannan McGuire (the lady whose
<a href=http://cadhla.livejournal.com>livejournal</a> I started following
after she wrote a marvelous Barry Ween fanfic) is interviewing Jenn
Brozek (the ex next door neighbor of Andy Weir, who wound up in his
<a href=http://caseyandandy.com>now completed webcomic</a> as an international
jewel thief with a time traveling daughter.  Both Jenn and Seanan are also
published science fiction authors.  Jenn's an editor.  Seanan's a
filker with several albums out, and draws an intermittent webcomic.
Interesting people, generally.</p>

<p>The two of them wound up at baycon together, and <a href=http://bayconpodcast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=483768>BayCon Podcast #4</a> is
Seanan interviewing Jenn.  It's a small internet, innit?</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, an interesting thing about VLC is its starting size
is the actual width and height of the source video, in pixels, with 1:1
scaling.  (The other players I've used just remembered the previous size
relative to the rest of the desktop.)  This makes it clear that the _reason_
Obama's podcasts look way the heck better than the msnbc ones is the white
house podcasts take up the whole desktop, and the msnbc ones are a tiny
little window in the corner.  (DVDs take up maybe about half the screen.)</p>

<p>Mark poked me last night about several FWL todo items, so I guess I should
tackle them...</p>

<p>Let's see, I got the nightly snapshots building with uClibc-git, I need to
test those to make sure they're all working, then upload 'em to the binaries
directory on uclibc.org.  Once I've got the those working, I need to figure
out which ones I can switch to nptl, probably adding new targets for those
(ala armv5l-nptl).</p>

<p>And I should really deal with sparc.  And I should switch over to gcc
4.2.1 as the stable version and make it always build libgcc_eh.a even when
it's --disable-shared (which would be a _better_ way to fix the arm soft
float issues, and also fix...</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>Ok, THAT was annoying.  The display froze.  The mouse still moved, and the
audio of the video I was watching continued to play, but the video itself was
frozen and nothing on the desktop responded to the mouse pointer or being
clicked on, the keyboard was dead (ignoring ctrl-alt-F1 and ctrl-alt-backspace),
and the power button didn't suspend.  Luckily, holding the power button down
for 10 seconds powered the sucker off, since that's not under Linux's
control.  And thus I was able to reboot.</p>

<p>That was crazy, the kernel was obviously still working because the audio
playback would have stopped if it wasn't (and the mouse would have stopped
moving), but all user I/O was frozen.  Why on earth did this get redesigned?
What idiot decided to route the power button (acpi event) and the desktop
(X11) through a single point of failure?  (Sounds like the darn "input
core".)</p>

<p>Great, now my laptop can choose to just hang on me at any time.  "Xubuntu
9.04: there are no nontechnical end users I hate enough to inflict it
upon."</p>

<p>I need to buy a mac.</p>
</span>

<p>On the bright side, the desktop icon for the bleach DVD has an "eject"
menu item if I right click on it, so I can workaround the fact the button on
the actual drive doesn't work.  (I note that the button on the drive was yet
another thing that caused no reaction from my frozen desktop before the last
reboot, but then if it had and the graphics were horked how would I know?
The mouse pointer is a hardware sprite, just like the commodore 64 used to
have...)</p>

<p>Sigh.  McDonalds has been having serious trouble with inflation eating
away at the "dollar menu".  At the start of the Bush administration, a dollar
was something like twice what it is now, and in 2007 and 2009 inflation was
double digits annually.  (It's slowed down quite a lot since the election,
although the banking crisis and resultant collapse of gas prices had something
to do with that.)</p>

<p>So a few months back, they replaced the double cheeseburger with the
"McDouble", which only had one slice of cheese but was otherwise the exact
same thing.  (And left the double cheeseburger on the menu at about 40
cents more, getting lots of people to order it and pay extra until they
noticed the change.)  But the McDouble is still a heck of a deal, and my
only complaint was the unannounced bait and switch.</p>

<p>But now they've screwed up the apple pies, and I am sad.  They've been
offering them 2 for a dollar for a while now, or 98 cents for one.  (I'm aware
this makes no sense.)  I'd be fine with dropping the two pies for a dollar
thing and the dollar item becoming a single pie.  But that's not what they
did, instead they took some of the filling out of each pie (not sure how
much, somewhere between a third and a half), making them look deflated and
bowed on the bottom, and screwing up the ratio between filling and crust so
they now taste like crust without enough apple in 'em.</p>

<p>Sigh.  They can't add 5 or 10 cents to the cost of the thing because a
dollar is a big psychological price point and it would no longer be a "dollar
menu" item so they'd lose an extremely successful marketing group.  But
quietly making the pie INEDIBLE is not a solution, people.  Grrr.</p>

<p>(I dunno, maybe I'm wrong and the last few times I've been into this
McDonalds every pie I've gotten is seriously dehydrated are something, in a
way that doesn't make the crust crunchy.  But it takes the fun out of
ordering the pies.)</p>

<p>Ooh, vlc does go forwards and backwards with the left and right cursor
keys, you just have to hold down shift, alt, or control to indicate whether
you want a 2 second, 9 second, or 1 minute jump.  (The hotkeys menu under
preferences list all of this.  So far I just remember shift and hit the
appropriate cursor key several times.)</p>

<p>Of course what I really want to do is find a way to tell it to lock the
aspect ratio on resize, so that when I grab the bottom right corner I don't

<p>So according to Wonkypedia (I.E. I wonder if it's true),
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T">the Model T could use
both gasoline and ethanol for fuel</a>, but ethanol was knocked out as a
viable fuel by prohibition.  So the dominance of gasoline as our current
automotive fuel is yet another side effect of prohibition.  (Makes you wonder

<p>One of the main failures of Xubuntu, or possibly Desktop Linux
in general, is that you can't easily pick and choose which apps you want to
run.  Yes, that "failures" and "can't" rather than "features" and "can".</p>

<p>Xubuntu comes with "movie player", which is actually a program
called "totem" although it never anywhere tells you that.  (You have
to use ps to see the name of the running process to figure that out,
and this is <a href=https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/totem/+bug/105685>intentional</a>.  That's a bit like saying "web browser"
and never revealing whether you're running IE, Firefox, Opera.
Did I mention the Gnome developers consistently make horrible user
interface decisions and then defend them to the death?  Why the xfce guys
are humoring the Gnome guys' poor decision making skills is an open
question...)</p>

<p>If you press the eject button on the dvd drive, it pops up a window
saying "Failed to eject "/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/storage_model_CDRWDVD_DW224EV",
and tells me that name is not a volume or drive.  I have to go to a
console and run "eject /dev/sr0" as root to get the disk back.  This
is unrelated breakage, it's because the "hardware abstraction layer" was a
horrible, horrible idea Linux copied from Windows NT (see Gnome == stupid,
above).  But I can't tell modern software _not_ to use it.</p>

<p>Totem is an inferior dvd player to Kaffeine, the one Kubuntu used
back in 8.04.  (So the rest of what I'm talking about is a regression
vs what they got working back in KDE 3, which was rendered useless
when they moved to the unusable KDE 4.)  Totem auto-launched when I
inserted a DVD (not even popping up a "what do you want to do" menu),
and then told me it couldn't access the dvd player.  Turned out to be
just a race condition, and on relaunch it accessed it fine.  (Kaffeine
did not have this race condition.)</p>

<p>Then it turns out that it doesn't seem to deinterlace the dvd
by default.  (Note I already went through the magic dance to get
decss support working, which is non-obvious and something the
mythical nontechnical Linux desktop users would have to phone a friend
to get to work.)  Google <a href=https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/totem/+question/15002>implies</a> that back under 7.04 you could find
a deinterlace option under the "view" menu, but there isn't one
there under xubuntu 9.04.  That menu has "fullscreen",
"fit window to movie", "zoom in", "zoom reset", "zoom out",
"aspect ratio", "switch angles", "show controls"
(the play button and such at the bottom, no deinterlace option
among them), "select text subtitles", subtitles (a sub-menu,
not only redundant but it isn't aware of the actual subtitles this
bleach disk has, which I navigated the DVD menu to switch on),
and "sidebar" (which is read-only, showing things like the duration,
resolution, and frame rate).  Kaffeine puts the duration as a label
ont he slider at the bottom.</p>

<p>Kaffeine not only had "interlace" actually as a labeled option
in the menus, but when I hit "i" it said it was toggling interlace.
I _think_ I enabled some kind of deinterlacing by pressing all the
letter keys in sequence (accidentally fullscreening and quitting and
such along the way), but A) it never notified me I was doing so,
so who knows what key it was, B) the deinterlacing algorithm it's
using is crap.  It's better than nothing, but still full of
artifacts.</p>

<p>Of course the problem with installing Kaffeine is it's bolted to
the KDE desktop, using the QT widget set and kobjects and so on.  We
have so many redundant implementations of exactly the same
infrastructure, and they're all slightly incompatible so can't be
substituted for each other.  It's like windows "dll hell", only built
into the OS.</p>

<p>So I tried installing "vlc", another dvd player that google recommended,
which presumably doesn't have these unnecessary dependencies on pieces of
infrastructure it shouldn't care about.  It installed fine.  It seems to play
the dvd.  But when I put in the dvd, totem still pops up.  I uninstalled the
package "totem", which made no difference.  There's 8 gazillion other
sub-packages (totem-common) and such, several of which imply it's tied into
the guts of mozilla.  (This seems odd since mozilla's using the binary-only
flash plugin to display essentially all video, because nothing else really
works.)  Ok, remove totem-common, let it randomly rip out three other
packages to "resolve dependencies"...</p>

<p>Ok, now it does nothing when I insert a disk, and I can pull
up vlc by hand from the menu to play the disk.  I can live with this.
(This has no menus, the whole window is displaying the video.  You right
click on it to get options, and video->deinterlace has seven options under
it.  It defaults to "disabled", yet even that seems to be deinterlacing the
picture slightly better than totem was.  I set it to "blend", although what
I really want is "just deinterlace properly, don't bother me with
implementation details since I'm not a DVD playback codec designer".
(This is a really common failing of Linux software, you have to know how
it's implemented in order to make it work.)</p>

<p>Except that with both kaffeine and totem I could use the cursor forward
and back keys to skip ahead or go back in the disk, and also get slider bar
along the bottom.  With vlc, I can jump to the start of episodes, and that's
it...  Ah, I see.  There's a progress bar on a separate window.  I guess
that's reasonable...</p>

<p>I still need to buy a mac, so I don't have this much upgrade hassle
every 6 months.  I have to make the "to kmail or not to kmail" decision
again, and until then I don't have an email client...</p>

<p>How do the ubuntu developers get stuff this simple wrong?</p>

<p>When I fire up totem and tell it to play a podcast, it says it
hasn't got the plugin and offers to search for it.  It comes up
with a window that says "GStreamer ffmpeg video plugin" and
"GStreamer plugins for mms, wavpack, quicktime, musepack".  Ok,
fine.  There's the pointless step of clicking checkboxes to select
them, which pops up a dialog about legal disclaimers (clicking a
checkbox should not pop up a dialog, that's horrible UI design),
and then I tell it install, it grinds for a bit, and then says
"Software installation failed".  It won't tell me what the problem
was, and there's no way to get extra information.  The three
buttons are "retry", "add/remove more software", and "close".</p>

<p>Oh, and did I mention it won't tell me the package _names_,
just the description fields?  If I want to do this from the
command line (and thus have at least a _chance_ of better error
messages), I have to figure out that "GStreamer ffmpeg video
plugin" is _probably_ the "gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg" package.
I still have no idea what the _second_ package is.</p>

<p>You could write a "user friendliness fail howto" out of this.
Automation that completely hides how the underlying thing works
is not useful if it means your car runs out of gas and it
refuses to say so (or even that gas is a thing it might ever

<p>So Xubuntu 9.04 is _almost_ usable.  But not quite.</p>

<p>My hard drive developed a bad sector yesterday (with the block remap
list full), so I took advantage of the extended warantee I bought and
had Fry's replace it.  Fresh hard drive, so I thought "might as well try
9.04".</p>

<p>Although the /etc/acpi scripts are all there, it doesn't seem like xfce
actually uses them.  Instead, I had to root around in applications->settings->power management->general to find a pulldown menu to change the behavior.
Ok, fine, I can live with that.  Except when it resumes, it asks me for a
password.  I don't want this, and a half an hour of searching leads me to
conclude the config menus haven't _got_ an entry for this.  So how do I turn
it off?
Google <a href=http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7174273>suggests</a>
that I install the gnome configuration editor (for xubuntu?!) and edit
apps->gnome-power-manager->lock.  Except that neither aptitude nor their
gui thing will install "gconf-editor".  The gui thing finds it, but then
says it's not supported on amd64.  (Brilliant.  What, I'm supposed to build
this from source?  I grepped in /etc/gconf for the word "power" and it wasn't
under there, so this apparently isn't a hand-editable .rc file.)</p>

<p>Ah, aptitude remove gnome-screensaver seems to have done the trick.
(Well, actually it left me with a totally black screen on the next resume
until I found and killed the gnome-screensaver process that was left running
after the uninstall.  But I found the thing to blow off with the shotgun.)</p>

<p>Oh yeah, "ready for the end user desktop".  That's Linux.  (I really
need to buy a macintosh.  I'm now using the _third_ most common desktop
because the other two suck too badly for words.  This one _mostly_ has
the advantage of simplicity, except when it doesn't.)</p>

<p>So to make xfce/xubuntu resume without a password, uninstall
gnome-screensaver and then killall gnome-screensaver or reboot.  Right.</p>

Plumber's conference attendees get a 30% discount... off of a $300 registration
fee.</p>

<p>That kind of discourages me from attending either one, to be honest.  If
Mark and I hadn't already submitted a talk proposal to the plumber's conference,
I wouldn't bother with it, and now I'm kind of hoping they turn us down.
(I'm a hobbyist, and they're double-dipping.  I've only ever bothered to
attend any of these things as a speaker.  I pay my $50 at the door for
things like Penguicon and armadillocon, but even the "discounted student price"
of $100 is more than I'd want to pay for a hobby thing.  I'm already spending
my own money to travel there, and for lodging.  If you don't know how to trade
a room block for function space you're not really a hobbyist event, are you?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if open source used to be the norm back in the 1960's and 70's, how did
this _change_?  Where did proprietary software come from, and when, and how?
How did Richard Stallman's little utopia at the MIT AI lab crumble and force
him out into the wilderness to try to rebuild it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two things changed in the early 80's: the exponentially growing installed
base of microcomputer hardware reached critical mass around 1980, and a legal
decision altered copyright law to cover binaries in 1983.</p>

<h3>Increasing volume: The microprocessor creates millions of identical computers</h3>

<p>The shortage of customers was changed by the microcomputer, which was
based on the microprocessor.  Intel invented the microprocessor around
1971 (largely by accident; here are interviews with the engineer who
<a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/intel/Hoff.html>designed</a> it,
the one who <a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/interviews/Faggin.html>implemented</a>,
the <a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/intel/shima.html>customer</a>
they did it for, and <a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/interviews/Moore.html>their boss</a> at the time</p> who is most widely known for having
a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law>law named after him</a>),
but it took Intel three revisions (4004, 8008, 8080) to come
up with a usable chip, which was at the heart of the MITS Altair, the first
microcomputer (and the <a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/cpm/history.html>original home of the S/100 bus and CP/M operating
system so widely cloned later</a>, including somewhat indirectly by the
IBM PC).</p>

<p>The first computer to sell 1 million units was Comodore's
<a href=http://oldcomputers.net/vic20.html>Vic 20</a>, introduced in 1981 and
beating the Apple II to the million unit mark by a few months.  So within
five years of the Apple II's introduction, you could potentially sell a million
copies of the same software.  This allowed the concept of "shrinkwrapped"
software to emerge, which you could write once and then sell many identical
copies of without even recompiling.  Initially this supported small companies
consisting of a programmer and perhaps a small support staff (<a href=http://www.wordplace.com/ap/ap_chap03.shtml>WordStar</a>,
Richard Gariott's "Alkabeth"), but exponential growth in the hardware market
led to matching growth in the potential software market.</p>

<p>The first "killer app" (a software program compelling enough to drive sales
of the system it runs on) was Visicalc, the first spreadsheet.  It was
produced by a two person company, Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston, operating
out of Bob's attic. The first version shipped
in <a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/apple2/implementingvisicalc.html>October 1979</a>, and was the main reason that Apple's less than 50k units
its first two years were followed by a million more.  (Another fun
quote in that article, by Bob Frankston: "it's worth noting
that back in 1979 people viewed the keyboard as an impediment to using
computers. After all, only secretaries could type...")  Oddly enough the
book <a href=http://www.variantpress.com/books/on-the-edge>"On the Edge"</a>,
which is about commodore, gives great behind the scenes information
on early Apple and Visicalc stuff.  The fact commodore bought the
company that made the processor inside early Apple machines has a little
to do with it, but mostly it was a darn small industry at the time
and everybody knew everybody else...</p>

<p>So the reason something like Visicalc couldn't happen before 1980 is there
was no customer base to sell shrinkwrapped software to, not even enough to
support individual programmers operating out of their bedrooms unless they
had a day job doing something else.  You could make a living as a
consultant writing bespoke software on commission, but your customers told
_you_ what to write, and owned the result which of course included the source
code.</p>

<p>The other thing about microprocessors is they were more uniform.  The
old "wire up a breadboard" computers weren't just produced in lower volume,
they were more easily modified at a fundamental level.</p>

<p>The MIT AI lab where Richard Stallman learned to program was started in the
1950's with a pair of prototype computers, built by a recent graduate named Ken
Olsen when he interned at Lincon Labs in Boston.  Both were unique, each the
only one of their kind ever built.  The first was the MTC (Memory Test
Computer), which only had only four instructions and was built for a single
purpose: to stress test early "core memory" and prove it could work reliably
under load.  The second was the TX-0 (Transistor Experiment 0), Ken Olsen's pet
project to prove that transistors could be made reliable enough to build
a computer and memory out of them.  (Early transistors were so sensitive to
static they were even less reliable than vacuum tubes, Olsen came up with a
way to buffer them so they could survive normal handling and operation.)
Both prototypes were heavily modified and upgraded by the students at MIT,
because although they weren't very powerful they
weren't shared, either.  Each belonged entirely to the AI lab 24/7, so the
students there didn't have to make an appointment to use it or get permission
to modify it.)</p>

<p>Olsen went on to found Digital Equipment Corporation to commercialize his
new transistor memory, and hired a bunch of his fellow MIT graduates to do so,
finding the most useful ones came from the AI lab that had received his
cast-off prototypes.  (The book "Hackers" by Steven Levy covers the founding
of the MIT AI lab.  This marvelous
<a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/interviews/olsen.html>interview
with Ken Olsen</a> covers the TX-0 from the Lincoln Labs end, plus early
transistor memory experiments, and goes on to chronicle the rise of DEC.)
The TX-0 was the only one of its kind, and when Olsen
founded DEC he hired a bunch of MIT graduates and sent one of the first PDP-1
systems to the MIT guys to train future graduates so he could hire them too.
(The MIT guys soon wrote the first shoot-em-up video game, "spacewar" for the
PDP-1, which became DEC's main sales tool for showing off the new system.
DEC <a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/dec/pdp8faq.html>eventually sold around 50 PDP-1 systems</a>.)</p>

<p>When DEC built its first mainframe (the PDP-6, they which shipped a total of
36 machines in its entire production run), MIT of course got one.  When DEC
upgraded the PDP-6 to the more powerful PDP-10 (about 700 total ever made),
MIT's system was upgraded.  That PDP-10 was the machine Richard Stallman
did all his work on at MIT.</p>

<p>All of these systems, from the TX-0 to the PDP-10, were heavily modified by
the MIT guys, to add new instructions and capabilities.  The fact that MIT
not only wrote its own operating system from scratch but customized its
computer hardware to add extra instructions and registers, really wasn't
that unusual under the circumstances; everybody did it back then.  The
computers were made by wiring together individual diodes and resistors and
such on a bread board.  Wiring in a few more wasn't a big deal.  But it
meant that programs written for a single machine ran _only_ on that machine,
or perhaps one or two others that had been similarly hand-modified.</p>

<p>Microprocessors were different in that you couldn't customize their
circuitry the way you could a breadboard full of chips and wires.  There
weren't just more of them but they were also more uniform, thus software
didn't need to be ported between different machines of the same model,
it could run out of the box.  That was something new.</p>

<p>Only with the arrival of millions of identical microcomputers, based on
mass-produced microprocessors instead of expensive hand-wired breadboards,
(see the books "Soul of a New Machine" and "A few good men from Univac" for
more descriptions of that era) could you write a program once and then sell the
exact same program to lots of different people without porting (or even
recompiling) it for each one of them.  That's why the software in the 1960's
and 1970's was either custom stuff individually comissioned from consultants,
or it was produced by hardware manufacturers in an attempt to sell their
hardware, or it was produced by the people who had the
computers for their own use, and shared through user groups like DECUS
and the <a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/cpm/cpmug.html>CP/M Users
Group Northwest</a>.  All this stuff came with source code.</p>

<p>But in 1980 Apple Inc. had a record-breaking IPO (the largest in history
at the time) based entirely on sales of the Apple II.  This triggered IBM to
rush out its own microcomputer (the IBM PC) in hopes of squashing Apple
before it grew too big to contain.  (That's an interesting story in its
own right, but a side track to the rise of proprietary software.  Robert
Cringely's book about it, "Accidental Empires", is fairly accessible and
was made into an even more accessable PBS documentary called "Triumph of the
Nerds".)  In 1982, "The Personal
Computer" was Time Magazine's Man of the Year.  Exponential growth
that continues long enough shakes the entire world.</p>

<h3>Changing the law: Apple v Franklin extends copyright to cover compiled/assembled binaries instead of just source code.</h3>

<p>The copyright issue changed in 1983, when the
<a href=http://www.internetlegal.com/impactof.htm>Apple v Franklin</a> ruling
extended copyright protections to binary code.  (The writing was on the wall
in that case over a year earlier, but the decision had to be upheld on appeal
before commercial interests could seriously act on it.)  Before that decision,
source code was copyrightable but binaries weren't, so companies shipped source
code to _increase_ their ownership of the code in the eyes of the law.  If
you just shipped precompiled binaries, you had no rights the law would
recognize.</p>

<p>The first real "voice in the wilderness" about proprietary
software was a kid named Bill Gates, with his 1976 <a href=http://www.blinkenlights.com/classiccmp/gateswhine.html>"letter to hobbyists"</a>.
Except that nobody took it seriously.  (Richard Stallman
<a href=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/195096/stallman_want_freedom_don_t_follow_linus_torvalds>claims not to have even heard
about it at the time</a>.)  People only listened at the time because MITS
paid to run the letter in a dozen magazines, and he wrote the letter because
the world _wasn't_ like he was describing, like he wanted it to be so he
could profit from it.</p>

<p>William H. Gates III ("Trey" to his friends) was a rich kid and the son of
a lawyer who dropped out of Harvard (pre-law) to start a software company with
a techie friend of his (Paul Allen).  Gates's Micro-soft was founded (in 1975)
in hopes of not merely selling software to the emerging microcomputer market,
but explicitly cornering that market.  Except that their tiny company could
only afford starvation wages, to the point that both of its co-founders,
Paul Allen and Bill Gates,
<a href=http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2006/pulpit_20060330_000890.html>took
day jobs at their main client, MITS</a> for the first few years of the
company, and their third employee (the guy their "letter to hobbyists"
credits with actually writing Altair BASIC, although their official history
now differs), was a part-timer they had to lay off.</p>

<p>They referred to their strategy companies as "riding the bear", attaching
themselves like a remora onto one dominant hardware manufacturer after another,
grabbing the software crumbs falling from that hardware market and switching
to the next when it lost its position.  First they rode the Altair's
manufacturer MITS, then switched to Tandy as their meal ticket when MITS went
under.  Finally they landed a lucrative contract with IBM (because Gates'
mother was on the board of directors of the Red Cross with IBM's CEO and
thus IBM could do business with "Mary's Boy" even though IBM wouldn't
ordinarily approve such a tiny company as a vendor because it might not
stay in business long enough to complete the contract; see the book "Big
Blues" for details).  Along the way, they sold their software (mostly BASIC)
to Commodore and eery other company that would buy it.</p>

<p>Ironically, the first software product of micro-soft was Basic (a language
developed at Dartmouth college in 1964 and freely appropriated by micro-soft).
Because it was the only high level programming language MITS offered for
the Altair, it quickly became the lingua franca of early 8-bit microcomputers,
starting with the Altair clones from companies like Imsai but spreading to
the Comodore 64 and Apple II and even IBM's PC.  The thing about Basic is
it was an interpreted language, where the source code _was_ the program
and you ran it directly.  Books and magazines distributed BASIC programs
by printing source code could type into your own computer.  Again, all
code written in early 8-bit BASIC was open source, because _not_ being open
siply wasn't an option.  The language itself enforced it.</p>

<p>Gates was the type of person to not only see a market opportunity in
bottled water, but then consider drinkable tap water as a threat to his
business and respond by trying to make tap water undrinkable.</p>

<p>In his 1976 letter to hobbyists, Gates was incensed that microcomputer users
mostly wrote their own software, and shared their programs freely with others.
Users saw Gates as the type of person to not only see a market opportunity in
bottled water, but then consider drinkable tap water as a threat to his
business and complain about it.  Back in 1976, he wasn't laughed off the
stage: he was completely ignored.</p>

<p>It's a bit like the recent <a href=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1877191,00.html>Time magazine article about how newspapers must start
charging for online content</a> by a guy named Walter Isaacson.  It's
considered a <a href=http://industry.bnet.com/media/1000907/the-problems-with-walter-isaacsons-newspaper-rescue-plan/>laughable</a> <a href=http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/>idea</a> today,
when the norm for internet content is free access.  But if that changes,
Isaacson will look like a prophet.</p>

<p>What users didn't expect in 1976 was that Gates and others like him would
respond not only with FUD (such as "shrinkwrap licenses" which were laughably
unenforceable at the time) but by trying to change the law.  Apple's 1980 IPO
attracted Wall Street's attention to the booming computer industry, the
sharks smelled money in the water, and proprietary interests have lobbied
continuously to change the law for their own financial gain ever since.
(Note it's still ongoing: the software patents blowup happened in the 1990's,
and the Digital Millenium Copyright Act at least claimed
to make shrinkwrap licenses enforceable in 1999.
Today Rupert Murdoch (owner of Faux News)
<a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/may/07/rupert-murdoch-charging-websites/print>is trying to implement Isaacson's ideas</a>.)</p>

<p>The thing about Gates is repeated failure didn't discourage him.
Here's a 1980 phone interview with a young Bill Gates (<a href=http://127.0.0.1/history/mirror/ms/gates.mp3>audio</a>,
<a href=http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/01/20/1316236&mode=thread>transcript</a>,
<a href=http://maltedmedia.com/books/papers/sf-gates.html>context</a>)
who was incensed that a recently published book about TRS-80 programming had
printed an annotated dissassembly of the TRS-80 ROMs, so hobbyists could
understand their machines better.  Gates insisted those roms were his property,
and nobody else had the right to look at them (let alone print out annotated
disassembly and sell it for profit), and he lobbied congress to that effect.
The entire interview is Gates talking about his attempts to change copyright
law, back in 1980, into what he wanted it to be.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Microsoft belatedly noticed the internet in 1995, it tried
to replace it with MSN, the Microsoft Network.  (Remember that in Windows 95,
the "unremovable" icon wasn't Internet Explorer, <a href=http://www.around.com/microsoft.html>it was MSN</a>.  When that strategy didn't work, they bought
a browser called Spyglass and renamed it Internet Explorer and made
_that_ the unremovable icon, in a second slightly more successful effort to
at least partially de-commoditize the internet.)</p>

<p>But back in the early 80's, it wasn't Microsoft that succeeded in changing
the law, it was Apple.  The Apple v Franklin lawsuit was Apple's response to a
company (which became Franklin Ace, makers of the Speak-N-Spell) that cloned
the Apple II.  Franklin's computers ran Apple software, and they used Apple's
ROM code verbatim in their competing product in order to do that.  The courts
decided that Franklin had gone too far, and that copyright must extend to
cover binary code to prevent that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Part of the reason AT&amp;T agreed to be broken up in 1983 (implemented in
1984, but agreed to in 1983) was to get out from under the antitrust regulation
imposed on it by a 1956 consent decree, forbidding it from entering any other
business beyond its telecommunications monopoly.  It nominally owned Unix, by
then a widely used operating system, but couldn't enter the booming computer
industry as a heavily regulated telephone monopoly.  When Unix first leaked
out of Bell Labs in 1973, there was nothing to commercialize because there
was no market.  In between, the computer industry _changed_.  Unix was
open source from day 1, and developed a vibrant community in the 1970's based
on this.  (It didn't have a name for open source because it didn't need one,
there wasn't any non-open-source software to speak of.  When copyright
first became an issue for software, the term commonly used for unencumbered
software was "public domain".)  When AT&amp;T suddenly
started enforcing its newly acquired copyrights, and charging _extra_
for source code, it was an enormous shocking change.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T wasn't alone in this, of course.  <a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/ibm/oco.html>IBM's
Object Code Only (OCO) policy</a> was announced February 8, 1983
(<a href=http://www.itworld.com/print/36427>more on this</a>), but
software predating that commonly came with source code, and often even that
source wasn't copyrighted.  This is why the Hercules S/370 emulator has
<a href=http://www.ibiblio.org/jmaynard/>plenty of old public domain software</a>
to run, including things like <a href=http://www.jaymoseley.com/hercules/installmvs/instmvs1.htm>the MVS operating system</a> (<a href=http://cbttape.org/~jmorrison/mvs38j/>see also here</a>).  Yes, even IBM's mainframe operating systems
worked by different rules back in the 1970's.</p>

<p>RMS tells his own story (<a href=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/stallman-kth.html>in his own words</a>, href=http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html>biographical version</a>) about a Xerox printer he couldn't get the
driver source to.  This came as a shock to him because previously, giving
source code to any software was a matter of course.  The world was changing
under him, and he didn't like change.</p>

<p>So when Richard Stallman founded the FSF in 1983, the same year DOS 3.0
came out, he was reacting to the recent and ongoing rise of proprietary
software.  Microprocessors created an exponentially growing hardware market,
the Apple vs Franklin decision gave software authors vastly expanded copyright
powers, and a gold rush ensued (similar to the dot-com boom of the 90's)
that hired away all the "hackers" from the MIT AI lab to work in a pair of
start-up companies attempting to commercialize LISP.  While his fellow students
graduated and took jobs out in the booming commercial computer industry,
Stallman stayed in academia as a perpetual grad student, and hid away from
the problem as long as he could.</p>

<h3>Kicked out of the nest: cancellation of the Jupiter project obsoletes the PDP-10 at the heart of the MIT AI lab.</h3>

<p>The big change that forced Stallman out of his comfortable nest at the MIT
AI lab was the obsolescence of the operating system he used, which was tied
to specific hardware that was discontinued.</p>

<p>Over the course of three decades (1950's, 60's, and 70's), the MIT AI lab
upgraded from the tiny Memory Test Computer all the way to a PDP-10 mainframe,
keeping ahead of Moore's Law (which Gordon Moore first documented in
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law>1965</a>).  Just as
the PDP-6 became obsolete and was upgraded into the PDP-10,
the PDP-10 itself was over a decade old by 1980, and ripe for replacement.</p>

<p>To replace it, DEC prototyped a new machine called the "Jupiter project",
which was roughly compatible and would thus allow PDP-10 software to be easily
ported to the new system.  But there were only 700 PDP-10 systems ever
sold, and their newest computer (the VAX, an upgrade to the PDP-11) was selling
thousands of systems per _week_.</p>

<p>The VAX was completely incompatible with the PDP-10.  The PDP-10 (like the
PDP-6 before it) was a 36-bit machine with 6 bit bytes, the VAX (like the
PDP-11 before it) was a 16 bit machine with 8-bit bytes.  Porting assembly
software from one to the other essentially required a complete from-scratch
rewrite.</p>

<p>By 1980, Ken Olsen's DEC had now been producing and selling its own
computers for 2 decades, and could hire programmers
familiar with them from anywhere, so he no longer needed the MIT AI lab
as a source of labor.  The industry was standardizing on 8 bit systems and
leaving 6 bit systems behind, and the 700 customers with PDP-10 systems were
already a rounding error compared to the 600,000 PDP-11 systems eventually
sold, and the VAX looked to be even more successful.  Thus DEC decided to focus
on 16-bit systems, told its PDP-10 customers to migrade to a VAX instead, and
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10#Cancellation_and_influence>cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983</a>.</p>

<p>With the cancellation of Jupiter, the operating system the MIT guys
had written over the years, a giant pile of hand-coded assembly proudly named
the "Incompatible Timesharing System" (which gives you a good idea of the
AI lab's "hacker" culture), was now tied to a dying hardware architecture which
would not be upgraded.  The writing had been on the wall for years; no new
students had bothered to learn the obsolete ITS or PDP-10 programming for
a while, and the booming computer industry in Boston hired away the graduates
who had been maintaining ITS, until eventually Richard Stallman was the
last holdout clinging to the old ways as a perpetual grad student.  When MIT
announced they were retiring the now-obsolete and unmaintainable PDP-10/ITS
system, Stallman's carefully insulated little bubble of ivory tower academia
popped, forcing him to respond.</p>

<p>Richard Stallman is not and never was a visionary.  He's a reactionary
conservative trying to cling to the past, and when the rug was finally yanked
out from under him he set about rebuilding that past as best he could.
Some of the things he fought to preserve were indeed worth preserving, but
looking at him as any sort of guide to the future is ludicrous.  He's never
been about the future, except to warn against it.</p>

<p>There are of course more questions (why would an ITS guy switch to Unix,
why was the FSF as successful as it was, how do lisp and microkernels show
the dude is totally totally not a visionary, who _else_ was doing this,
and where did it all go wrong), but again they'll have to wait because
this is already long enough.</p>

<p>Fade and I met Mark at the insurance office on Far West this morning
(for a definition of morning that occurred after noon, but still), to
finally get health insurance through Impact Linux.  Apparently, getting
insurance for two employees and a spouse is collectively about twice as
expensive as getting insurance for three employees.  THIS MAKES NO SENSE.
(Yes, I'm sure there are actuarial tables involved, but it's still crazy.)</p>

<p>Wondering if hiring Fade to do some web design for us counts as gaming the

<p>Went swimming afterwards (Fade's new bathing suit continues to work),
and then finally painted over grafitti in the alley.  (They got it again
last weekend.  Watched three hispanic teenagers wander through the alley
the next day gleefully pointing out instances of grafitti I hadn't even noticed
to each other, and slap each other on the back, but of course that proves
nothing...)  The actual paint part for the Quatros parking wall went fine,
but I ran out of paint stripper for the wooden fence, telephone pole, and
dumpsters.  Need to get more...</p>

Atlantis up in orbit (linked from the whitehouse twitter).  Early on Obama
said "You've excited my 10 year old and my 7 year old", and I
decided tha twas about right.  After listening to a sitting president talk to
astronauts in space, I'm wondering if I can track down a similar mp3 of a
racecar driving cowboy talking to firefighters who are in the process of
fighting dinosaurs, just for comparison purposes to calibrate the "we have
cool jobs that kids want to grow up to do" level of this conversation.</p>

<p>Ooh, and <a href=https://twitter.com/whitehouse/status/1871367841>this

<p>So I wrestled with the design of the new qcc wrapper for a while, unsure
quite how I wanted to proceed, but now it's turning into a variant of ccwrap
that breaks down stages.  It calls cpp to do preprocessing (and that's the
stage that gets 

<p>The advantage of doing it this way is it both partitions the task nicely
(eliminating duplicate code, so multiple different stages have to understand
about library paths and such) but also lets me test against the existing
gcc stuff before I've built the new replacements.  (Writing a wrapper I
can't _test_ makes plugging in other functionality a real pain, because if
it doesn't work it's not immediately obvious _why_.  It's also no fun
preprocessing C code you can't compile, or building .o files you can't
link...)</p>

They've got a <a href=https://informalclasses.org/ic/resources/2009SummerCatalog.pdf>pdf version of the current catalog</a>.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>So I'm designing the top level "cc" wrapper to call cpp the -M options are all aspects of cpp, not cc1.  At the moment, I'm just trying to get it to call
all the gcc tools in order (cpp, cc1, as, ld, strip) without telling one of
the multi-function tools to do anything one of the single function tools can
do.  (So even though cc1 can preprocess, and ld can strip, I'm having the
specific tools that only do that do that.)</p>

<p>I'm also writing it to not pass on any option it doesn't understand, so
if I haven't immplemented support to grab "-M" then it'll barf when given
-M, instead of passing it on to cpp.</p>

<p>Then I can swap out this wrapper for the one in FWL and make sure it can
build the whole system, and maybe gentoo from scratch on top of it.</p>

<p>At some point in the future, I'll probably want to coalesce stuff back
together.  It's possible to implement the compiler as up to six processes
(cpp | cc1 | as | ld | strip, all called by cc) but passing preprocessed data from cpp to cc might not be a win vs just keeping each translated line in the
processor's cache and dealing with it immediately, and outputting assembly
source and then assembling it is _definitely_ slower than generating the
machine code directly (although the _capability_ is still needed to support
-S, which the kernel needs in order to create some of its header files).</p>

<p>But that's all future optimizations, which can at least wait until I get
around to actually implementing the code that needs to be optimized.  (I'm not
too worried about anybody calling cc1 directly, and if calling cpp directly
was particularly common Ubuntu wouldn't have split it out into its own
package which I've never needed to install to build anything I've tried.
Builds do call ld directly and expect it to strip, but that's a question
of outputting _less_ stuff.)</p>

<p>Still vaguely uninspired about programming.  Poking at qcc, but admittedly
somewhat listlessly.  (Currently Linux isn't seeming like a fun hobby at all;
I deleted my old git howto rather than defend it against some idiot who
insisted any portion he didn't understand needed to be removed from it.
Apparently "I don't understand what you're saying, not that I've actually
tried the technique you described to see if it worked" means "you must be
wrong".  *shrug*  Deleted the whole thing, which seemed easiest way to give
him what he was technically asking for.  There are at least three other git

<p>Followed Fade to the library this morning and got a book, Keith Olbermann's
"Truth and Consequences".  I was somewhat surprised he'd found the time to
write a book, but apparently it's mostly transcripts of his special comments
with introductions.  (About 2/3 of the way through now.)</p>

<p>Various other errands during the day.  Went out with Fade to buy a
bathing suit, hit a mall.</p>

<p>Up to DVD 5 in bleach, which is the one where they loose track of
astral form vs physical form.  (Or at least he spends most of an episode
with his body being doctored for wounds received as a soul reaper, despite
never having established the Matrix-like "your body makes it real".)</p>

<p>Not that this is the first series that's needed a continuity advisor.
(Red Dwarf's books tried to justify Lister having his appendix out twice, but
glosses over the fact that the first Joke Lister makes upon being revived is
"Three million years?  I've still got that library book!" and later in the
first season "I've never read... a book."  Yeah, it's a comedy and these
are jokes of opportunity, possibly self deprecating humor on Lister's part,
and the MST3K mantra certainly applies to most of the series.  Still...)</p>

<p>Bleach remains fun, when it doesn't go into DragonballZ territory.
(Watching people yell at each other for 10 minutes isn't fun, and these
people would do well to study the video game concept of "logarithmic
difficulty increase", although World of Warcraft has some similar funky
balance issues.  I can't be _too_ upset that individual members of the
strongest 10% of Soul Reaperdom could each slaughter the remaining 90%, so
why the heck are they sending _those_ guys out into the human world to fight
hollows?  If you stop and realize that a single Stormwind guard could solve
all of Westfall's problems in an afternoon, "it's required by the plot" is
really the only explanation required, or offered.</p>

<p>There are a few tricks to understanding the series.  They level by something
like an XP system (or as they say, "spiritual power increases fastest when the
soul is in danger"), but Ichigo's limit break is to level, so when he's almost
killed he goes "ding" on his next attack (which heals him out of limit break
territory).  Orihime's power is based on the Mythbusters Mantra: "I deny your
reality, and substitute my own" (which makes her potentially even more of a
walking deus ex machina than Ichigo, although she levels more slowly).  When
cornered and otherwise close to levelling, all of 'em do big long "bribe the
GM with a backstory solliloquy to get character development XP" to push
'em over the edge.  Don't expect to get any of the jokes, the entire cultural
background they're based on is different (although the ones parodying other
anime series/tropes you at least have a chance on).</p>

<p>Currently watching the episode where Protagonist Boy regains soul-reaper-dom
after starting his <strike>heartless</strike> hollow transformation.  His limit
break kicked in and screwed up the cutscene, and he wound up with the "hollow"
and "soul reaper" flags both set. :)</p>

<span id=programming> 
<p>So I'm writing a fresh implementation of ccwrap.c for qcc,
<p>Wow the gcc option parsing is crap.  -static and --static do the same
thing, "gcc -cv hello.c" says that -cv is an unrecognized option but
"gcc -c -v hello.c" is just fine...  "-Lpath and -L path" are synonyms,
but "-lpthread" and "-l pthread" are not...<p>

<p>Rather a lot of "hmmm" moments.  I'm starting by reading ccwrap.c and
writing a new front end "qcc" command line interpreter, which creates
appropraite command lines to call cpp, cc1, as, and ld as necessary.
(This means none of those commands need to know about standard paths for
include files or libraries.)  Note that the existing ccwrap.c calls the gcc
front-end which does a lot of command line rewriting of its own.  This is a
harder problem, breaking up the command into stages and calling the
sub-commands directly.  Another issue is whether or not those sub-commands
should ever call each other, or whether the way they're called should
string together "cpp | cc1 | as" manually.</p>

<p>The issue I'm facing right now is since none of those sub-commands deal
with standard includes or standard libraries, it seems silly to feed them
--nostdinc and --nostdlib.  (The qcc versions won't _have_ the logic for
that stuff.)  But the gcc version of cc1 does do that unless called in such a
way that they don't have anything to do, whigh gets us bac to the
"cpp | cc1 | as > out.o" thing.  (On the bright side, that would distribute
the work over more processors on smp systems.  Is there enough work in
preprocessing for this to have any benefit?  The existence of ccache implies
so.  But the communications overhead might make it a net loss anyway.  It's
easy to program and keep it nicely modular, but it's not that hard to
keep it in one process, either...)</p>

<p>Anyway, from command line option parsing standpoint, cpp needs to
understand "-D -U -I -o -M* -d* -nostdinc" (and possibly also "-include
-iprefix -withprefix -system"). And ld needs all the stuff from
"-static -shared -L -l -Wl," and such.  So presumably if qcc is dispatching
right, the cc1 command line parser doesn't need to know about either...</p>

<p>The question is, of course, how to come up with command lines that gcc
would understand, which don't require the same code to be written twice
in qcc, and which doesn't impose unpleasant communication overhead between
processes.  (Partitioning the task!  A design issue...)</p>

<p>Lunch with Mark, who pointed out a couple of obvious bugs in FWL so I
could fix 'em.  (Canadian cross broke the ability to override CROSS_TARGET.
Ah.  Fixed now, I think.  And I need an /etc symlink to /usr/etc because
putting /etc/resolv.conf in sources/native winds up adding /usr/etc/resolv.conf
(or /tools/etc/resolv.conf with a different config).</p>

<p>The PPC board cisco sent him has a dead debug adapter (maybe another
bent prong?  Hardware problem, not my area...) and although qemu has a bamboo
board emulation what it doesn't have is a ppc 440 processor emulation.  I
tried to walk him through how to tweak qemu to possibly get the bamboo board
to do _something_ (plug in a ppc 405 processor emulation, which is a bit like
plugging a 386 into a 16-bit PC, but it should run 440 software).  But it
turns out it's not loading the device tree blob properly, which means I have
no idea how anybody's ever managed to use the bamboo board emulation to do
anything.  He said he'd ask on the list...</p>

<p>Walked home from up near Mark's.  Six hours of walking.  I'm out of
shape.</p>

<p>Got a design document posted to the qcc mailing list.  It's rambling and
a bit incoherent in places, but it's a start.</p>

<p>I asked Mark to create a new
<a href=http://lists.impactlinux.com/listinfo.cgi/qcc-impactlinux.com>qcc list</a>
so I can post design documents and such from the new project.  Have not
yet posted such a design document, but wrote a longish notes file yesterday.</p>

<p>Currently frowning at ccwrap.c and rewriting it from scratch in preparation
of slotting the options.c material into place.  There needs to be a cc
applet that rewrites the command line (so "cc hello.c" becomes a much longer
command line with -I and -L entries and mentions of crt1.o and such) and then
calls a cc1 applet that does actual compiler thingies.  But whether it
should literally create a new command line and call another main function
with its own command line parser, or whether it should just set up data
structures internally which the other command line parser could also do,
is an open question.  (Leaning towards the first.  Simplicity vs code
duplication is one of those tradeoffs that makes you want to step back and
think about the problem at a higher level because there should be a way to
get them to not fight like that...)</p>

<p>Part of it is "should this wrapper still be able to call out to an external
compiler, ala gcc?"  The current wrapper tweaks $PATH because gcc won't be
able to find its own sub-commands otherwise, which clearly _isn't_ required for
a qcc thing calling another applet internally via a busybox built-in
command style multiplexer pseudo-exec.  But if the other 90% of it _does_
work that way, is losing that functionality good?  (Especially if I'm going to
be writing low hanging fruit like ld and ar and such first, and possibly
handing off to some other cc for test purposes...)</p>

<p>Another thing is that ccwrap.c has c++ support, and qcc doesn't (and
probably won't any time soon, since tinycc never did).  If it's doing c++,
it needs to call out to an external c++ compiler.  (At least something like
cfront.)</p>

<p>Eh, worry about it when I've got more code written...</p>

<p>Twitter is down for maintenance.  (Fidget.  Fidget.)</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>I admit the #fixreplies thing is an impressive #twitfail.  They
spun it as a user interface improvement, except that it used to
be a configurable setting which already defaulted to "off".  They removed
the _option_, with no warning, and <a href=http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/small-settings-update.html>called it a UI improvement</a>.
That's what we call rolling a crit-fail on your intelligence check:
When you have <a href=http://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/1784963372>Neil
Gaiman retweeting Stephen Fry</a> pointing to an article about how
stupid your policy is (both of those people are in the 10 most followed
twitterers list), you have officially screwed up.</p>

<p>It turns out that the change was due to
<a href=http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/whoa-feedback.html>technical
limitation</a> in the database scalability or some such (which means they
can't put it _back_ easily), which in some ways makes it worse.  This was
actually a _marketing_ crit fail.  If they'd said at the start "we had to yank
it because it didn't scale, the code's unmaintainable or it bogs the servers,
we're working on a new implementation", that's one thing.  But the actual
quote from their "small-settings-update" announcement was, "Today's update
removes this undesirable and confusing option."  I never even _used_ the option
that was removed, so my config hasn't been affected by this, and I'm still
kind of annoyed at being patronized like that.  I don't want them fiddling
with the UI "for my own good", nor do I want them insisting they know how I'd
prefer to use their service better than I do.  They earned the wall of flame
coming back at them right now.</p>

<p>They've been <a href=http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/we-learned-lot.html>dancing
around an apology</a> ever since, but have yet to actually do a Mea Cupla
for treating their users like idiots.  Nor have they promised not to crash
around like tone-deaf elephants in future, perturbing the UI of a service
millions of people use with no warning or beta test site.  That's an easy
way to get millions of people to find or set up other microblogging sites,
which would mean I'd need an rss aggregator to follow microblogs.  Once
upon a time, the livejournal friends list was all you needed.  Now as
Jeph Jaques <a href=http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1403>says</a>,
"Can you believe people still have Livejournals?"</p>

<p>It's inevitable that the idea of microblogging diffuse beyond a single
website, the way free website hosting isn't just "geocities" anymore and
free blog hosting no longer means "livejournal".  In a lot of ways livejournal
was doomed by RSS aggregation.  But right now, there _isn't_ a way to do
@replies across sites, and until we come up with one and spam-proof it,
twitter still has a structural advantage.  But making their entire userbase
see them as poor custodians of the service they use probably just shortened
their time of dominance by about a year.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, I'm trying to remember when reading Linux Weekly News became a
chore.  About a year ago, I think.  My <a href="#09-05-2009">May 9th entry</a>
isn't a sudden development, more a buildup of annoyance leading to a
narrowing of interests (or at least avoiding the bits I don't want to
deal with), which isn't healthy long-term.  Life's too short to spend
it doing things that aren't fun (at least more than necessary to get back
to the fun bits; yay delayed gratification but not 40 years worth).
But I used to read linux-kernel and lwn.net for fun.</p>

<p>Sigh.  I've done this before.  I need a project.  I get enthusiastic about
_projects_, not about abstract technologies.  I'm still banging at qcc but
it hasn't "caught" yet (mostly because I'm still in the research phase
instead of writing code).  FWL isn't quite a chore yet but "stuck with
gcc 4.2.1" and "caught between busybox/toybox" are a couple largeish design
flaws...</p>

<p>Reading the tinycc source, collecting bits easy to yank for qcc.  Got
curious and browsed alloca.S.  Wow, I need to brush up on my assembly.</p>

<p>I was a bit confused why "alloca.S" didn't compile from the command line,
but then I wandered through the makefile and noticed there's no rule to build
it.  So I looked at the git version of tcc-grischka, and although they've
got an alloca.S there too _it_ never gets compiled either.</p>

<p>So my original plan of "tweak and test build" to see if I can "pop %eax"
instead of "pop %ecx" then "move %ecx,%eax" and so on...  Kind off derailed
by the fact that the original code I'm reading doesn't work, and the last
time I actually tried to _author_ x86 assembly code (rather than figure out
what debugger output is doing wrong) was... 1994, I think?  Yeah, time to
brush up...</p>

<p>(Hence my desire to get online and download an x86 assembly tutorial.
I've got books on it at home, just not with me.  And a reference != a
tutorial...)</p>

<p>Oh _that's_ cute.  Although gcc won't compile alloca.S, tinycc itself
_will_.  Ok, at some point I need to figure out what's wrong here, but

<p>Why am I *ahem* "not a fan" of the FSF?  Ok, I'll explain.</p>

<p>I'm not sure you can be a computer historian and not hate the Free Software
Foundation, because they're not who they say they are, they claim credit for
things other people did, and these days their agenda has become
counterproductive and harmful.</p>

<h3>A revolution to preserve the status quo</h3>

<p>The US was founded by revolutionaries, hence the name "Revolutionary War".
The founding fathers tried out all sorts of new ideas, and often took multiple
attempts to get it right; replacing the articles of the confederation with the
constitution, then adding a big batch of amendments to the consitution in the
bill of rights, swapping in the electoral college when the first method blew
up in their faces, going back and forth about whether or not to have a central
bank, eventually needing a civil war to finally resolve the whole slavery
issue...)  The US founding fathers would be the _first_ to say they were
imperfect people just doing the best they could.</p>

<p>These days, the founding fathers are primarily invoked by
ultra-conservatives, often while fighting against things like desegregation,
women's rights, gay marraige, bikinis, and so on.  They're about as far
from revolutionaries as you can get.  (As
<a href=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/conservatism_is_the_blind_and_fear-filled_worship/189997.html>Mark Twain</a> said,
"Conservatism is the blind and fear-filled worship of dead radicals".)
If you couldn't do it in their grandfather's day, you shouldn't be able to do
it now (so throw out that cell phone and don't use antibiotics).  You wouldn't
think this attitude would come up much in the computer industry, but human
nature is the same everywhere, and thus we have the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>The main reason I can't stand the FSF is they're ultra-conservatives
masquerading as revolutionaries.  While that's always a possibility when "the
revolution" drags on for 30 years and the ideals they're fighting for fossilize
in their proponents heads, that's not what happened here.  The FSF actually
started that way.</p>

<p>The FSF was <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/net.unix-wizards/msg/4dadd63a976019d7>founded</a> as a conservative
reactionary movement.  Back in 1983 Stallman's goal was to stop (or at least
personally avoid) the rise of the brand new proprietary software industry, and
return to the glory days of the 1970's.</p>

<p>Whether or not a return to the past was a _good_ goal is a separate issue;
there was nothing visionary about attempting to roll back the clock, so the
people who see RMS as a "visionary" today are _badly_ misinformed.  He is not
a visionary leader, he was taking us back where we'd already _been_.  If
anything this makes him _less_ qualified to predict the future, because his
most conspicuous trait is that he doesn't like change.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't stop him from trying to predict the future,
proclaiming <a href=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html>dire warnings</a> about it,
and <a href=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/195096/stallman_want_freedom_don_t_follow_linus_torvalds?pp=3>attacking others</a> who have a different
ideas about what's ahead.  Nor does it prevent
hordes of impressed followers (who don't know anything about computer history
and think this future/past he's describing is great) from hanging on his every
word.</p>

<h3>Before there was a proprietary software industry, 1939-1979</h3>

<p>So why is "free software" older than proprietary software?  The proprietary
software industry didn't exist back in the 60's and 70's for two reasons:</p>

<p>First, until the early 80's there wasn't a critical mass of customers to
sell proprietary software to.</p>

<p>The MIT AI lab where Richard Stallman learned to program was started with a
computer called the TX-0, a unique system built as a prototype by Ken Olsen,
the guy who went on to found Digital Equipment Corporation.  (The book
"Hackers" by Steven Levy covers this in a lot of detail, as does this marvelous
<a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/interviews/olsen.html>interview
with Ken Olsen</a>.)  That was followed with a DEC PDP-6 mainframe, which
the <a href=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/pdp8/>shipped a total of
23 machines in its entire production run</a>.  The lab was later upgraded
to a PDP-10, of which about 700 total ever made.  The fact that MIT modified
its computers to add extra instructions and wrote its own operating system
from scratch really wasn't that unusual under the circumstances;
programs written for early mainframes and minicomputers often wouldn't run on
any other machine in the world even if they hadn't been modified by their
users, simply because their component selection and configuration was
unique.</p>

<p>For most of the 1970's, the best-selling computer in the world was
<a href=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/pdp8/>the PDP 8</a>, which was introduced in 1965 and sold a grand total of
50,000 units during its entire production run.  The PDP8 was displaced as
bestseller by the Apple II, which
was <a href=http://www.applematters.com/article/april-17-1977-apple-ii-introduced/>introduced 1977</a> and over the next two years
sold a combined total of <a href=http://www.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/1999/rulemaker991119.htm>43,000 units</a>.
But that was enough to put it on top: in 1980, when Apple had its IPO, it had
50% market share of the computer industry (according to the PBS series
"Triumph of the Nerds").</p>

<p>So if you tried to sell "shrinkwrapped" binary software back in the 1970's,
the largest possible market you could hope for on any platform was _less_ than
50,000 copies, and even that's only if you targeted the most popular platform
in the world and somehow managed to sell a copy for every single computer of
that type ever produced.</p>

<p>The second reason the proprietary software industry didn't exist in
the 60's and 70's was that copyright law didn't cover compiled binaries.
Human readable source code was copyrightable (as an original work of
human authorship), but binaries produced by a compiler or assembler were
"just numbers", and the law didn't explicitly allow them to be copyrighted.
So if you wanted to claim any copyright on your program, you were _required_ to
ship source code.  Shipping source code gave someone _more_ control over
the result than just shipping a binary.</p>

<p>Thus publishing source code (with copyright notices) became official
policy throughout the computer industry (DEC, AT&amp;T, IBM)...  They actually
had fewer rights if they _didn't_ publish their source code.  (When Unix
came out in 1974  what was special about it wasn't that it came with source
code; that was normal.  What was special is that the source code was in
a high level language that minimized porting effort to move it from machine
to machine, instead of the assembly language all the other operating systems
were written in.)</p>

<p>Software in the 1960s and 1970s was either produced by hardware
manufacturers to help sell their hardware (who happily gave out the source
code, generally written in assembly language), or else it was produced by the
people who bought the computers for their own use (who had no incentive
to withold source code from _themselves_).  Users sometimes hired
consultants to a write custom software for them (in which case the source code
was one of the deliverables), but back then the only way to use a computer was
to learn how to program it, so users wrote most software themselves or had
someone on staff to do it for them.  The vast majority of software in the
1970's and earlier was written by the users, who naturally shared the results
through early user groups like DECUS and the
<a href=http://landley.net/history/mirror/cpm/cpmug.html>CP/M Users
Group Northwest</a>.</p>

<p>So how did this _change_?  Where did proprietary software come from,
and when, and how?  How did Richard Stallman's little utopia at the MIT AI
lab crumble and force him out into the wilderness to try to rebuild it?</p>

<p>I should probably hold off until next time for that.  This has gotten a
bit long. :)</p>

<p>Ok, I know what to do with my tinycc fork now. :)</p>

<p>The obvious way to replace gcc is with qcc, the QEMU C Compiler.  Take
tinycc, break it up the rest of the way, and slot it into the qemu source code
(in a qcc subdirectory) so it can build an "$ARCH-qcc" from each current
"qemu-$ARCH", using tcg (the Tiny Code Generator) as a backend.</p>

<p>I'd held off on gluing tcg to tinycc because forking tcg wouldn't be fun
(or productive).  It's still under active development, any changes I need to
make to it must go upstream or they'll become a maintenance nightmare.
Pushing the compiler front-end upstream into qemu makes noticeably more
sense, if they'll take it.  (But they already _do_ all the hard parts...)</p>

<p>Right now qemu application emulation can parse ELF executables and shared
libraries, so qcc's linker needs to use that code (and teach it to handle .o
and .a files).  So in addition to redoing the code generation backend,
the linker needs significant work to merge it into qemu.</p>

<p>I split my fork's option parsing logic off into its own file a year
ago, and I still need to do the swiss-army-executable thing on it and merge
it with the ccwrap.c in FWL.</p>

<p>That's a lot of work.  Trying to figure out what order to do stuff in...</p>

<p>Anyway, providing a decent replacement for gcc means the only GPLv3 piece
of software that actually matters is Samba, and the kernel has built in smb
client support so a simple server could probably be exported from that.
(It might not support Windows 95, but I can't really say I care.  Current samba
isn't exactly embedded code right now, is it?  Oh, and the dirty trick to
ignore all the case insensitivity issues: export a vfat filesystem. :)</p>

<p>Not quite back to my normal levels of enthusiasm (or at least bloody minded
<strike>stubborn</strike>vindictive problem solving), but any realistic chance
to rip out one of the foundations of the FSF's power base is always
invigorating.</p>

<p>Still apathetic about programming in general.</p>

<p>Linux on the desktop is dead.  Ubuntu 8.04 doesn't work with Netflix or
Hulu or Youtube's television options.  8.10 was a disaster.  And now 9.04
<a href=http://tinyurl.com/dbmbbj>doesn't work with Intel 3D</a>, not only
the most common one but the one that used to be recommended for use with
Linux.  Meanwhile, Apple's market share finally
<a href=http://www.tuaw.com/2009/01/02/apple-market-share-tops-10-windows-share-lowest-since-tracking/>hit double digits</a>.  (Whether or not Windows 7
sucking less than Vista counts as damning with faint praise or is actually
significant, I reserve judgement on.)</p>

<p>GPLv3 has fatally split the community.  The last GPLv2 version of gcc is
4.2.1 which is increasingly obsolete (doesn't do armv7 and up, meaning no
thumb 2), and there's still no replacement compiler.  Neither PCC nor
LLVM/Clang has turned into anything useful yet, and tinycc development is
just painful to watch.</p>

<p>Actually, tinycc development is _hilarious_ to watch in a black comedy way.
Grischka admitted that he didn't take most of my code because he
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2009-03/msg00026.html>didn't
understand it</a>, and now _three_years_ years later he's slowly reproducing
some of the <a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2009-04/msg00110.html>obvious</a>
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2009-04/msg00113.html>refactoring</a> I did literally back in <a href=http://landley.net/hg/tinycc/file/2365d90138f5/include/stddef.h>2006</a>.  At this rate it might only take him
3 more years to get to the point my fork was at when I abandoned it.</p>

<p>It's painful to go back to work on BusyBox both because of lingering Bruce
and because I like the toybox infrastructure so much better.  And there's
a lot of cleanup work to do, starting with removing the
<a href=http://sources.busybox.net/index.py/trunk/busybox/util-linux/mdev.c?r1=26127&r2=26156&diff_format=h>forest of #ifdefs littering the code now</a>.</p>

<p>But convincing people that conceptual bloat and what you can measure with
bloat-o-meter are not the same thing is exhausting.  (A wrapper script around
mdev is a better design decision than trying to shoehorn firmware loading
into something that wasn't meant to do that.  It's not mdev's job to do
every possible hotplug activity, and complicating the hell out of the config
file syntax is not the answer.  Also, removing the mmap config file parser
in favor of much slower and more complicated code that allocates memory for
each line of text in the config file (and then frees it again), and does this
again and again for every single device during "mdev -s"...  That was wrong.
I don't care if it's shared with other applets, it's still wrong.)</p>

<p>The reason for mdev in the first place was I disagreed with the design
of udev, and that there should be an obvious and simple way to do it.  I had
to fight the kernel guys (Greg KH and Kay Sievers) who thought
that sysfs was a private export and not a stable userspace API, so anybody
trying to write their own code to do this rather than using udev was obviously
crazy.  More recentlly I had to fight the kernel guys (pretty much Peter Anvin)
who are rewriting the kernel build system in perl.  In addition to not
needing an additional large prerequisite package which would rule out sane
languages like Python or Lua, perl is a specific programm, not a language.
It has no standard, merely a single implementation (just like Microsoft Word or
Microsoft Excel).  Whatever that implementation does is Perl, and it's
never successfully been reimplemented (despite the Perl 6 guys trying for
over a decade now).  That's not a language, that's a legacy hairball.</p>

<p>Sigh.  I feel like I'm fighting the entire Linux community, and I'm tired
of it.  Yeah, you can duck into the embedded world and avoid most of that,
but in a proper embedded system you don't care what it's running.  Might as
well be DOS.  The current most interesting embedded device (the iPhone) has
MacOS X.</p>

<p>When this laptop dies, maybe I'll buy a mac.  (About half the kernel
developers are already doing their kernel development on macs, from what
I can tell...)</p>

last night didn't have any commentary?)  As always, the correct response to
this sort of thing is to just grab the full version off of BitTorrent.</p>

<p>If Disney hadn't been gradually turning evil and senile for years,
this would probably be ignored.  After all, another disk we watched last
night (Master and Commander) has a
<a href=http://www.foxmovies.com.au/dvd/master-and-commander-special-edition-196/196/>special
edition</a> which Netflix doesn't carry.  But this reads as part of a pattern;
Disney is an evil money-grubbing entity trying to infinitely extend copyright
terms and so on, but they drove creative people like Katzenberg away (the guy
behind the run of movies from The Little Mermaid through The Lion King,
and now the K in Dreamworks SKG), and wound up having to buy Pixar to have any
new content anybody wants to see.</p>

<p>The Mouse has turned into The Godfather in his old age, but when his
"offer you can't refuse" is (according to the interminable previous on
the Lilo and Stitch disk) "The Jungle Book 2", "Return to Atlantis 2",
live action "Inspector Gadget 2", a live action "Berstein Bears" movie,
"101 dalmations 2"...  I think "out of ideas" happened back around the
"Peter Pan 2" movie (which wasn't direct to video, but should have been).
When I hear the word "disneyland" these days, the first thing that comes to
mind for me is that Blagejovich and his hair went there last month to
celebrate his indictment.  Six flags is way closer.</p>

<p>Much cleaning of the condo before Fade gets home.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Poked at build strace a bit in the evening.  This is a weird program.
Building natively under armv5l, it went:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
In file included from syscall.c:129:
linux/arm/syscallent.h:435:3: error: #error fix me
linux/arm/syscallent.h:457:3: error: #error fix me
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm guessing that strace 4.5.18 doesn't support the 2.6.29 kernel, at
least not on an arm host.  (Instead of failing by saying unknown syscall at
runtime, it fails by refusing to build.  That's nice.  I note that 4.5.18
is the most recent version on strace.sf.net and that page has no link
to a mailing list...)</p>

<p>The source code's README says:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
You can get the latest version of strace from its homepage at
http://www.liacs.nl/~wichert/strace/ .
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is 404 and according to archive.org has been since 2006.</p>

<p>I'm not sure "maintained" is a word that applies to this package.</p>

<p>Mark pointed out that the Gentoo guys have patches for this, and apparently
have for some time.  (Apparently there's been nobody upstream to send them
_to_?  Dunno.)  Oh well, yay it's fixed, moving on...</p>

<p>Poking at a dropbear build script under the native root filesystem for
a nightly cron job.  Alas, dropbear went to autoconf for some inexplicable
reason, so of course it sits there making stupid tests (very slowly):</p>
<blockquote><pre>
checking for gcc... gcc
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Yes, gcc is called gcc.  If you were checking for "cc" (the standard
name required by SUSv3; SUSv4 seems to require "c99" now), that might make
some of the later tests less silly.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes
</blockquote></pre>

<p>Um, why do you care, and what was the first test for, then?</p>

<blockquote><pre>
checking for C compiler default output file name... a.out
</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can specify -o all the time so this never matters.  Same with
suffix of executables and suffix of objects files, but you can also just
accept that there are exactly three interesting build platforms these
days (Linux, MacosX, Windows) and you're under no obligation to support
all of 'em anyway.)</p>

<blockquote><pre>
checking whether the C compiler works... yes
</pre></blockquote>

<p>During the build, you'll notice pretty quickly if it doesn't.  You'd
also get a better error message saying _why_.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes
</blockquote></pre>

<blockquote><pre>
checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
</pre></blockquote>

<p>A) This is required by the Single Unix Specification, B) there's
a gcc that doesn't accept -g?</p>

<blockquote><pre>
checking for gcc option to accept ISO C89... none needed
</blockquote></pre>

<p>Again, your very first test was for gcc, then an explicit "are you really
gcc and not another compiler pretending" (no idea why), and now it's doing
this kind of crazy stuff.</p.

<p>It just goes on and on like this.  But that's not the funny part.  Here's
the funny part:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
checking for deflate in -lz... no
configure: error: *** zlib missing - install first or check config.log ***
</pre></blockquote>

<p>You have to explicitly say --disable-zlib.  What exactly is the POINT
of running ./configure if you have to explicitly tell it on the command
line what your environment contains?</p>

<p>Of course when you do that it then goes on for a long time checking
"is the strip command called strip" and so on, explicitly checking whether
or not our C compiler has "memcpy"...  and then at the end it tells us to edit
options.h to select the options we want.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>Saw Fade off the airport for <a href=http://penguicon.org>Penguicon</a>.
(I'm not going this year, the con chair and I don't get along, it's probably
better for the event if I stay out of his hair while he's wearing the con
chair hat.)  I feel bad I won't get to hang out with Garrett and Christian
and Tracy and Heather and so on, but oh well.  Maybe next year.</p>
</span>

<p>Found my credit union debit card (jacket coat pocket, of course; things
always get lost there when it gets warm), which saved me a trip this
morning.

<p>Lunch with Stu and Beth at the Lakeline Mall.  Lasted until around 4,
much shooting of the breeze was perpetrated.  Went to Fry's to pick up
a TV input switch so we can hook up the Praystation, the Whee, and the
Ex-box to the same TV.  Looked at new TVs while there.  Did not buy one.</p>

<p>Read "No more dead dogs", which was good.  (I have a weakness for young
adult books; they spend less time trying to be "original" and more trying
to be _good_.)  Looked around the shelves for something else to read, decided
I wanted to read "A bad spell in Yurt", found book 5 in the series, book 4,
and then another copy of book 5, but no 1-3.  Collated bookshelves a lot.
(Most of our Terry Pratchett books are now in one place; they fill 2 shelves
and involve not just paperbacks but 4 different sizes of hardcover).</p>

<p>Trying the new "Big Bite" place on 24th street for dinner.  Not really
noteworthy except that it's theoretically open really late and has less
intrusive music than Jimmy John's.  (Half the time Jimmy Johns' music is
_good_, but it's too loud to hold a conversation and too loud for my noise
cancelling headphones to make a dent in.  Not a good work environment.  I
suppose that's the point.)</p>

<p>Alas, Big Bite only has diet Pepsi, which is like a hangover remedy designed
by Franz Kafka.  (It has not yet been featured in a "Steve, Don't Eat It!"
but I feel it should.)  Alas, they don't have diet mountain dew (the only
real excuse for the Pepsi product line).  Jimmy Johns is open until 3am
and has diet coke.  The Wendy's in Jester is open until 4am and has Coke
Zero.  The McDonald's is open until either 10 or 11 (it varies based on
ambient humidity) and has Diet Dr. Pepper and 2 apple pies for a dollar,
so I wind up going there rather a lot.</p>

<p>This is a truly uninspired burger.  I'm not sure how they managed to get
something this bland out of what seem like perfectly reasonable ingredients,
the texture of which suggests they were comptently prepared.  Hmmm...  Did
they put _any_ salt on it?  Nope, doesn't seem like they did.  The
mayonaise undermines the result a bit (maybe I made a mistake asking 'em to
hold the pickle, the mayo has nothing sharp to mute).  And I like big fluffy
soft bread but this bun doesn't go with this burger.  Too much squishy and
tasteless tomato (obviously picked rock hard green and allowed to ripen in a
warehouse).  The cheese is either mozarella or one of the blandest whitest
most tasteless american cheeses I've encountered, which is saying
something...</p>

<p>I'm not entirely surprised.  A place that advertizes 30 different types of
hamburger, pizzas, gyros, grilled chicken sandwiches, cheesesteaks, wings,
wraps, subs including eggplant or shrimp parmesan...  It _might_ just be
overextending itself and not do any of that particularly well.  But it was
worth a shot.  They'll probably pare down the menu in a few months.</p>

<p>And I must admit, the free internet makes up for a lot.</p>

<span id=smof>
<p>Ok, I know I'm weird, but I'd just _assumed_ the Penguicon guys had
a video link set up so Wil could address opening ceremonies (and
maybe even voip-phone in a panel or two) from home if <a href=http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2009/05/to-everyone-at-penguicon.html>he couldn't physically
make it to the con again</a>.  USB web cameras are what, $15 these days?
After a Red-sox-like streak had established itself, it just seemed like common
sense to me.  (Although I admit my money was on "meteor strike" this time.
And no, the third time isn't "hindsight".)</p>

<p>Rather than turn this into armchair quarterbacking, here's a Plan
For Getting Wil To A Future Penguicon.  (I don't know who future
Penguicon runners might want to invite, but in case they someday decide
to try again with Wil, and he's up for the abuse, here's how I'd go about
it.)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Step 1</b>: Go ahead and send Wil a cheap USB web camera, one that works
with macintosh laptops.  (This is a gift, he can keep it.  Also note that most
macs have one of these suckers built in.  Send him a spare _anyway_.)</p>

<p>Also send Wil a badge that says "Sir Not Appearing At This Con".  (Make him
promise he will wear it through the entire weekend of Penguicon, wherever he
happens to be during that time.  Demand pictures.  Yes, this will be his
badge if he does, by some fluke, wind up attending.  Ribbons for him to hand
out to Penguicon attendees, possibly by mail, are left as an exercise for the
reader.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Step 2</b>: Keep a second webcam on site in case Wil winds up bedridden
in his hotel room (or a local hospital) instead of bedridden at home, so he
can still occasionally say hi.  This has the added benefit that it could
potentially be used to record panels downstairs if it isn't otherwise needed.
(Hey, gotta plan for everything, even the possibility of success...)</P>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Step 3</b>: make a case for inviting him back a fourth time.  Start by
ripping the Monty Python and the Holy Grail clip about Swamp Castle, everything
from "They said I was daft building a castle in the swamp" through "but the
fooourrth one stayed oop!".  (It's short enough it probably falls under fair
use, especially with what we're going to do with it.)  Have Wil use his web
camera to record himself describing his first three attempts to get to
Penguicon.  Intercut the "burned down, fell over, and then sank into the
swamp" bits with Wil's description of his previous Penguicon weekends.  When
competed, post this video on the Penguicon web site.  (This will also be
played during opening ceremonies.  If necessary, use the corresponding scene
from Babylon 5 about the previous stations for the next attempt.)</p>

<p>Note that using the webcam for this rather than some other video camera
has the advantage of testing out the webcam to make sure it works and is
set up properly ahead of time.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Step 4</b>: Fly him in early.</p>

<p>The first few years of Penguicon we flew all Guests of Honor in on Thursday
wherever possible, so there was some failover in the plan.  This gave
the guests time to unwind, because "travel and perform the same day" is
hugely stressful (as those of us who ever travel for business know).  The
travel itself is also less stressful when you're _not_ on an immediate
deadline.  (Yeah spending an extra couple hours waiting after a missed
connection sucks, but there's no rush, you're not missing any panels, you
can relax.)</p>

<p>Given that this is a <strike>third</strike> fourth attempt, fly him in on
_Wednesday_, and arrange some local event for him for Thursday so he isn't
wasting his time.  (Reading/signing at a local bookstore or two, perhaps?
Is there a local radio program that interviews authors?  Or if Detroit has
anything at all like the Alamo Drafthouse he might want to introduce a special
showing of one of his movies.  It's a big city he doesn't get to much and
we're springing for the extra hotel room day, ask him for suggestions.  Maybe
he wants to go to the zoo; up to him.  The point is, it's ok to ask him to
allocate us a little more time as long as he can make good use of it.  I
believe Terry Pratchett used the extra time to sit quietly in his hotel room
and write the "you all meet in a tarvern" scene near the start of Monstrous
Regiment, which he read for us the next day one of his talks, and we were all
pretty happy with this arrangment...)</p>

<p>(The Thursday night dinners with just the GoHs and concom are a nice fringe
benefit of the "bring 'em in early" approach, but they're also entirely
optional.  I only ever actually made it to one of those myself, tended
to be busy a lot right before the con for some reason...)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Step 5</b>: Offer odds on the web page.  (Possibly Lloyds of
London could help here, I dunno how that works.)</p>

<p>Suspense!  Drama!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Step 6</b>: Recuit help.</p>

<p>Inviting Guests of Honor is always a question of getting good combinations
that would work well together; people who are already friends, or fans of
each other's work, or would go well on panels.  (This part worked well this
year, and Andrew Hackard stepped up to fill in for Wil.)</p>
</ul>

<p>None of this would have actually prevented him from getting sick, of
course.  But it would allow the whole process to fail in the most entertaining
possible manner.  :)</p>

<p>(Actually, It occurrs to me that the logical way to get Wil to a future
Penguicon is don't announce it.  Do it in secret.  Fly him in quietly, sneak
him into the hotel, and then have Ninjas carry him into opening
ceremonies (bound and gagged, if possible, and untie him on stage).
Schedule either "Robert Wesley" or "Stephen E. Whitfield" (various pen names
used in Star Trek) on Wil's panels and swap him in for those...
Somebody on twitter <a href=http://twitter.com/brian_carnell/statuses/1670428483>suggested</a> that we should
declare he's been reconned into previous Penguicons and that this is actually
his Xth appearance at the con...)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Eventually decided that building under emulation was the way to go after
all, even for three small packages.  For one thing, I'm not trying to get
strace to cross compile.  For another, it's nice to have a smoke test of
the build environment to catch things like the fact that the current
buildall.sh is leaving prefixes on the _native_ toolchain.  (Sigh.)</p>

<p>Nothing to say today.  Not dead.  Fed Mark's cats.  Did I do anything
of interest?  (Thinks...)</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Dealt with the mortgage guy.  Had to create a handwritten letter
confirming I'd transferred money from savings to checking within the same
account, which is at the same bank I applied to for a mortgage, then had to
sign and fax said letter.  It was an emergency, which will probably delay the
closing date, which would cause the sellers to walk since it's already been
delayed twice and the end of the month was a hard deadline for them.  I told
the mortgage guy, who then went on a rant about how he was doing me a favor
wasting his time on this small loan that they'll make no money on.</p>

<p>I think when I move out of this place, wherever we go next I'm going to try
to arrange to pay cash.  May take a while, but this whole mortgage thing just
isn't worth it.</p>

<a name="28-04-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#28-04-2009">April 28, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Grumpy today.  Didn't get enough sleep.</p>

<p>Ah Subway, home of the $5 footlong and the $4.86 6 inch sub.  The message
here isn't that their footlongs are a good deal, it's that everything else
on their menu is very inefficiently priced.</p>

<p>I miss the days when menus actually listed everything they sold and how
much it cost.  Apparently this is too "texty" for a modern audience.  I thought
McDonalds was bad ("Does that ice cream machine behind you still work?  So
where's the ice cream on the menu?"  They _rotated_ one of the signs until ice
cream showed up.  Oh yeah, I should have spotted that back inside the wall
somewhere, obviously.)  But the McDonalds menu is totally coherent compared
to Subway, which doesn't mention the existence of roast beef sandwiches, nor
the 6 inch option.  You have to remember them from years ago when the menu
did include them.  (Don't get me started on the "Fresh Fit" sub the kids meal
contains but which isn't mentioned anywhere else on the menu, nor the menu's
implication that Jared is the founder of Subway.)  And you wonder why I haven't
been here in most of a year?</p>

<p>Here now because it's next to the H&amp;R block location that's still
open after tax day, although that doesn't open for another 45 minutes.  More
paperwork for my sister's house, now they want a K1 form for
Impact Linux.  (Why?  It's a shell company with no assets, it passes
consulting money to Mark and myself and lets us buy health insurance
in a different way.  According to the K1 I finally got printed out, it had 81
dollars in it at the end of last year.  Half of which was mine, apparently.)</p>

<p>And they want everything handwritten and faxed.  (Because obviously you
can't fake a fax in photoshop, save it as a bmp, and send it out via a fax
modem.  Nobody has a fax modem anymore, and the software you'd need to drive
it runs under DOS which is a pain to set up the emulator for.)  I keep
having to fax things from Kinko's.  I've spent at least $200 on faxes so
far during this process.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>So I want to build static busybox, dropbear, and strace binaries for each
target.  This is easy to do; I can think of at least three different ways off
the top of my head.  It's so easy I can sit down and write a script to do this
with no references or research.  Which means it's one of those class of
problems where figuring out the _right_ way to do it makes my brain hurt and
I get writer's block for days.</p>

<p>I can just fire up the native build environment, wget the source,
untar it, cd into the new directory, make defconfig, make, and copy the
binary back out.  (Building dropbear first makes copying the binary back out
noticeably easier.)</p>

<p>In practice, the config I want to build isn't _quite_ an actual defconfig,
I <a href=/hg/firmware/raw-file/724/sources/trimconfig-busybox>switch a lot of
stuff off</a> that doesn't build on various targets (m68k hasn't got taskset)
or without strange host support (selinux is evil).  So I need to grab that
trimconfig file out of FWL, but I can wget it straight from that URL if I
like.  (Put "tip" in for the version number and it auto-updates.)  So I
don't quite need to grab the full FWL infrastructure, but it's not
entirely independent either.</p>

<p>Next, grabbing the dropbear source again every night is a bit impolite
to the download servers because it's not going to change that regularly.
Desite my desire for it to grow stunnel support, the project is mostly
complete and in maintenance mode.  The FWL infrastructure has cacheing
already; the download and setupfor functions handle this transparently.
So if I _do_ grab the FWL infrastructure, I get this pretty much for free.</p>

<p>I can also cross compile both of these packages, which is quick and easy
and ignores the whole point of the project (that building natively under
emulation is the way to go, and cross compiling is a transitional stage you
get through as quickly as possible).  But in each case, I've got a
package that's already set up to cross compile and which produces a single
static binary as its output, and the rest of the nightly cron job is
a cross compiling so I've already _got_ a cross compiling build environment
set up.  It's even got the FWL stuff sitting there ready to use, and if I
jump into the emulator I have to re-download FWL and set it back up if I
want to use it.</p>

<p>So there's a simple way to do this which has obvious flaws, and a more
complicated way to do this that probably isn't worth the complication,
and this is the kind of thing that makes my brain hurt.</p>

<p>There are some actual fiddly bits.  The download.sh script
deletes everything out of packages that it doesn't know about.  (This is to
automatically zap old versions of the packages after you upgrade download.sh.
It's actually a bit of a pain, because it means that things like qemu (which
are speculatively downloaded) or alt-packages (which are sometimes downloaded
and sometimes not) get deleted and then have to be re-downloaded, or else
are downloaded and kept around when they don't need to be.)</p>

<p>I don't want to add dropbear to download.sh to unconditionally download
it every time, and I'd like to move strace out too.  Have some kind of
cron.sh call download.sh stuff.  But then I have to use a different download
directory (not "packages") or the extra files will get wiped every time
the original download.sh script runs.  And the problem with _that_ is
that the original download.sh is already downloading busybox, and having
the second directory download a second copy of the busybox tarball is
kind of icky.</p>

<p>Did I mention that root-filesystem.sh already builds busybox, and
could easily be taught that BUILD_STATIC=1 applies to busybox?  Except
that it would build a lot of _other_ stuff (like uClibc), and would thus be an
inefficient way of building that one binary (unless I wanted to have all the
root filesystems it built be static), which I don't.  So this is either
going to be duplicated or is going to have too much fiddly configuration
shoehorned into it, and both suck.  Sigh...</p>

<p>Again, it's the _little_ things that screw me up.  The ones that don't
really _matter_ in the larger scheme of things, but are nevertheless _ugly_,
that I go round and round on...</p>

<p>Don't mind me, I'm having an aesthetic reaction to a simple problem.
FETCH THE CHAINSAW!</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>In a lot of ways programming is an art instead of a science.  Debugging,
especially.  "I don't know what it's doing wrong" is pretty much a requirement
for a bug: very few programmers intentionally write the code wrong, so
it's misbehaving either because what you wrote didn't match what you had in
your head or because what you had in your head didn't take something into
account.</p>

<p>An awful lot of reworking is because "no, this isn't right" without being
tied to a specific bug.  You redesign some bit to make it better (often
simpler and relying on fewer assumptions now that you understand which
parts are actually important), and as a result bugs you haven't
actually hit yet go away.  And then when somebody hits a bug in an older
version and ask you which patch fixed it you can't really answer because you
never saw that bug.  And sometimes "which patch fixed it" was a redesign,
where the memory leak went away when you switched to mmap(), or the bug
was in the translation module and now you've changed the other parts of
the program to all talk the same language so there isn't a translation
module anymore...</p>

<p>I bring this up because software suspend in Ubuntu 8.04 semi-regularly
corrupts the vfs cache if the filesystem is active when it suspends (such as
running a build that'll take another 15 minutes to complete and I don't want to
wait that long just now, but I don't want to abort the build either).
And I know the kernel in 8.10 didn't do that once in all the months I was
using it (which is why I forgot about the problem), but doing the Ubuntu
upgrades when I installed this laptop (at which point the release was
almost a year old) didn't fix the bug; the old kernel is still susceptible
to it.  Which patch along the way to the new kernel fixed it?  Probably not
that simple...</p>

<p>I wonder what's involved in getting a Gentoo desktop with kmail on an
xfce base and a working Flash plugin.  Highly _unlikely_ to be particularly
simple, but it's something I could much more easily tweak myself once I got it
that far...  (This is probably a bit like saying "It's hard to get a tank
platoon 200 miles behind enemy lines, but once you do things get much easier".)</p>

<p>Wait until Mark gets back to town.  Definitely.</p>

<p>So I'm fiddling with upgrading the system images to gigabit ethernet
(e1000).  I just did i686 and it's slightly faster, but not much.  Maybe
3.5 megabytes per second.  When I do a "dd if=/dev/zero of=blah bs=1M count=100"
and time it, it seems to be getting maybe 11 megabytes/second.  Hmmm,
when I do a wget of a 120 megabyte file and add "-O /dev/null" it also
gets about 11 megabytes/second.  Right, there's some sort of emulated
PCI bus contention going on.  Whee.  Still, sending stuff to/from distcc
might go faster now, which would be good.</p>

<p>Finally wrestled canadian cross building of static toolchains into
submission.  Lots of darn fiddly little things to get right (one of the
fiddlier, strangely enough, was making sure that the prefixes of everything
wound up in the right places.  For example, you can't get uClibc to produce an
"i686-ld" or "i686-readelf", you have to rename 'em after the fact.  And
a "cc -> gcc" symlink actually has four possible states, and "i686-cc -> gcc"
isn't the one you want.  Some darn _weird_ errors result if you just try to
run and debug this; visually inspecting the bin directory of the cross
compiler is much easier.  As opposed to debugging gcc, where visual
inspection tells you nothing and the useful thing to do is find a failing
command line and run it with -v and under strace to see what it's actually
_doing_.</p>

<p>So now Mark can set up the cron job and build nightly binaries, except
that I have to get uClibc's nightly snapshots working again.  (Every time
I ignore them for a month, when I come back they don't build anymore until
I've tweaked the config of a half-dozen platforms and come up with fresh
patches.  Might be different this time, but it seems unlikely.)</p>

<p>Oh I'd forgotten about that bug.  Occasionally software suspend on 8.04
will catch some weird race condition having to do with a dentry that's
active during the suspend, and will wind up turning every access to that
dentry into a segfault.  (Sometimes it does one of those non-fatal panics
and tells you it's a null pointer dereference in the vfs, sometimes it just
kills your process with segfault and no explanation.)  I remember the first
time I tried to explain source control to Fade, and show her mercurial,
Python spontaneously developed this affliction to screw up my demo.
Now kaffeine's got it, so I can't catch up on my podcasts until I
reboot.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Hundreds of open browser tabs, unlikely to get 'em closed
this week.  Rebooting with the network off means they'll all be 404 and I
won't be able to read cached data offline until I reload it.  Rebooting with
the net on will reload them all, meaning Konqueror will eat 100% of the CPU
because tabs that aren't selected still run their javascript (which is
a bad thing, but seems to be intentional).</p>

<p>And the dying thing is /usr/lib/libXdmcp.so.6 which is taking out
amarok too, so I can't listen to mp3s either.  Let's see, if I use Konqueror
to navigate to an mp3 file and click on it... It tries to launch amarok.
Idiot.  It has built-in mp3 playing capability, and the flash plugin can
also play mp3, but no, it wants to launch an external player.  Brilliant.</p>

<p>Oh well, at least the stupid "Are we human, or are we dancers" song I was
trying to drown out has gone off the radio now.  (Because no human can
dance you moronic whiny git.)  Now it's gone to some other song by the
same guy who did the original song Weird Al's "you're pitiful" is based on.
It's a whiny falsetto theme on this station.  The noise cancelling headphones,
they do nothing.</p>

<p>The radio has now moved on to "Every time you go away, you take a piece
of me with you".  The frightening part is that this is is an enormous step
_up_.  (At the very least, I'm no longer contemplating surreptitious ways to
damage the PA system here.  And no, it's not the theme from the "Saw"
movies.  Don't think it is, anyway, despite the title I never saw 'em.)</p>

<p>I should look at Xubuntu now that 9.04 is out.  Not looking forward

<p>Ooh, a <a href=http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/Flashback/chapter1.html>Let's
Play</a> that Yahtzee did back before <a href=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation>Zero Punctuation</a>.</p>

<p>Watched the first disk of "Avatar, the Last Airbender" today.
I previously thought it was an anime, but it's apparently a Nickelodeon
production in a vaguely Japanese style (up to and including Japanese
characters in the intro credits.  I have no idea why.  The practical
effect of this is I can't turn the horrible english voices off and go
to subtitles with Japanese voices that at least convey reasonable emotions
whether or not I can understand a word.  Nope, the english voice acting
_is_ the original.  I can only hope they improve as they get used to
the characters...</p>

<p>I spent the first episode hoping the brother would die.  The second episode
_almost_ involved whatserface and the avatar guy leaving the rest of the cast
behind (including the idiot brother) to go off on their own, but no.  End
of the disk, he's still there, which is sad.  (I liked the voice actor
when he was voicing Ron Stoppable, who was not a mysoginistic faux authority
figure constantly blaming other people for his own screw-ups.)  Still,
Babylon 5, Star Trek TNG, and Star Trek the Motionless Picture (where "Nomad"
has gone before) all started horribly and got better.  The water bender
girl and Aang's are both nice.  And the bad guy's mentor is great.</p>

<p>Also watched the rest of the first Torchwood disk (episode 2, Death By Sex),
the other commentary for Gosford Park (which is still way too complex for me
to follow even half of it, and based on cultural details of a society farther
from mine than the Yonomamo).  And now I'm watching Bleach disk 3 (still
episodes I've already seen back before Hulu stamped Watermarks all over
the screen) which remains inexplicably Japanese in places, stopping for
speeches about nature imagery in the middle of fight scenes.</p>

<a name="24-04-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#24-04-2009">April 24, 2009</a></h2>
<p>A year or so back, while unpacking the boxes we'd kept in storage back
in Pittsburgh, I found an old wristwatch that was still running.  The pastic
on one of the front buttons was missing, and when I held down the button to
light up the face, or when it tried to beep, the display went blank because
the battery just wasn't up to either activity.  But it kept good time, and it
wasn't nearly as uncomfortable to wear as the last couple of cheap chinese
watches I'd picked up at wal-mart (one of which gave me a more or less
sprained wrist after a week, and the other gave me a rash).  My last good
watch before that had gotten smashed against a table.</p>

<p>Last night, I noticed that my watch had fallen 15 minutes behind,
when it usually kept good time.  Today, there are no numbers on the face
at all, it's totally dead.  I feel I should have some kind of memorial service,
for a watch that came out of retirement to give me one more year.</p>

<p>It was a good watch.  I shall miss it.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Broke down and implemented a proper little setsid program in C, and made
system-image.sh build it and call it.  In theory I could have added this to
toybox, but the build doesn't _depend_ on toybox being there.  I could also
have upgraded the busybox version to do this, and still might, but
again the build shouldn't depend on the host setsid being buybox.  (You can
skip host-tools.sh.)  And the host setsid on Ubuntu is forking a background
process and returning immediately, which is useless for my purposes.</p>

<p>So yeah, spent a couple hours yesterday fighting with the shell in an
attempt to avoid writing 9 lines of C code.  (Because I shouldn't have
NEEDED to, darn it.)</p>
</span>

<p>*blink* *blink*  My watch appears to have had an Inigo Montoya moment.
It's back from the dead and keeping time again.  It was going all disco for a
bit there flashing and being generally nuts, but it settled down after about 5
minutes and now it's working just fine.  I have no idea what's up.  Perhaps it
got water in it?  Perhaps the battery is doing some strange chemical thing I'm
unaware of?  It's entirely possible it's gone undead on me, and/or is
posessed, but as long as it's functioning properly I have no immediate reason
to complain about this...</p>

<p>Weird.  Welcome back, wristwatch.  (Had to reset it.  It was off by about 2
hours, but other than that...)</p>

<p>So the work our big client asked us to do this week does not, in fact, have
a budget attached, and thus is not billable.  (I guess that means it's not work
product then?)  Nothing billable for us to do next week, either.  Meaning Mark
and I probably need to update our resumes so we can look for work that _is_
billable.  (I haven't objected to going down to half time due to a lack of
enough assigned work, and I'd personally happily take a few months off except
for the whole "buying my sister a house" thing, which makes this bad timing.
Oh well.  Closing should be at the end of the month, this doesn't affect
that.)</p>

<p>Alas, the original problem with running a business comes back to haunt
me: I have no trouble doing the technical work, but the sales work of finding
clients isn't something either Mark or I are good at.</p>

<a name="23-04-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#23-04-2009">April 23, 2009</a></h2>
<span id=programming>
<p>Ok, I haven't seriously poked at Firmware Linux in a week.  Time to
pick up the shovel again.</p>

<p>So where I left off is I rewrote buildall.sh to take advantage of the
canadian cross stuff, and everything broke.  The actual canadian cross
part broke, but more fundamentally the old buildall functionality broke.
One reason is that when system-image.sh dies, it tends to take down the
script that ran it because it does a "kill 0" which takes out the current
process group.  Hence the first system-image.sh to fail stops buildall.sh
from trying any of the later ones, and right how hw-uml is failing
because user mode linux is still horked, as usual.</p>

<p>The way build.sh works around this is by running it via
setsid (the "set session id" command explicitly creates a new process group),
but needing to do that is icky.  It would be nice if system-image.sh could do
that internally somehow, I just need to figure out how.</p>

<p>I can't put system-image.sh's logic in a shell function and call that via
setsid because setsid isn't a shell internal command, and a regular command
can't do anything useful with the name of a shell function on its command
line because it can't call _back_ into the shell that just forked and execed
it as a child process.  (I hit that one _all_the_time_.)  I could do something
incredibly ugly with "here" documents but the cure's worse than the disease
there, especially with what it does to syntax highlighting, which admittedly
has never worked in Ubuntu because Ubuntu hates vi for some reason and goes
out of its way to break it; another reason to switch to Gentoo or something
someday.</p>

<p>So my next attempt is to add this to the start of system-image.sh:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
if [ -z "$SYSTEM_IMAGE_SETSID" ]
then
  export SYSTEM_IMAGE_SETSID=1
  exec setsid "$0" "$@"
fi
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason that's unacceptable is now ctrl-c does nothing when
system-image.sh is running.  I took the exec out and added "exit $?" on
the next line, but that made no difference.</p>

<p>The _odd_ thing is that when I call the sucker from build.sh via setsid,
_that_ handles ctrl-c just fine.  So what's the difference here?  I tried
'setsid /bin/bash -i -- "$0" "$@"' and that confused the _heck_ out of
the tty.  (Ctrl-c gave me a shell prompt back, but didn't kill the running
script.)</p>

<p>Tried calling setsid through the built-in "time" function, since that
was the only difference I could see from what build.sh was doing vs this
thing calling itself.  No difference...</p>

<p>Ok, so I commented out the additions to system-image.sh and put the setsid
back into build.sh and now _that_ isn't letting ctrl-c work anymore either.
Which is strange because I'm pretty sure I tested that when it went in and it
was providing the correct behavior.  (I.E. kill system-image.sh and its
children, but not the calling shell.)</p>

<p>I want "kill this process and all child processes, recursively".  There
should be a way to do that.  (The gnu implementation of ps has --ppid, but the
busybox ps is kind of a joke.)</p>

<p>Grrr.  I need a way to call tcsetpgrp from the command line.  Why isn't
bash doing this when I call it from setsid?  Because its process already is
a session leader?  Except that 'echo | setsid xargs -- /bin/bash blah' isn't
interruptible either, and there bash is forced to be a child process of what
setsid calls.</p>

<p>I'm using 'kill 0' because neither 'kill %1' nor 'kill `jobs -p`' work from
signal context.  It can't access environment variables either, so I can't save
the PID and have it call that.  I suppose I can reset the signal handler with
an explicit list of PIDs to kill after every job I launch (make a function
for it)...  Except that _that_ doesn't work because killing the child
process isn't recursive, it doesn't kill the sub-processes like "make" it
was running (even though it wasn't a _background_ process for that shell,
so you'd think the shell would do it, but no it depends on the terminal control
group to propagate the signal).</p>

<p>Tried killing the pid of the background process as a negative number (which
I believe should kill its process group), but it claims it isn't a process
group.  Tried running the background process through setsid to force it to
_be_ a process group, but that didn't work either.  (Hang on, does busybox
know it's ok to do this?  Does the bash builtin kill know?  Trying $(which kill)
and... no help.  It's parsing the negative number as a signal number,
so try "kill -11 -$(jobs -p)" and... it says no such pid, but with the negative
number this time.  Huh, I thought they'd added that support to the kernel
years ago.  (Try without the setsid on the child process...  Nope.))</p>

<p>This _really_ should not be this hard.  I really, really, really don't
want to have to write C code for this.</p>

<p>Ok, spent another ten minutes installing an atexit handler in the outer
instance of the script, sending a signal 11 to the child session running
under setsid, catching that particular signal in there, and calling 'kill 0'
if it gets it.  Set up a little test where the child just waited 5 seconds,
like so:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
if [ -z "$SYSTEM_IMAGE_SETSID" ]
then
  echo Need to recurse
  export SYSTEM_IMAGE_SETSID=1
  setsid "$0" "$@" &
  trap "echo dying now, kill $(jobs -p); kill -11 $(jobs -p)" EXIT
  wait4background 0
  exit 0
else
  # If we exit before removing this handler, kill everything in the current
  # process group, which should take out backgrounded kernel make no matter
  # how many child processes it's spawned.
  trap "echo die lots now; kill 0 -QUIT; exit" 11

  echo do not recurse
  sleep 5
  echo done
  exit 0
fi
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The above _WAITS_FOR_THE_SLEEP_TO_END_ before delivering the signal 11.</p>

<p>*BOGGLE*  It sends the signal.  And the shell doesn't process the signal
until its child process exits.  WHAT THE...?</p>

<p>Sigh.  The reason this doesn't work:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
if [ -z "$SYSTEM_IMAGE_SETSID" ]
then
  echo recurse now
  export SYSTEM_IMAGE_SETSID=1
  setsid /bin/bash -- "$0" "$@" &
  trap "kill $(jobs -p) 2>/dev/null" EXIT
  fg
  exit $?
fi
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that it says "no job control" when it hits fg.  Presumably because the
shell isn't interactive.  I can replace the last two lines of the if block
with "wait4background 0" and "exit 0", but then I lose the error return
code of the background process.</p>

<p>EPIC FLAIL!</p>

<p>(Well, actually as development sessions go for me, this is pretty
tame.  Still frustrating, though.)</p>

<p>Sigh.  Domestic disputes, gotta love 'em.  (You can stop reading now,
nobody but me will care about this entry.)</p>

<p>My condo complex has designated parking spaces, and my neighbor's been
parking over the line of their space for a while now.  Annoying, but not a
big deal.  Today my neighbor came to yell at me because my car, parked
entirely inside the lines of my space, was preventing them from pulling
out.</p>

<p>I say "yell" because they did, and because they brought a friend with them,
and claimed I'd had them towed twice (which was news to me; I asked Mark and he
said he didn't tow anybody when he was here either).</p>

<p>I have towed cars that parked completely _in_ my space, but not for being
over the line and not since last September.  (It's an autumn ritual around
here, as each new year starts at UT and the renters figure out which spaces
are reserved and which aren't.)  If somebody tows you without authorization,
what you do is contact the towing company (only one services this garage,
number's on the sign over the door), then you get the paperwork related to
the tow which identifies who did it and has their signature.  Then you sue
them.</p>

<p>For once, the cell phone camera came in handy!  (Ok, I had to borrow
Fade's phone becuase my battery was low, and then I had to spend half
an hour fiddling with bluetooth to figure out how to get the pictures off.
But that's par for the course.)  Here's the
<a href=/pictures/Picture0004.jpg>space they leave on the
left</a>, and <a href=/pictures/Picture0005.jpg>the space
they leave on my side</a>.  (This is after I moved my car to the right
edge of my space, otherwise you couldn't see between 'em very well.
I tried a <a href=/pictures/Picture0007.jpg>close up</a>,
but the lighting makes it really hard to see.  If you're looking for the line
it's under the tires of the car on the left.)  This was actually fairly
mild "over the lines", he's been over by lots more, it's just this time
he decided to demand that I move my car to give him more space.  (Yeah,
I know...)</p>

<p>The hilarious part was that they say they've been complaining about me
to "Mrs. Thompson" for a while now, who I assume is the person they rent from.
(I own my condo, they rent.)  I took the pictures so I could send 'em to
the condo association if it comes up again.  (Which is McNeil property
management, still no "Mrs. Thompson").</p>
</span>

<p>Fairly unmemorable day, otherwise.  Baked a cake last night to use up the
rest of the whipped cream.  (Making whipped cream from actual cream
is a good thing.  Strawberries and cream turn out to be _much_ nicer than
plain strawberries, which is why we ran out of strawberries.)</p>

<p>The internet continues to be entertaining.  I hadn't previously seen
someone <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSjQajzyAF4>moonwalk

<p><a href=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-04-20/fortune-500s-biggest-losers/2/>Elsewhere</a>:</p>

<p>I suppose once somebody did a dance mix cover of "The Time Warp" it
was inevitable that <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_15nsGKBhc>a music
video made entirely out of clips from Dr. Who</a> would be set to it and
put on Youtube.  This is the internet after all.</p>

<p>That's not even a particularly remarkable one.  The
<a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4gTRP6LolE>weird science</a>
one makes better use of the Dr. Who material and matching it to
the music, as do <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbMRYx21ZX4&feature=related>this one</a>, and
<a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_YyRtJl--g>this one</a>.  There's often significant variation on the same songs, with

And some were <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bb_b6LqMrI>just
extended versions of what wound up in the show</a>, although you sometimes
realize how <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSdE9x5bvjU>carefully
cut</a> the original song was for broadcast TV.  (Yes, the part of the
song that wound up on TV was explicitly advocating murder, but didn't mention
_sex_.)  Bumped into some songs I'd <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_LlLMwHxJM>totally forgotten</a>, and I've even found some
<a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWhV_He_sqU>new music</a> doing this.</p>

<p>Of course Dr. Who isn't the only show with with music videos.
(Although <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM-Lnw-Rjl0>Harley/Ivy is

Penguicon really.  Yes, I've had more than one panel scheduled next door

<p>Saw "Monsters vs Aliens" today, which was entertaining but made me
appreciate Coraline more.  Coraline was _elegant_ in its use of 3D, when
the tunnel expanded into the distance it was _supposed_ to be otherworldly,
when the hands of the "piano that plays you" stepped out they _were_
intruding on coraline's space and being meanacing in a foreshadowing way.
The needle coming out at the start and poking the audience in the eyes was
supposed to be unsettling, as was the rest of that scene.  But it would
all work in 2D as well.</p>

<p>Today's movie wielded its 3D like a blunt instrument, and a lot of them
would just be silly in 2D.  Making a paddle ball fill the screen near the
start of the movie was just pointless showboating.  Monsters spent a lot
of time using 3D very intentionally.  Coraline simply _was_ 3D, and made
it look effortless and natural.</p>

<p>Some of it's technical stuff.  Several times Monsters had a bright 3D
object on a dark background, and a halo filtered through the polarized
lenses.  I never noticed that _once_ with Coraline.  (I'd also heard that
one of the failure modes of 3D is that rapidly shifting depth of focus for
an hour gives you eyestrain.  Never came up in Coraline, happened a lot in
Monsters.)  A movie should makes me _notice_ the technical tricks it's
doing, even when it's doing them reasonably well, because it defeats
the purpose.  Use the tricks to tell a story, not to show off the tricks.</p>

<p>I remember one of walt Disney's famous quotes was "Change the trick".  This
came up in an old a making of Who Framed Roger Rabbit documentary I watched,
where they showed around 10 seconds of footage of a human actor riding in
cartoon taxi (chase scene), and in one shot the human was on a crane with the
buggy painted over it, in the next he was on a miniature vehicle with the buggy
painted over it, and in the third both the buggy and the human were animated
(but they were going down a dark alley so it was harder to notice the human
wasn't the actor; and they still used his voice).  All in the space of ten
seconds.  The point was so that you _couldn't_ figure out what they were doing
because they kept doing different things.  (See a man in a rubber suit,
look again and it's now a puppet, look again and it's audioanimatronic...)</p>

<p>CGI eliminates a lot of this from a technical perspective, but not the
need for it from a storytelling perspective.</p>

<p>By the way, either Ginormica's grandfathers are The Doctor and Death, or
the name "Susan" attracts superpowers.  Somebody should ask The Invisible
Woman about this.</p>

Apparently there was a power failure at Mark's place long enough for the
UPS to drain, and when it came back it hung trying to get ipv6 information
from a dhcp server that wasn't giving it.  It hung for at least 12 hours
waiting for this, but continued immediately when I unplugged the darn router
(toggling the cat 5 connection status).  (Note: we're not using ipv6,

<p>So the problem with the canadian cross toolchains is that the pathing
is horked.  AGAIN.  Yet another thing for the wrapper to EXPLICITLY WHACK
WITH A HAMMER.  Except that I probably need to patch the source to _not_
let it look at the wrong areas _first_ before falling back to $PATH.
(And when it's _not_ canadian crossed, the path logic works DIFFERENTLY.
Or maybe it's some targets.)  Other than that, the sucker seems to work.
Or at least it builds a hello world that runs under qemu.</p>

<p>(Ok, technically it doesn't run under qemu-mips, but that's because the
current mips application emulation hangs attempting to run a hello world
statically linked against uClibc.  But that's not the toolchain's fault,
and it runs fine under qemu system emulation just fine.)</p>

<p>I'd hoped to drop off Mark at the airport _before_ rush hour started,

<p>I want to have Rachel Maddow's baby.  I'm aware that there are a number
of reasons this isn't likely: I'm male, I've never actually met her, I'm
married to somebody else, Rachel's gay and in a stable relationship with a
woman in the northeast somewhere...  Little things like that...</p>

<p>Went in to the mortgage guy's office down off of Bee Caves to sign
lots of paperwork for my sister's house.  Hopefully, that's the last of
it until closing.  (Between paying taxes, funding IRAs, and the down payment
and closing costs for my sister's house, I seem to have used up most of
my ready cash, _and_ acquired a new $615/month bill.  Oh well.)</p>

<p>Fade sounded distinctly forlorn when I called home around dinnertime,
so I felt compelled to go make her less forlorn.  (This involved sandwich,
fruit, three different types of caffeine, and a cookie.  She seems less
forlorn now.)</p>

<p>More fiddling with transcoding software, banging on qemu summaries,
and back to working on the canadian cross stuff too.</p> 

<p>Gotta take Mark to the airport at 4am, so he can go visit Eric and Cathy
for two weeks.</p>

<a name="13-04-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#13-04-2009">April 13, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Went to vist the investment guy this morning to actually do something
with the Roth IRAs Fade and I set up last week.  The S&amp;P 500 fund Wells
Fargo has eats 5.75% of your investment up front, right off the top, as
a management feet.  (Ouch.)  I wanted to buy a share of Berkshire Hathaway
Class B stock (currently around $3k) and put the rest in the S&amp;P 500
fund, but I wound up putting it all in the fund because to do that they'd
have to transfer the money into a self-managed account which would take
at least a day meaning I'd have to come back _again_.  (Yeah, I know this
is how they make their money.)</p>

<p>Fade went with the managed fund the guy recommended.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Being diplomatic seems to primarily be a question of what you _don't_
do.  For example, I let two different people have the last word over on the
crossgcc mailing list.  (The guy who took the position that the only truly
"embedded" systems are the ones with 64k of ram or less, which by extension
there's no such thing as embedded Linux.  He stopped emailing me when I stopped
replying to him, unlike the guy who claimed my response to him was flame bait,
and then continued to reply to it for a couple more pages of text, and
post follow-up emails.  Has yet to notice he's arguing with himself.  About
automobiles.  Yes, really.)</p>

<p>This comes to mind because I'm trying to be diplomatic about the qemu
mailing list summaries, and there's a guy named Ian Jackson who is
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2008-02/msg00254.html>so</a>
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2008-02/msg00476.html>consistently</a>
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2008-02/msg00381.html>wrong</a>
that I feel compelled to point it out in my summaries as one of the things
you'd notice if you read every message.  I mean he's
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2008-02/msg00269.html>good
natured</a> about it.  He seems to mean well.  A lot of "don't ask questions,
post errors" progress happens because of him.  (And it's entirely possible I'm
being influenced by the fact he's the main guy trying to push Xen code upstream
into the qemu repository, which is the first thing that made me question his
judgement.)  He certainly knows more about the guts of qemu than _I_
do...</p>

<p>But I started my summary in the middle of
<a href="/qemu/2008-02-19.html#February_20,_2008_-_[PATCH]_bdrv_flush_error_handling.">this thread</a>
because I couldn't think of any way to gloss over the start of it that didn't
sound like "The thread started with Ian being wrong again, and while various
people were correcting him..."</p>

<p>Sigh.  I reserve the right to be honestly wrong myself.  I _need_ it in
domains like the linux kernel mailing list, where I know I'm outclassed in
terms of domain expertise.  I really don't want to be hard on this guy,
but I also don't want to quote anything he says without some kind of
disclaimer, which has caused me more than one bout of writer's block
summarizing.</p>

<p>Also researching video conversion software, primarily
<a href=http://www.ffmpeg.org/>ffmpeg</a>.  My first largeish conversion
with it resulted in badly out of sync audio (bad enough to be distracting
after a couple minutes, accumulating to something like 7 seconds difference
at the end of an hour long video).  Wondering if that was a version-specific
bug, or if I invoked it wrong?  Dunno.</p>

<p>Ok, my working style's gotten some pretty deep groves in it.  I just
got to a good stopping point with the <a href=/qemu/rebuild.sh>rebuild.sh</a>
and <a href=/qemu/indexsections.py>indexsections.py</a> files for
<a href=/qemu>Qemu Weekly News</a> (hey, I'm up to the end of January, 2008!
Woot!).  And I went, "ok, time to check these into source control"... and I
haven't got source control for 'em.  (Well they don't develop, except for
those two pieces of infrstructure, one of which is from the
old <a href=http://kernel.org/docs/make>kernel docs</a> I spent half of 2007
poking at, each <a href=/qemu/2008-01-01.idx>data file</a> gets finished and
should never change again after that.)</p>

<p>Seems silly to set up a mercurial instance for two files, and/or to check
in lots of static files.</p>

<p>Fade's been busy with online appointments for 6 hours so far today.
(This is fairly normal.)</p>

<p>My attempt to come up with a paper for the Linux Plumber's Conference hit
the snag that the scope of everything I tried to write was just too big.
Even my _outlines_ spanned multiple pages, and just kept getting bigger.
(I suppose I could try again tomorrow, but mostly I want to sit down and
spend a couple _weeks_ writing documentation, not a couple hours.  So 
many tangents...)</p>

<p>Spent rather a lot of the day doing qemu mailing list summaries instead.
Lots of funky editorial decisions there, but they're mostly "should this
thread be included or not, and how much".  The scope of each week is
"threads starting between this date and this date", and from there it's
a question of _removing_ stuff, not adding it...</p>

<p>For example, currently I'm trying to figure out if <a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2008-02/msg00182.html>this thread</a> is
worth covering.  Four posts between two people, riffing off a LWN thread
that already implemented something, wondering if qemu could do a better job
and deciding "no".  Long term result for qemu: none really.  Is it likely
to come up again?  Dunno, probably not.  Is it good background material
explaining how qemu wound up the way it did?  Well, sort of, but not very.</p>

<p>Or how about
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2008-02/msg00193.html>these</a>
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2008-02/msg00283.html>two</a>, where somebody asks a very good question... and never gets an answer.</p>

<p>Yeah, all this is totally subjective, but most editorial jobs are.</p>

<p>Darn it.  Making a canadian cross work in root-filesystem.sh is harder than
it looks.  (Right now the same compiler builds libgcc.a and crtbegin.o as
builds the gcc executable.  I need to specify _different_ compilers for that.
Ideally, those should be a separate build target, except re-running ./configure
between build targets would be hilariously ugly.  Once again, the autoconf
step makes simple things hard...)</p>

<p>Saw The Last Unicorn with author Peter S. Beagle at the Drafthouse, with
Mark.  (Who has shaved his head.  Mark has, I mean.)</p>

<p>The drafthouse was deeply disorganized about this (he's introducing the
movie!  No, he's doing a Q&amp;A afterwards!  No, he's just signing stuff in the
lobby!  Wait, no, the Q&amp;A is starting, after 1/3 of the audience left
because they were explicitly told it wasn't.  Right.  (In their defense, this
was an encore presentation.  The wednesday showing sold out, and the author
was still in town, so...  Still, the drafthouse guy who announced to the
audience that we should all go out to the lobby because the Q&amp;A had been
yesterday?  Bad form.)</p>

<p>It was a good Q&amp;A.  Lots of fun writing things which he said he'd
answer differently in an academic environment (where he didn't have beer;
he introduced himself as a "beer snob", hence his enjoyment of Austin and
The Drafthouse which serves more different types of beer than many pubs).
Very honest, lots of "that symbolism was entirely subconscious, it just felt
right.  I was writing it to see how it turned out, sometimes you get away
with that and sometimes you don't."  Somebody pointed out how much he'd packed
into two sentences they quoted and how other authors would take a half-dozen
pargraphs to say as much, and he immediately pointed out "I wrote those six
paragraphs first".  Marvelous bit about how hard writing the screenplay for the
Rankin/Bass adaptation of Lord of the Rings was ("I told him I've been writing
for days and I haven't reached the Riders of Rohan yet, and Arthur groaned
and collapsed on the desk... He'd forgotten about the Riders of Rohan"), and
how some things just don't translate well to animation.  He thought a live
action version of The Last Unicorn with modern CGI could follow the book more
closely.  And that it hadn't occurred to him when he was writing it that
Prince Lyr would grow up to be King Lyr, just that the name sounded right.
And that making the cat a pirate wasn't actually his idea (although he loved
it), he just put a cat in the book because there was a cat curled up on his
desk when he was writing the book; more or less the same cat.</p>

<p>His business manager (I've forgotten his name) was also there, and answered
my question about "Do all unicorns turn into anime chicks?" by pointing out
that the next project the Japanese animation team Rankin/Bass hired to do The
Last Unicorn went on to do immediately afterwards was "Nausica, valley of the
Wind" and they formed the core of Studio Ghibli.  (So yeah, there's a *reason*
the unicorn transforms into a girl with big eyes and a small mouth, naked
transformation sequences that never quite show any actual anatomy, and so on.)
The Japanese guys apparently submitted redesigns for most of the characters,
and the rankin/bass guys agreed to some changes and kept the original for
others.  Apparently the witch Angela Lansbury voiced was one of the Japanese
designs.  (As far as I can tell, Almathea pretty much looks like her voice
actrees with more hair, but the style's a bit of a giveaway.)</p>

<p>I hadn't realized how much of an all-star cast it was.  Rene Auberjonois
voiced the skeleton before he was even on _Benson_, let alone played Odo on
Deep Space 9.  Mia Farrow went on to play Supergirl two years later (she
still can't sing, though).  Prince Lyr was voiced by Jeff Bridges (Flynn from
Tron, most recently the bad guy in Iron Man... he could _almost_ sing).
Christopher Lee voiced King Hagard (more recently he was Count Dooku and
Saruman).</p>

<p>Bought two books and had Mr. Beagle sign both.</p>

<p>Ah, I'd forgotten how kmail treats mbox files with more than 32767 messages
in them.  (At least in Kubuntu 8.04 LTS.)  Decide the sucker is corrupted,
pop up a window announcing it's going to rebuild the indexes (losing the
read/unread/flagged status of all existing messages) with only one button
that doesn't let you tell it _not_ to do this thing, and then loop endlessly
popping up the window again with no way to cancel it because the thing still
has more than 32767 messages in it.  Bravo, kmail.  Bravo.</p>

<p>The way out is to kill it (except you have to kill kontact, not kmail,
because they sucked it into a Microsoft Office style bundle), copy the mbox
file to a backup, open the original with vi, delete the first 100,000 lines
or so and trim it to the start of a message, save and exit, delete all the
hidden files starting with the same name as the mbox file (the indexes),
restart kmail, and let it regenerate them then.</p>

<p>Simplicity, elegance, scalability...  Yeah.</p>

<p>Poking at Sparc, which I last seriously fiddled with
<a href=notes-2008.html#13-11-2008>back in november</a>.  Last night I
re-fixed the <a href=http://impactlinux.com/hg/firmware/rev/708>sparc ELF
type glitch</a>, but as to why the dynamic linker isn't working, I dunno.
The kernel seems to have built fine with that toolchain...</p>

<p>Implemented BUILD_NICE and BUILD_VERBOSE in FWL.  The first makes build.sh
automatically nice down the rest of the builds, the second feeds V=1 to the
Linux, uClibc, and BusyBox builds.  (Yeah, you can do the first from the command
line and the second's a trivial patch to the scripts when you're debugging
something.  But it's nice to be able to make the first persistent in .config,
and the second transient from the command line.  A convenience, nothing
more.)</p>
</span>

<p>Ooh, I accidentally hit "i" in Kaffeine (I thought I the vi window had
focus), and it turned "deinterlace" on, which is actually something I'd
been trying to figure out how to do.  (Otherwise the bleach dvd it's showing
looks terrible whenever things move around on screen to fast.)</p>

<p>But why would deinterlace ever _not_ be on?  (Isn't interlacing an artifact
of CRT scanning which even modern LCD and plasma televisions need to compensate
for?</p>

<p>Weird Al's <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz-grdpKVqg>Don't

<p>Distinctly under the weather today.  Fade said she felt blah a couple days
ago, now I've got it.  (Very mild upset stomach, zero energy.)  Not really
feeling like doing anything specific, so I cleaned the kitchen.  (Always
a good option when nothing particularly seems worth doing at the moment.)</p>

<p>The cable modem's out.  (There's that marvelous service Time Warner wants to
charge extra for.)  Somewhat inconvenient to look up time warner's number
without internet access.  I'm spoiled.  Have to go dig up the phone book...
And it's a "signal issue".  A guy has to come look at it, some time tomorrow
between 8 am and 9 pm.</p>

<p>Checked the other local wireless access points.  I could associate with
a couple but they route packets either.  Dunno what that means.  Heading down
to Thundercloud, I haven't had breakfast yet anyway.</p>

<p>Removed mlocate and updated my "next time I reinstall" list.  (Having a cron
job start up and hog the disk when I resume my laptop is silly, especially for
a service I never use.)  I should probably poke at Xubuntu 9.04 when it comes
out.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Long design discussion going on with Yann Morin, maintainer of
crosstool-ng (and the guy who wrote <strike>insmod</strike> modprobe for
busybox long ago, which is where I know him from).  I belatedly remembered
to cc: it to the FWL mailing list.</p>

<p>The fact that off the top of my head I can find a dozen objects to the
design of crosstool-ng isn't really a big deail, because finding objections
to software designs is just about a superpower with me.  I object to my
own designs; toybox is stalled because the design needs work (possibly
a complete rewrite in lua), and Firmware Linux fundamentally should just
be four packages: kernel, C library, compiler, command line tools.  I was
trying for linux, uClibc, tinycc, and toybox for a while there, but the
tinycc development community and I had an unhealthy relationship and I
broke it off.  The linux kernel needs a "hello world" variant we can
build up from with the boot wrapper code, early_printk, and _nothing_else_.
But I haven't got time to investigate and restructure it.</p>

<p>A few other things currently wrong with FWL, off the top of my head and
by no means even CLOSE to exhaustive:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The distcc accelerator needs a far more obvious way to tell it's
working.  The cc1 instances are too short lived to show up much on "top",
and it's transparent enough you're not quite sure it's _there_.</p></li>
<li><p>The uClibc build doesn't distribute via distcc, something to do with
the build flags.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole of build-static-toolchains.sh is horrible.  I know I've redone
it 5 times, but it's still horrible.  The hdc stuff might help, now
that squashfs 4.0 is out.<p></li>
<li><p>Distributing via distcc is TOO DARN SLOW.  It doesn't parallelize
enough.  I need to switch to the virtual gigabit adapter, use tcc -E for
the preprocessing, get the multiple qemu instance clustering thing
implemented...  And possibly rewrite distcc from scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>Several targets don't work.  Sparc's been hosed for years, I've never
been able to test m68k, still can't test arm big endian, armeb is incomplete
and has no test environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The uClibc++ build is darn fiddly, and retrofitting it into the
cross compiler is horrible.  It breaks easily, not reliable...  Ugh.</p></li>
<li><p>I never even _tried_ to use gcc's sysroot thing.  After _five_ previous
attemps by gcc to fix its path logic by adding another layer on top of
the existing crap, I never even considered the idea that the correct approach
to fixing gcc's path logic is to take the decision out of gcc's hands
entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, I don't have an equivalent to the multilib stuff yet.
I can make ccwrap.c take the same command line arguments and dispatch, but
in theory using gcc's built-in mutilib stuff could save some space rather
than building shared infrastructure again for every target variant.  But
that would involve trusting gcc to be able to find its own ass with both
hands, which I just don't.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole "seven packages to rebuild" is a bit of a lie when I'm
using toybox unconditionally.  Admittedly I could police my patches so
they never need to apply at an offset, and thus use busybox patch, but
that's a huge pain.  I should push my patch implementation upstream into
busybox.  And fix their netcat -l, and even if they don't want oneit I
can do it as a busybox patch locally.  At this point, I'm unlikely to
push toybox to a complete busybox replacement for the same reason I haven't
gotten qemu weekly news up to date.  Not quite "not enough hours in the day",
but "not enough energy when I do have time".  But I should either finish
this or replace it.</p></li>
<li><p>Too many config options.  I don't want to use menuconfig, but
at least GFS should be able to set these suckers.</p></li>
<li><p>What _is_ the relationship between GFS and FWL?  They're not quite
separate projects and not quite the same project.  It's ugly, needs to be
clarified.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm stuck with the GPLv2 versions of stuff because I don't do GPLv3,
and the FSF has abandoned GPLv2.  Those package versions are going to go
obsolete, badly.  (Ok, gnu tar went 5 years without a release, so it's not on
_that_ short of a timeline, but it's been 2 already, even if I upgrade to
4.2.1.)  I need to find replacements for all the
Free Software Foundation's code, but with tinycc development stuck and pcc and
llvm still not able to build a linux kernel (and showing no interest in that
as a goal)...  I don't have the time or expertise to take tinycc back up and
glue qemu tcg onto it myself, but if I don't what's my alternative?
My recent exchange with grischka turned me off to banging on mainline tcc
again because I don't respect his technical judgement as a maintainer, and
thus don't feel like trying to argue him around to my point of view on
anything significant.  The amount of work he's putting into it is less
than I'm _currently_ putting into toybox.  But doing my own tinycc fork
is just so MASSIVELY unrewarding as long as that other fork exists and
takes the credit for anything I do, whether or not they even bother to
merge it.</p></li>
<li><p>host-tools.sh is too complicated and has too much stuff in it.
(Again the "seven packages" thing is more an ideal than a reality; e2fsprogs,
squashfs...  and building or symlinking qemu is just _UGLY_.)</p></li>
<li><p>run-from-build.sh is a great big layering violation.  It includes
sources/include.sh which means qemu needs to be in host-tools.sh which is
just awful.</p></li>
<li><p>mini-native.sh is a horrible name, I should rename it to native-rootfs.sh or something, thus confusing everybody familiar with the current name.</p></li>
<li><p>The scripts are full of bash dependencies everywhere, without a decent
bash replacement.  I should at the very least teach busybox ash to understand
{curly,bracket} syntax and >(executable redirects) and then teach build.sh to
use ash out of build/host.  Then try to build everything with ash instead of
bash.  The roadblock here is somewhere between my vanity (I _can_ write a
new shell from scratch, that would be much better than this, but as with
qemu weekly news will I live to see it completed?) and laziness (interacting
with other developers is harder than just doing it myself; a variant of
the old "reading code is harder than writing it" failing, and the fact that
if I start messing with ash I'll find SO MUCH STUFF that needs fixing that
I'll go off into the weeds for months ripping ash a new one.  I just know
it).</p></li>
<li><p>My FWL documentatioon sucks, I need to rewrite it again.  A lot.
The README is too long and doesn't say enough, documentation.html is
just incoherent and incomplete AND too long AND not thorough enough...</p></li>
<li><p>AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Did I mention that years ago I learned not to be bothered by the fact
that everything I write sucks?</p>

<p>No really.  I _expect_ it to suck, from my point of view, because I know
what's wrong with it and how it could be better.  It could always
be better.  All you can do is find the point of _least_ suck, which is a
local peak at best.  But you have to just botch something together, make do
with it as best you can, and move on to the next crisis.  Fake it with style.
If you're lucky, you can come back and make it suck incrementally less later,
but as with optimizing there will ALWAYS be a bottleneck.  All you really do
is move it around, in an eternal game of whackamole.</p>

<p>This is the "better to wield a flamethrower than to curse the darkness"
approach to creative endeavor.  When wielding a chainsaw against infinite
quantities of suck, you have to get your satisfaction out of the wielding
part, not any resulting lack of suck.  A cat does not play with a string
because they expect to finish off the string.  (Ok, that's one depends on the
cat.)</p>

<p>Hey, I forgot the kde system monitor thingy, which graphically shows me how

any noticeable amount of CPU even though I've got a build-static-toolchains.sh
running.  Now what's gotten screwed up...</p>

<p>Brittle.  Evil.  Do not seamlessly fall back to local compiling, FAIL
NOISILY SO I CAN SEE IT'S NOT WORKING.  Grr.  When the distcc trick is
enabled, the _only_ things gcc should be doing locally are preprocessing
and linking, no compiling.</p>

<p>I should just break down and teach ccwrap to do this.  At least I know
exactly how that sucker works...</p>

<p>Ah.  Doh!  My fault, it's building mini-native, so it's using the cross
compiler it just built, which means the the distcc config on the host compiler
isn't being used.</p>

<p><a href=http://icanhascheezburger.com/2009/03/19/funny-pictures-your-involvement-ended/>This is what our new couch looks like</a>, except for the
actual couch part, and there are more cats, and the word balloon is merely
implied.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>The gcc source code is one of the most horrible codebases I've ever
encountered.  The layers of unnecessary indirection are painful to _describe_,
let alone wade through.</p>

<p>I'm trying to make arm big endian work.  I've been trying for two days.
I figured out what needs to change hours ago (the line #define SUBTARGET_EXTRA_LINK_SPEC " -m armelf_linux -p" in gcc/config/arm/linux-elf.h needs to change
armelf_linux into armelfb_linux for big endian versions), but figuring out
how to come up with a patch that works for both big and little endian is
a FLAMING PAIN.</p>

<p>I refuse to conditionally apply patches.  The same code should work for
all targets, anything else is stupid.  But gcc is just so horrible.  This
is creating a built-in spec file, which gets parsed at runtime.  The
information available at compile time and the information avilable at runtime
aren't on _speaking_ terms with each other.</p>

<p>First, they implement their own totally unnecessary language (spec files),
and resolve things at runtime using that language.  There's no need for
it to _exist_ except that they couldn't make anything simpler work and
their reaction to failure is to add more complexity and layers.</p>

<p>So I'm tring to determine the default endianness at compile time.  The
default endianness is determined at _runtime_ by the global target_flags,
which is initialized from the global structure targetm.default_target_flags
in gcc/opts.c.  The targetm structure turns out to be "struct gcc_target"
which is defined in gcc/target.h.  That's a big ginormous struct definition,
going on for pages and pages.  The global instance targetm is initialized
by target specific code, in this case residing in gcc/config/arm/arm.c, but
every target's initialization boils down to the same line:
struct gcc_target targetm = TARGET_INITIALIZER; and TARGET_INITIALIZER is a
giant macro defined in gcc/target_def.h.</p>

<p>The _ugly_ part is that TARGET_INITIALIZER is this mess:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/* The whole shebang.  */
#define TARGET_INITIALIZER                      \
{                                               \
  TARGET_ASM_OUT,                               \
  TARGET_SCHED,                                 \
  TARGET_VECTORIZE,                             \
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Going on for, I kid you not, _80_lines_.  So at first glance, the only way
to figure out which of the 8 gazillion sub-macros results in a given field is
to count the members of struct gcc_target in gcc/target.h and then count in to
the corresponding line in TARGET_INITIALIZER.  Then go track down what that
macro does.  All the while hoping that none of the initialization macros
results in more than one structure (and there are a LOT of sub-structures in
targetm).</p>

<p>Except that the first three of those macros each initialize large
structures, and the fourth turns out to be the one I'm looking for.
(Go figure, it's not part of a structure but at the top level.)  So
TARGET_SECTION_TYPE_FLAGS is #defined earlier in the file to
default_section_type_flags... which is a function?  It's in gcc/varasm.c
as a single line wrapper around another function,
default_section_type_flags_1 (I don't know why), and that sets it to
either SECTION_CODE or SECTION_WRITE...  Darn it, looks like I went down
a strange blind alley again?  Those are defined in gcc/output.h and
don't mention endianness...  That's for elf sections, I want the elf
header.</p>

<p>Ok, I got on this trail because I added a #warning RUTABEGA right before
the #define I need to add an #ifdef around, and when I cut and paste the first
compiler invocation make spat out that produced that warning, removed its
-o stanza and added -dM -E instead, one of the lines it spit out was:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#define TARGET_BIG_END ((target_flags & MASK_BIG_END) != 0)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Which looked promising.  MASK_BIG_END is (1<<5) so that's not very useful,
and I just traced target_flags to a dead end.  Wheee.  Either I missed
a curve while tracing it through, or there's more than one target_flags
(even though it's a global).</p>

<p>I hate the free software foundation.  All of their code is like this.  They
never clean up and remove anything, they just make it bigger and more
unnecessarily convoluted, with each release.  I have wasted DAYS tracing
through this crap.  As usual, I already know the change I need to make and
have no _clue_ how to get their code to do it sanely (or at least
consistently).</p>

<p>This would be easier if it wasn't the compile time "string1" "string2"
combining thing.  You can't put runtime logic around any of that, because
adjacent strings only concatenate automatically at commpile time; after
that you have to allocate memory and do strcat().</p>

<p>Oh it _can't_ be that easy, can it?</p>

<p>Sigh.  Should have known.  This is FSF code.  The correct response isn't
to add stuff to it, the correct response is to rip stuff out:</p>

<p>The linker knows what machine types it supports, and has a default which

<p>(Did I mention that binutils was only nominally maintained by the FSF
for many years, and _actually_ maintained by Cygnus, which was bought by Red
Hat?  They had their <a href=http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/binutils/>own
fork</a> and everything.  This is probably why binutils is generally less
stupid than code more actively intefered with by FSF zealots who couldn't code
their way out of a paper bag yet are very firm about religious idology.  Alas,
the fork went to GPLv3 when the base did, and is thus useless.)</p> 

<p>So yeah, arm big endian builds now.  I should try to come up with a test
environment for it...</p>

<p>So, a little _practical_ advice about <a href=http://stoptwc.info/>the time
warner thing</a>.  According
to <a href=http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/04/02/0402timewarner.html>The Statesbeing</a>,
Austin does have another cable modem service provider,
<a href=http://www.grandecom.com>Grande Communications</a>, which has
explicitly stated they have no plans to cap bandwidth.  The obvious thing to
do is switch away from the idiots and start buying service from non-stupid
people.</p>

<p>So it looks like the question becomes "how can we get out of our TWC
contracts", and _that_ is a question best handled by small claims court or a
class action suit if they're going to be stroppy.</p>

<p>The sad part is if they were _actually_ threatening to cap our bandwidth,
I.E. slow down the connection once we'd passed a certain activity threshold,
I don't think anybody would really mind.  People are describing this as a cap,
when it's actually "extra random charges for using the service you sold us for
a flat fee".  So if they let us download the first gigabyte each day
at 3 megabits/second, then packet shaped us down to 128k/second after that
(or perhaps some more gradual, less noticeable tail-off)...  Well it would be
_annoying_ but not reason for widescale organized protests.  But no, they want
the opportunity to present us with unexpected bills for $200 or more.  They
don't want to provide less service for what we pay them, they want to charge
us more money for what they're giving us now.  Potentially, 10 times as much.
This is because they are GREEDY BASTARDS.</p>

<p>"You ate too much from the buffet, pay us three times what the sign says"
is not going to win you a lot of repeat customers.</p>

<p>Phone TWC, turns out our contract's expired so we can switch at any time.
Bad news: Grande doesn't service this location yet.  (But they offer service
two blocks north, and have another six months to install new lines, so
here's hoping.)</p>

<p>Good to see <a href=http://stoptwc.info/>grassroots mobilization against
Time Warner's stupidity</a>.  It's also becoming a <a href=http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/03/30/daily47.html>political issue</a>.  Lots

<p>I repeat: Time Warner needs to pull back a bloody stump from this attempt.
They won't learn if it doesn't hurt.  Regulate the hell out of 'em, _and_
I'm looking around for other ISPs.</p>

<p>I already emailed the address in that last link to ask what their procedure
is for getting out of our contract early.  If they don't have one, or if they
try to charge extra for it, that's grounds for a class action lawsuit right
there...</p>

<p>Fade bought an Xbox 360 today.  I see it as a Netflix viewer with HD
capability for when we upgrade the TV.  She actually plans to play games on
it (although the guy at the store warned us that the Law Offices of Small

between the laser and the surface of the platter, so if a cat walks by while
it's got a disk in use it'll destroy the disk.  Brilliant.  I repeat: netflix
viewer).</p>

<p>Considering that watching five movies a month in HD via netflix
puts us over the bandwidth cap if we do _nothing_ else with the connection,
leaving time warner becomes pretty much essential from a purely pragmatic
standpoint.</p>

<p>We have a couch.  It is orange.  I should take a picture of it.</p>

<p>Mark and I rented a u-haul, got the couch installed (a small phrase which
contains a lot of incident), and then moved the rest of his stuff out of
the old apartment into his new garage.  (Most notably the washer and dryer.)</p>

<p>Now at Mark's pulling what's turning into another all-nighter, switching
between working on the crosstool-ng patches Cisco wanted and getting FWL 0.9.6
ready for release. (I was hoping to have a FWL release out _before_ the end of
the month, but as midnight approaches it's not looking likely.)</p>

<p>No I didn't pull two all-nighters in a row, I did an all-nigher sunday
night, and now I'm pulling an all-nigher tuesday night.  (Monday night was at
home, Fade and I watched the rest of the Schoolhouse Rock DVD and )</p>

<p>It's a bit odd to be copying things I got working in FWL months ago into
into a completely different open source toolchain project (which is also mostly
a single person endeavor).  The fact it took me about an hour to get FWL to
produce such a toolchain and over a week to get crosstool-ng to do it doesn't
enter into it, apparently.  They want what they want, and are willing to pay
to get what they want.  I don't understand _why_ they want it, but

<p>Busy week.  Mark and I got together yesterday and banged on FWL and GFS,
and we're in pretty good shape for a release.  Made a read only root filesystem
work.  Squashfs isn't working (needs updated userspace tools that aren't out
yet), but in theory one tweak to download.sh and that's in.</p>

<p>Just wrote up the past 4 weeks of reports for FWL.  Posting them to the list
to give Mark something to put in the bloggy thing on impactlinux.com.</p>

<p>Lots and lots of little FWL tweaks preparing for a release.  The static

<p>The 2.6.29 kernel's network flakes out under load.  Nothing in dmesg, no
obvious error.  It just... stops, suddenly.  Luckily,
<a href=http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/14465/>there's a fix</a>.  Here's
hoping 2.6.29.1 ships by monday...</p>

<p>Ok, there are times when I wonder what other programmers are smoking.</p>

<p>An "archiver" is a type of program that combines a bunch of individual files
into a single file.  Tar and zip are examples of archivers.  This is not a
new concept.</p>

<p>The "genext2fs" and "mksquashfs" programs are essentially archivers,
because they do what archivers do.  But they're not _implemented_ as archivers,
and thus their command line argument parsing is missing obvious
functionality.</p>

<p>For example, with tar I can list a bunch of files and directories
to put in the archive.  If I want to rebase my root directory, there's
the tar "C" option or I can "(cd dirname; tar blah blah blah) > filename.tar".
(It's even smart enough to spit the progress indicator to stderr so it
doesn't wind up redirected into the tarball.)  This functionality is many
years old, and quite standardized.</p>

<p>But genext2fs takes exactly one input source: a directory.  That's it.
You can't feed it a list of files, you can't specify more than one directory,
and it does the "cd into that directory so the directory itself doesn't show
up in the output" thing without giving you the option for it _not_ to do
that.</p>

<p>The mksquashfs program is less stupid.  You can specify multiple input
files and directories, but everything you specify on the command line gets
squashed to the top level directory.  I.E. if you specify "build/sources"
it tries to put it as "sources" at the top level.  That's not how archivers
work.</p>

<p>Of course this isn't nearly as weird as when I'm trying to figure out
what _I_ was thinking when I wrote code.  Toybox patch broke again, so I
have to untangle it and fix it.  (Patch shouldn't be this fiddly.)  I was
most of the way through rewriting it to handle a patch it turned out I didn't
need to apply.  I shouldn't discard that work (because it addressed a real
problem, just one that turned out not to be pressing), but I hadn't finished
debugging it yet...  Do I even still have the old test case?  Wheee...</p>

<p>Much frowning at what TT.state means in various contexts.  Managed to
the state in patch_main() a local variable, which helped a lot.  That
leaves TT.state mostly being used by do_line()...</p>

<p>I have to cut a new toybox patch with the bugfixes to the "patch" command,
and fix the resize2fs stuff so it doesn't screw up GFS.  But tomorrow,
I think...</p>

<p>Fade and I went to Lax today and bought a couch.  It's orange, because

It's sad new Ubuntu releases break more stuff than they fix, because it _does_

<span id=programming>
<p>More testing, fixed a number of small bugs.  Squashfs does not work,
because the most recent release version of mksquashfs produces a squashfs 3.1
file and the kernel only supports squashfs 4.0.  Sigh.  (Also, it needs
the misc filesystem config symbol to be enabled, I need to fix kconfig so
that when KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG switches on a symbol, the menu containing that
symbol also gets switched on.  No point HAVING the symbol in ALLCONFIG,
eh?</p></p>

<p>Finished the README and checked it in.  Now banging on the static
cross compiler auto-build script (which is 99% of the cron job).
Lots of little corner cases...</p>

<p>Still poking at the FWL manifest file.  When I first wrote do_readme()
it was called from a file that didn't source include.sh (just functions.sh),
so the PATH=build/host bit didn't come up.  Calling it with the trimmed $PATH
does not combine well with UNSTABLE support or fetching the mercurial
revision of the build scripts.</p>

<p>Oh, hang on, this needs to go in download.sh, because that's where package
versions are defined.  It needs to go at the end, which means it won't get
zapped by download.sh because download.sh's job will be to regenerate it.</p>
</span>

<p>Worried about Mark.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Heard back about the ppc 440 board, some kind of glitch was found in the
prototypes and they're fixing it before sending us one.</p>

<p>Ok, todo list for the release:</p>

<ul>
<li>add config option for the newly repaired cross compiler smoke test (which
doesn't work on arm without root access because a change to the linux
kernel broke qemu)</li>
<li><strike>get sparc building again</strike></li>
<li><strike>get the manifest file added for GFS</strike></li>
<li><strike>finish the README file and check it in</strike></li>
<li><strike>build static cross compilers</strike></li>
<li>get the cron job working</li>
<li>test everything</li>
<li><strike>Fix the resize2fs thing, it breaks GFS</strike></li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, the new config entry you have to enable to get qemu application
emulation to test run a hello world binary at the end of cross-compiler.sh
is CROSS_SMOKE_TEST.</p>

<p>Ok, the sparc thing is because the linux 0.9.29 kernel unified the
sparc 32 bit and 64 bit architectures.  This broke uClibc the same way
the x86/x86_64 unification did, because kernel_types.h in uClibc is too
brittle for words (and I still don't understand why it reproduces
chunks of asm/posix_types.h instead of just #including it).</p>

<p>Writing a MANIFEST file to the top level of mini-native turns out to be
darn fiddly.  I've already got a do_readme() in sources/functions.sh but the
problem is that that to figure out what version of the actual FWL scripts we're
building from, you need the "hg" command.  Two problems with this: 1) hg might
not be installed on the host, and there's no guarantee you're building in a
mercurial repository instead of a downloaded tarball anyway, 2) even if it is
there, host-tools.sh edits hg out of the $PATH.</p>

<p>Note that I can generate must of the _rest_ of the package versions even with
a trimmed $PATH, because it's based on the packages/* filenames.  (Except
for the alt versions, which need either mercurial or subversion.)  But knowing
which FWL scripts built this system image seems kind of important.</p>

<p>I actually _can't_ solve the general case, because there are times when the
info isn't available, so leaving this field blank sometimes is inevitable.  For
example, when you download a tarball snapshot from the mercurial web viewer, it
includes a .hg_archival.txt file which contains the big long 320 bit hash code
for the commit, but not the actual revision number.  (And without mercurial and
the repository you can't translate one to the other.)  You're unlikely to have a
mercurial repository without mercurial installed, so trying to parse data out
of .hg is silly (and nontrivial anyway).</p>

<p>For release tarballs I can include a pregenerated MANIFEST with values
adjusted by hand.  (Where to put it's a bit iffy, can't be packages because
it'd get deleted by cleanup_oldfiles, sources is now all stuff checked into
source control, can't put it in build because "rm -rf build" is how you
"make clean" on this project.  Putting it at the top level is clutter but
I'm not seeing a better alternative right now...)</p>

<p>As for building out of a repository, if you run ./host-tools.sh when there
isn't a build/host directory, then we know that $PATH hasn't been adjusted to
exclude hg so we can try to create a MANIFEST then.  But that's kind of
disgusting, because running host-tools.sh is supposed to be entirely optional.
This would be a non-obvious side effect, plus it wouldn't know when to rebuild
MANIFEST because package upgrades (or at least switching USE_UNSTABLE around)
aren't tied to rebuilding build/host.  The lifetime rules are all wrong.
This is ugly.</p>

<p>I suppose that when there's a .hg directory in $TOP I can symlink hg
into build/host.  That's ugly too, but possibly _less_ ugly than the
alternatives.  Hmmm....</p>

<p>Sigh.  I always get hung up on the small stuff, because that's usually
where it's least clear what the best approach is.</p>

that FWL does not require root access on the host, ever.</p>

turning it from a retirement fund into our largest entitlement program),
then Bush I spent more money in 4 years than Regan did in 8, then duh-bya
borrowed unimaginable amounts of money from China, never vetoed a single
spending measure, kept things like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq off the
main budget so it _looked_ smaller than it actually _was_.</p>

<p>In contrast, Clinton balanced the budget and actually paid it down.
Obama's made reducing the deficit a priority and is current making sure
we get a better bang for the buck even with crisis management.  (The Democrats
care what they spend money _on_.  This isn't new.)</p>

<p>Which of these two groups are accomplishing what fiscal conservatives
claim to beleive in?  Why on _earth_ would they vote for the people who
ran up the national debt?  (And oversaw a series of entirely avoidable
financial disasters from the whole enron/worldcom/arthur andersen collapse
through the mortgage industry collapse, and no-bid contracts to Haliburton
for everything from Iraq through Katrina.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>So I'm adding an option to build qemu to host-tools.sh, and it wants to use
"strip" during install.  Here's why that's problematic, starting with some
backstory:</p>

<p>What host-tools.sh does is populate a directory (build/host) with host
versions of the same build tools the target system will contain, and adjusts
$PATH to point only to that directory.  It also builds a few other things
(like distcc and genext2fs) that may not be installed on the host.  The reasons
to do this are A) it provides evidence that the target system can probably
successfully rebuild itself (since these tools are what it built with in the
first place; if nothing else you find most problems early), B) it isolates the
build from variations in host system, so you don't get different system images
when building on ubuntu/fedora/gentoo, C) we're building everything from
source, even the tools we build with. :)</p>

<p>The exception to this is the host toolchain.  In order to build from source,
you need something to compile _with_, and it's the host's job to provide a
toolchain you can compile host binaries with.  (We build a known cross compiler
that produces _target_ binaries, but not for building host binaries.  If the
one supplied to us by the environment doesn't work, something is wrong.)</p>

<p>So instead of trying to build a host compiler from source, it creates
symlinks to the existing one in build/host:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
for i in ar as nm cc gcc make ld
do
  [ ! -f "${HOSTTOOLS}/$i" ] &&
    (ln -s `PATH="$OLDPATH" which $i` "${HOSTTOOLS}/$i" || dienow)
done
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I.E. the seven binaries it's creating symlinks to are ar, as, nm, cc, gcc,
make, and ld.</p>

<p>Notice it's _not_ creating a symlink to is the host's "strip".  It doesn't
build one from source, either.  (It's in binutils.)  This lack is intentional:
a common cross mistake when cross compiling is to use the host's "strip" to
strip target binaries.  This can sort of work sometime, because usually your
target's using ELF too (although it could be using another format like
binflat), and on some targets the sections will match up.  And on others you
get subtle bugs that are a pain to track down (like the bugs I got when
stripping the *.a and *.o files).</p>

<p>So if something we're cross compiling accidentally calls the host strip
instead of the target strip, I _want_ the build to break so we notice the
problem.  Easy way to do that, don't have the host strip in the $PATH.</p>

<p>So I can add "strip" to build/host.  It's easy.  I just don't _want_ to,
it's not there for a _reason_.</p>

<p>Except that qemu refuses to install without "strip".  It's possible to build
pre-stripped binaries (-s option to gcc), but qemu isn't doing that.  It's
possible to just install the binaries verbatim (with debug symbols), but qemu
won't do that.</p>

<p>What qemu is doing is using the busybox "install" command with the -s
option, which shells out to strip.  I could patch busybox to not do that, but
the way the patch infrastructure works is that setupfor patches the package
every time, both the version we build for the host and the one for the target.
The target's doing a native build, it has a native "strip", so using install
-s is ok in that context and breaking it is bad.</p>

<p>I could temporarily add a symlink to "strip" right before qemu, and then
remove it afterwards.  That's too ugly for words.  Not going there.</p>

<p>So I'm down to modifying how qemu installs.  I can patch the qemu source to
remove the -s, or I can just do the install by hand.  Doing the install by
hand has the benefit that I can skip installing the docs and stuff (which I
really don't want in build/host anyway, that _should_ just be the executables
except that qemu can't run without the pc-bios directory).</p>

<p>That's why I reimplemented qemu's install as a "find" and two instances of
cp, and now you know.</p>

<p>The reasons I'm building qemu from source now is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Because I can.  (I.E. It's now possible to build qemu from source
without requiring gcc 3.x on the host,)</p></li>
<li><p>Older version of qemu don't support lots of the targets we now make
system images for.</p></li>
<li><p>The current release (0.10.1) needs patches to support powerpc and
sh4.</p></li>
<li><p>Having it in build/host makes life easier for run-from-build.sh.</p></li>
<li><p>It turns out that the smoke test at the end of cross-compiler.sh (using
qemu application emulation to run a target "hello world") hasn't worked for a
_long_ time.  (Oops.  It skips it if the appropriate qemu target isn't
installed, and if it's not in build/host cross compiler won't ever find
it...)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I also note that host-tools.sh only builds qemu from source when
HOST_BUILD_EXTRA=1.  (It takes longer than building a complete system image,
this sucker's expensive to compile.)  If that variable isn't set, it symlinks
it from the host the way the host toolchain is.</p>

<p>Ok, reinstalled my laptop with Kubuntu 8.04 LTS.  (Because Ubuntu 8.10
refused to unhork itself, and it now has so many redundant and conflicting
layers of unnecessary infrastructure that I don't have a _clue_ what actually
triggered its descent into madness.)</p>

<p>The checklist for turning a fresh install into something useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select your wireless network, log in.</li>
<li>Run the package updates.</li>
<li>Drag menu->system->konsole to the task bar.</li>
<li>Fish around for the hidden volume control (click the sound control in the
task bar, select mixer, PCM slider) and max it so sound works again.  (No,
this doesn't show up in aumix, nor is it the "master" slider that the
task bar sound control shows you by default.)</li>
<li>Now that the sound's back, make it SHUT UP:
<ul>
<li>Fire up a Konsole window, settings->bell->none, settings->save as default.</li>
<li>sudo rm /lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/input/misc/pcspkr.ko</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sudo /bin/bash then set a password for root.<li>
<li>sudo ln -sf vimrc /etc/vim/vimrc.tiny</li>
<li>echo export EDITOR=vi >> ~/.profile</li>
<li>sudo ln -sf sleep.sh /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh</li>
<li>sudo aptitude install libc6-dev manpages-dev mercurial subversion pdftk g++-4.2 libncurses5 xmlto gcj-4.2 libsdl1.2-dev diffstat patch bluetooth flashplugin-nonfree</li>
<li>sudo aptitude remove mlocate</li>
<li>Fire up kaffeine, try to play a video.  It'll pop up a request to install
yet more codecs, do it.</li>
<li>Right click on the desktop pager, select 6 desktops.</li>
<li>Configure taskbar: don't "show windows for all desktops", group similar tasks->never.</li>
<li>Set the home directory back up.  (In this case copy * from the old
one, and then iterate through .* to see what's needed.)</p>
<li>Set email back up (Big long complicated and evil.  Copy archives and kmail
config, setup my hack2.py sending script (remember to ssh to the server as
root to set up the known_hosts entry), setup the filchmail.py fetching
script...)</li>
<li>sudo rm /usr/bin/korgac (for kmail)</li>
<li>Apply <a href=notes-2008.html#26-05-2008>the patch</a> to unbreak mercurial
with regards to symbolic links.  (Note the file's randomly moved to /usr/share/python-support/mercurial/mercurial/util.py now.)</li>
<li>Install apache2, cp landely.net/loopback.conf /etc/apache2/httpd.conf</li>
</ul>

<p>Sigh.  Done...  And kmail has been hung trying to launch for 10 minutes.
(Eating 100% cpu, albeit only on one processor.)  That's probably not a good
sign...  Nope, it worked its way through.  Regenerating the indexes, perhaps?</p>

<p>The 2.6.29 kernel and qemu 0.10.1 both dropped while I was out.  Of
course.</p>

<a name="22-03-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#22-03-2009">March 22, 2009</a></h2>
<p>I'm trying to figure out if I hate SELinux or Ubuntu more.  Last night, in
the middle of some light web surfing and programming (as my normal user, not
root), my laptop decided to go nuts, with the video card showing snow.  A
quick hard boot later, and everything seemed well... except that I couldn't
talk to the network.  Suspecting a heat problem, I gave it the night to cool
off, and now it's morning and the network problem hasn't changed.</p>

<p>The _weird_ part is that the wireless card is associating with the
access point, and can see the ~2 dozen other access points in the area,
so it's both sending and receiving fine at the hardware level.  Dropping
down to root, I try to ping the access point:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
root@driftwood:~# ping 192.168.2.1
PING 192.168.2.1 (192.168.2.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted

</blockquote>

<p>That's as root.  I can't sendmsg _as_root_.  What the?  When I'm logged in
as root, I can format the hard drive.  I'd BETTER be able to talk to the
network.</p>

<p>Possibly it's the network card giving bad errors.  Intel's wireless driver
still has a horrible binary blob, last I checked.  And it's crapping all over
dmesg:</p>

<p>And so on for quite some time.  As far as I can tell, that's a log of all
the packets userspace tried to send and got permission denied for.  (I can
only assume this is the stupid selinux permission stuff.  I haven't figured
out how to switch it _off_ yet.  I haven't go the selinux userspace packages

<span id=programming>
<p>So I want to make build-static-toolchains.sh run multiple qemu instances
in parallel.  It should be possible to make hda read only, provide a separate
hdb for each instance, and even run genext2fs on build/sources to create
a read-only hdc.</p>

<p>There's a couple infrastructure problems here.  The first is that FWL has
a bad relationship with mke2fs, tune2fs, and fsck.ext2.  Busybox
no longer provides them (it did circa 1.2.2, but the implementations were
horrible and got removed).  It's currently only used by run-from-build.sh,
and I really don't want to suck in e2fsprogs in host-tools.sh for that.
But gentoo doesn't put /usr/sbin in a normal user's $PATH, and that's
where they live, so I have to jump through hoops to access them.  Right
now said ugly hoop jumping (adding /sbin:/usr/sbin to $PATH if mke2fs isn't
found) is limited to run-from-build.sh, but the need for multiple hdb
instances is a second use for this.</p>

<p>So I can't rely on them being easily accessible on the host, I don't want to
build e2fsprogs in host-tools.sh.  The long term fix is to add them to the lua
toybox, but that's not immediately useful.</p>

<p>I could move the $PATH mangling to sources/include.sh (grab those three
binaries the way I grab the host toolchain), but the adjusted path in
build/host doesn't contain qemu.  (Now that 0.10.0 builds with gcc 4 I'm
pondering adding qemu back to host-tools.sh, but that's a separate issue.)
Adding things to $OLDPATH is ugly because then it's not the old path
anymore.</p>

<p>The OLDPATH thing is actually kind of annoying because I need to use
genext2fs and qemu from the same context in build-static-toolchains.sh,
and right now no $PATH is guaranteed to have both of those.  Sigh.  I could
get away with this before, but it was wrong and it's coming back to bite
me.  And to be honest, right now I need to apply two patches to qemu 0.10.0
(to get ppc and sh4 working)... Ok, time to clean up host-tools.sh.</p>

<p>It turns out Grischka is using a <href=http://repo.or.cz/w/tinycc.git>git
tree for tinycc</a>.  (I _think_ this is an active repository.  The last
commit to it was three and a half months ago, but then again that could just
be the rate tcc development's been going.)  He's still syncing the cvs
repository from it, but if he agrees to _stop_ doing that I'd be willing to
contribute to this repository.  (Yeah, I need to learn more git stuff, what
little I knew has gone rusty.  But I have no fundamental objections to git the
way I do cvs.)</p>

<p>Hmmm... Building qemu in build/host is nontrivial, because qemu
wants to install a pc-bios directory and needs to know where to find it.
(Which means that you provide a $prefix and it throws stuff under there.
I want the binaries to go in "build/host" and it wants to put them in
"$prefix/bin".)  There isn't currently really a place to _put_ the pc-bios
directory.  I could compensate by supplying -L to qemu, but then it
has to know if it's running from host-tools.sh or from the host system.
(I suppose I could throw logic to detect this case into run-from-build.sh,
but what I'm trying to do here is simplify that...)</p>

<p>Maybe having a build/host/pc-bios directory isn't _too_ disgusting.
(It means the qemu we build would have a hardwired absolute path, but
build/host never really claimed to be relocatable, did it?)  I'm not sure
what happens if you try to run "pc-bios" out of $PATH if it's a directory.
Shouldn't come up much, but still...</p>

<p>Also, the qemu build is _long_, and hugely memory intensive.  (Mostly
due to translate.c, which causes cc1 to peak at over 20% memory usage on my
laptop according to top, which is about 400 per instance.  When two of 'em
happen at once with -j 2, the sucker can go totally swap happy.)  If all you
want to do is build a cross compiler or a system image, and not run the result
locally, building that is painful...</p>

<p>Ok, just built it with -j 2, with 728 megs free according to /proc/meminfo
so the sucker has no excuse to swap.  Totem is eating 12% of one CPU (catching
up on my podcasts, currently countdown), and the system otherwise idle.  (Killed
npviewer.bin just to be sure.)  How long does qemu 0.10.0 take to build...</p>

<blockquote><pre>
real    16m42.256s
user    26m51.669s
sys     1m55.315s
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that's about how long it takes to run the entire rest of the
build.  If this goes into host tools, it needs a config option.  (Darn it,
symlinking all the qemu-system-* into build/host is being evil.  Tab completion
can give me a list of everything in $PATH starting with a known prefix, ala
"qemu-system-[tab][tab]".  But doing this from the command line... How?
I can't do it with "which", can't do it with "whereis".  I suppose I can run
the $PATH through sed and iterate, but that's kind of disgusting...</p>

<p>Sigh.  Actually implementing this is easy.  Figuring what the right
thing to do actually is: hard.</p>
</span>

<p>Went outside and painted over the fresh grafitti in the alley.  Got a mild
case of heatstroke and sunburn (remembered that Fade's bike had some
spray sunblock on it after about an hour of painting in direct Texas sunlight),
managed to whack the front of my right shin quite impressively in the process
(they can swell up; good to know), got paint all over one of the dining chairs,
destroyed two paintbrushes, and destroyed our broom.  But I got it done, and
I'm pretty happy with the result.  (I'm getting better at this, hopefully
next time I have to do it it won't take 2 hours and will cause less collateral
damage.  1pm was not the optimal time to start this, even in March.  Diet
Rockstar energy drink was not the optimal beverage to stay hydrated, switching
to tea for the second half worked much better.  Oh, and we still don't have
duct tape but we _do_ have blue painter's tape.  My leg hurts.)</p>

<p>I want to up Netflix to at least 4 disks.  (Mark has 8, it apparently
costs him $45/month which is what he was spending on cable.)  There are
tons of Doctor Who DVDs out now, including some really good episodes I
want to show Fade.  (Invasion of Time is out!  Woo!).  Especially since
Hulu started being stupid with blatant watermarks over the video you're trying
to watch.  (Ok, Fade can watch a lot of these videos online on her mac.
I expect that'll be really nice in about 3-5 years.  But for right now having
more disks to choose from means we'd watch them more often.)</p>

<p>Looking at the non-credit courses at UT.  Turns out the second wave of
them start right after spring break, I.E. next week.  This means I didn't
wmiss the remedial scribbling class I wanted to take (ahem, "Drawing I),
it starts tuesday.  I'm also interested in "Aerobics - Lunchtime" (1010.601,
18 meetings, MWF Mar 30-May 8, 12-1 pm).  I'm a bit confused about "Xtreme
Abs", which claims to run from 7:30-7:45 twice a week.  15 minutes?  Um...
ok?  I wonder if Fade would be interested in the Ballroom Dance class (two
sections, one meets mondays and one meets wednesdays, both starting next
week).  I might be interested in "Japanese for beginners" if it wasn't
the same time as the drawing I course.</p>

<p>Watching various Ted talks.
<a href=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/adam_savage_s_obsessions.html>Adam
Savage</a> is geekier than me, and I am deeply impressed.
It's interesting that <a href=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/don_norman_on_design_and_emotion.html>Don Norman</a>
has wandered from usability to aesthetics, but the talk was so-so.
<a href=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/dan_ariely_on_our_buggy_moral_code.html>Dan Ariely</a> is a behavioral economist, which is a specialization
I didn't even know existed, and gave a _marvelous_ talk.  I also really
liked <a href=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/dan_gilbert_researches_happiness.html>Dan Gilbert</a>'s (long) talk about how everybody sucks at math
in the real world (enumerating common mistakes).</p>

<p>Sigh.  A large "Viz Media" watermark has shown up over all the bleach
episodes on Hulu.  I don't know when this started (it wasn't there last time
I was watching them), but it's intrusive and distracting, and after an episode
and a half I realized it's taken all the fun out of watching them.  And since
I refuse to reward the importer by giving them money for making something more
annoying, I guess that means either give up on the series or track down fan
subs on bittorrent.  (I actually prefer to watch this legally... up until the
point where they get abusive.)</p>

<p>Darn it, Hulu's doing it for everything now, including The Colbert Report.
Well that sucks.  So much for watching things on hulu.  (They have a whole
page to put stuff on, and they feel the need to obscure the video itself.
That's too stupid to live.  Yes, the watermark is far more annoying than the
commercials are.  I choose to watch the commercials to support the people
legally providing me with the video, but standing between me and the video
when I'm trying to watch something is just RUDE.)  I can watch ted talks
and msnbc's podcasts and all sorts of other stuff WITHOUT prominent annoying
watermarks.</p>

<p>Ok, so it's not viz being stupid, it's hulu being stupid.  So check netflix
and see if bleach is there...  Yup, 16 disks.  Ok, add that to the queue (I've
seen several of them already, but Fade hasn't).  And worry about it later.</p>

me it might keep me awake, which instead put me to sleep.</p>

<p>The qemu 0.10.0 release doesn't work out of the box for powerpc or sh4.
The <a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2009-02/msg00727.html>patch
for sh4 -append</a> hasn't been merged yet, but is easy to apply.  The powepc
issue I tracked down yesterday is something in openbios.  A workaround is
to skip -nographic, but that makes the emulator much less useful because you
can't script it through stdin/stdout.</p>

<p>Greg Ungerer's done a <a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0903.2/01056.html>marvelous job</a>
hand-holding a git newbie like me.  (Ok, I didn't know how to fetch a
branch.  It hadn't come up before.)  Confirmed his m68k fix works, and
hopefully it'll make it into 2.6.29.</p>

<p>The sh4 native building issue was fixed by narrowing --strip-unneeded.
That was a weird symptom, but it explains why the cross compiler worked but
the native compiler didn't.</p>

<p>Finally got Stephen Dawkins' 610 kernel tested (he hasn't got a debug
adapter so he sent me a kernel to test with mine... back on the 10th.
Oops.)  It didn't work.  In theory you can tftp new firmware into a router
that's in the process of booting, it stops and waits about 3 seconds for you to
do this, then continues booting with the firmware it's got if you don't.
In practice, I've never managed to hit the window (not that I'm sure I'm even

<p>Catching up on my podcasts, watching Rachel Maddow's February 16th show
(yeah, a touch behind) where she's covering Kim Jong Il's birthday.  Am I
the only one amused that the miracles the government of North Korea is
attributing to Kim Jong Il (his birth caused pear and apricot trees to sprout
in winter, and this year his birthday created a halo around the moon) are
pretty much the same as the Roman government attributed to Jesus (he
smote a fig tree and his birth was marked by a star).  Then again I categorize
"the mother of all battles" and El Shrubbo's "mission accomplished" banner
together.  Obviously, all this propoganda is the result of Intelligent
Design, by His Noodly Appendage.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that around half the eating I do is for social reasons.
I went out to dinner with with Andrea at Whataburger last night (having just
cooked and eaten chicken), I'm meeting Mark for dinner at Texadelphia (having
just eaten leftover chicken and an apple), I regularly enjoy going out to
restaurants with Fade, biking out after midnight the only places that are
open are restaurants...</p>

<p>So, according to qemu svn 6658, the OpenBios image got updated from
OpenBios svn 450 to OpenBios svn 463.  So how do you build openbios?  Hmmm,
let's see, no ./configure, the README says it's config/scripts/switch-arch,
which supports "cross-ppc".  Ok, try that and run make.  (I haven't supplied
a cross compiler yet but presumably it'll complain when it gets to that
point...)  And it builds fourth stuff for a while, and then dies with:
<blockquote><pre>
Building OpenBIOS on amd64 for ppc
Building...error:
tail: cannot open `/build.log' for reading: No such file or directory
make: *** [build] Error 1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Well of course it can't access a file out of the root directory, I'm
running the build as a normal user.  And V=1 does nothing.  No obvious way
to make it verbose, actually, so time to grep for occurrences of "build.log"
in the source...  Ah, the bug is actually that the error reporting tries to
"tail $$$dir/build.log", and that dir should only have two $ on it.  Queue
up an email to blue swirl about it, fix my local
copy, and...  It's looking for powerpc-linux-gnu-gcc, and it's getting
that from the TARGET=powerc-linux-gnu- prefix in
config/examples/cross-ppc_rules.xml... and there isn't an obvious
way to override it at configure time.  It's generating obj-ppc/Makefile
but calling it via recursive make so overriding it on the make command line
won't even work.  Great.  Ok, edit my copy to be just powerpc-, make clean,
re-configure, set the $PATH to point to the powerpc cross compiler, re-run the
build, and...</p>

<p>Wow, I think it worked.  (I usually expect packages to put up WAY more
of a fight...)  obj-ppc/openbios-qemu.elf is 271368 bytes, the 1.0 release
version in qemu is 271336 bytes and "file" says it's a 32-bit ppc ELF...</p>

<p>Biked to the north Chick-fil-a location last night.  Adrienne called
(locked out) while I was there.  It's at least an hour and a half bike ride
each way (closer to 2) so she drove up to get the key.  I only got about 45
minutes of work done because they closed at 10, but yay exercise.</p>

<p>Mark fingered the --strip-unneeded line as screwing up all sorts of stuff.
In his case, breaking the ncurses build.  In my case, it's the reason static
linking wasn't working.  (It might also be the reason that sh4 wasn't able to
compile anything, but I can't be sure because qemu 0.10.0 won't run sh4
either.  I vaguely recall I'd patched something in qemu to make it work,
need to track down and redo that...)</p>

<p>Ok, installed svn on securitybreach, and now binary searching to see where
qemu broke powerpc.  Let's see, 6591 works, 6776 is broken, 6650 works...
It's <a href=/code/qemu/patchlist/svn-6658.patch>svn 6658</a> that broke it.
Poked the #qemu channel on freenode and the qemu mailing list.  Apparently
it only breaks -nographic.  Go figure.</p>

<p>Huh.  So Dell responded to the Macbook Air by coming out with the
<a href=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/desktop/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215900754>Dell Adamo</a>,
a system which costs $200 more than the Macbook, has a slower processor,
less powerful graphics chip, weighs a pound more, is slightly wider,

<p>Interesting.  Time magazine <a href=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1884956,00.html>estimates</a> that if California
legalized pot, it could balance their state budget by $2.3 billion/year.
That's $1.3 in tax revenue and $1 billion saved in enforcement.  (It's
california's most lucrative agricultural crop, earning $14 billion/year.)
Legalization would be personally inconvenient since I continue to be
allergic to the stuff, but other than that it seems kind of obvious,
possibly inevitable.</p>

<p>Dropped Adrienne off at SxSW this morning (she overslept; I simply hadn't
set the alarm), then returned yet another fax to my sister's realtor,
and now hanging out at the coffee shop next to Kinko's on 26th street.
The barista is _stunningly_ cute.  (Somewhat distracting, actually.)</p>

<p>Wendy at the credit union poked me about hazard insurance for Kris's
new house, and I phoned and left a message with the Nationwide office on
Far West.</p>

<p>Tested a new m68k tree from Greg Ungerer.  Didn't fix the problem (uClibc
build dies trying to generate the syscall list due to headers exported by
make headers_install #including files it didn't install), but I got him the
error message and hope for a reply.</p>

<p>Replied to an email about my tinycc fork (unrelated to resubscribing to
the mailing list, this is a college professor at Tufts who says he and his
postdoc wanted to hook my old fork up to <a href=http://www.cminusminus.org>a
different backend</a>.  Could be interesting.  (I still think qemu's tcg is
the logical backend for the thing, but _any_ work to genericize it so
the frontend and backend talk through some kind of defined interface can
only help matters.)</p>

<p>Critiqued Pavel Machek's filesystem requirements documentation some more.</p>

<p>Wrote up a quick summary of last week's 440 work and sent it to Mark so
he can do Impact Linux invoicing.</p>

<p>Heard back from the insurance guy, need to talk to an insurance guy in
Minnesota.  Right, called him, gave him the contact info for the mortgage
lady so she can tell him what kind of insurance I need.</p>

<p>Tracking down how I broke the powerpc target, checking the revision
history and building old versions until I find the one that doesn't work.
(This would go faster if I didn't keep running out of disk space.  Yeah,
I managed to fill up the new bigger drive.)</p>

<p>I'd hoped to go to some of the free SxSW interactive parties tonight,
but after being beaten to death by interrupts over the weekend I just haven't
got the energy.  Might go bike to someplace to huddle with my laptop...</p>

<a name="15-03-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#15-03-2009">March 15, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Didn't get to update my blog yesterday.  It's 8pm and I'm keeping
Mark waiting while I stop at a restaurant to eat for the first time
today.</p>

<p>Too overscheduled.  Really in danger of burning out.  I am now officially
swap thrashing.  I spend so much time being interrupted and context switching
that I'm getting NOTHING DONE.</p>

<p>Adrienne's visiting and I have no time to spend with her.  She's free for
dinner tonight as soon as she finishes her nap; she came back from the
conference exhausted.  She's skipping the SxSW parties tonight, many of which
I could go to if I had time because they're free.  I really wanted to see
the vintage coin-op video arcade they had (free to everybody, no badge
required) at the convention center, but I never had time and it was only
there for three days ending today.</p>

<p>Fade made it off to the airport early this morning.  I didn't get to
spend a lot of time with her this week, but she's only gone for a week.</p>

<p>Mark's wanted to meet me every evening for four days now (both
because he needed help moving slightly _farther_ out of town, and because he
needs help with a big documentation task Cisco assigned him with; Mark doesn't
really do documentation).  He's my friend and I want to spend time with him,
and the technical stuff is even billable time, but with traffic it's an hour
drive each way to his apartment.  (Between errands, visiting Mark, driving
Adrienne around, and driving Fade around, I've gone through an entire tank
of gas this week.  That's kind of unusual.)</p>

<p>I'd hoped Adrienne's visit would inspire me to clean the condo (which
would have helped Fade's pre-trip stress too), and I did manage a couple
hours, but I just didn't have time to finish it.</p>

<p>The mortgage on my sister's new house was approved, although the closing
had to be rescheduled for sometime later this month (I forget when, but it's
not this week and I think it's in my email).  I need to go get some kind of
house insurance ASAP (I forget what kind, but it's in my email).  Still
haven't manage to do so, maybe I'll find time tomorrow.  (I need to call Kris
and see how she's doing.  Maybe I'll find time tomorrow.)</p>

<p>I've haven't had a chance to open the Lua book since the last time I wrote
about it.  Yes I know Gentoo From Scratch is blocked on a new useradd (because
mark doesn't want to install an old version of shadow utils for some reason)
and useradd is a toybox thing and toybox is blocked on me learning lua to
rewrite it.  I'd _love_ to have time to learn lua this week.  It's very hard
to do in 15 minute increments.  Maybe I'll find time tomorrow.</p>

<p>Spamalot was in town all this past week and I missed it.  I missed David
Schwimmer mocking Showgirls at the drafthouse.  I missed the start of the
drawing class at UT I wanted to take this semester.  Lawrence Lessig is
in town for SxSW, maybe I'll find time to meet him tomorrow.</p>

<p>I've made trivial progress tackling my todo list for the FWL 0.9.6 release
I wanted to do tomorrow.  Maybe I'll find time tomorrow.</p>

<p>Went out to Whataburger last night and carved out a couple hours to poke
at the 440 toolchain, because I'll have to do a progress report about that
tomorrow.  (I'm calling this week half-time because even with poking at two
different crosstool variants I can't say I managed more than 20 hours.)  I
duct taped something into a FWL target that _might_ look like
440 toolchain in the right light, and fired up "qemu-system-ppc -M bamboo",
and found out that the 440 processor isn't _implemented_.  It's just a stub,
the bamboo board just emulates the system-on-chip peripherals and otherwise
uses a 405 processor emulation.  (I'm embarassed this took me until yesterday
to discover, but I didn't have anything to _test_ before then.)</p>

<p>I'd love to go visit the doctor to get antibiotics for the sinus infection
that's preventing me from sleeping for more than a couple hours at a time.
I've meant to go ever since I got back from Pennsylvania.  (Of course the
paperwork for better health insurance never got filled out anyway.)
Maybe I'll find time for both tomorrow.</p>

<p>There are so many other things that have fallen through the cracks.  Solar
asked me to cut new FWL binaries on friday, and Vladmir Dronnikov's wanted those
for months.  Haven't found time.  I need to set up the nightly build cron job,
which means I need to fix static linking, see "FWL todo list" above.  It's
just a simple binary search regression test, I could sit down and figure it
out in an hour or so.  (Might be when I fiddled with the wrapper, might be
when I started stripping the libraries.)  And the m68k guys sent me a link to
an atari emulutor that can apparently run a m68k kernel (aranym.org) but I
haven't looked at it yet, nor have I followed up on the m68k headers_install
issue in 2.6.29.  Maybe I'll find time tomorrow.</p>

<p>I need to poke Eric about the C++ paper (he says he emailed me a draft
earlier this week, but I didn't get it, and he's not getting my email either;
sounds like a local delivery routing issue on grelber we need to track down).
I haven't been to Starbucks in weeks.  I need to get some exercise, and a
haircut.  My current car insurance card expired on the 5th (I think they sent
us a new one, but dunno where it is).  I need to hire a lawyer to show that
Stafford idiots that when they gave me a "failure to show proof of insurance"
ticket I did, in fact, have insurance (the card fell under the passenger
seat).  I need to deliver those shirts to Reese.  I haven't spoken to Stu
in weeks, I need to resubmit the perl removal patches, I may _never_ get
QEMU weekly news updated...</p>

<p>Sigh.  I don't even REMEMBER most of the things I have to do, they're
just piling up into a big wave.  But Mark called, and I guess I've kept him
waiting long enough.  Off to do documentation...</p>

<p>Ok, got some documentation edited over at Mark's, took Adrienne to dinner
around 1 AM at the 24 hour IHOP (after visiting a 24 hour wal-mart and walgreens
trying to find a supplemental battery pack for her smart phone), going to
bed in hopes of getting up early in the morning and tackling backlog.  May
just turn my phone _off_ all day to avoid interruptions.</p>

<p>Lua books (2): check.  Roxette "Look Sharp" album (to which I learned C):
ripped, converted to mp3, and shoehorned into rockbox (which has the most
horrible user interface, but oh well).  Soda refills (Einstein's this time):
check.</p>

<p>Not a bad language, really.  It's firmly in the whitespace agnostic
camp, not even requiring semicolons (which to be honest, aren't usually needed
in C either; the compiler tells you when you've dropped one).  It uses
"end" in place of closing curly brackets, and makes it mandatory instead
of having magic single line contexts after if statements and such.  21
reserved keywords. -- starts a single line comment, --[[ and --]] are
multi-line comments.  Variables are created by assigning to them, and reading
a nonexistent variable return "nil" (instead of throwing an exception, ala
Python).</p>

<p>I love this Album.  Yeah it's old, but it's great to program to.
(Joyride's ok too.)</p>

<p>Ok, I'm to section 1.3 in "Programming in Lua" and I've hit the first
place I want to smack the author: "Global variables do not need declarations.
You simply assign a value to a global variable to create it... if your
variable is going to have a short life, you should use a local variable."
Ok, _HOW_?  YOU'VE NEVER MENTIONED LOCAL VARIABLES BEFORE NOW.  This section
offers no way to distinguish between local and global variables.  I'm GUESSING
it's a scope issue, but that's just a guess.  Throwing me a forward reference
here would be very reassuring; the author did not do this.</p>

<p>Wow Rockbox really is a horrible music player.  (It works fine, it's just
a pain to pause and unpause when I get a soda refill.  Plus putting music
_into_ it requires an act of congress.)  I miss the KDE one.  After several
months of daily use, I think I can confidently say that I hate everything
about Gnome.  (I still have my little orange "iPod Klepto" around here
somewhere, but apparently it's not in my backpack.  Presumably in the car.
Bit fiddly to use my giant noise cancelling headphones with a device that's
maybe 1/20th their size, but it's got the "big prominent pause button" thing
down.  Hopefully there's a way to get it to play things in order rather
than random shuffle.  I'll have to look into it.)</p>

<p>Dear Gnome console developers: putting the close button for
the last tab right above to the up arrow for the scroll bar is DEEPLY
STUPID.  The Konsole people figured out not to do that _years_ ago, and I
just closed 3 tabs I wanted to keep in a slightly misaligned attempt to scroll
up.  (This is unrelated to the above statement that I hate everything about
Gnome, which predated me doing this.)</p>

<p>The original crosstool only _claims_ to have support for the 440.  If you
actually try to build it, the thing breaks trying to build the first package
(gcc 3.3.6, which is _really_ strange because I _told_ it to build gcc
4.1.1, which is the latest version it has).  Looked at its config and
it _seems_ the magic is --with-cpu=440 for gcc.  Dunno if I need to tell
binutils something (it didn't try to build binutils before trying
to build gcc 3.3.6... I don't get it either).</p>

<p>Broke down and resubscribed to the tcc mailing list a couple days back
to ask if CVS was dead yet.  No official response so far, but I replied
to the one guy who commented with a big long rant about what tcc SHOULD be
doing.  (Do the busybox swiss-army-executable thing and replace binutils,
grab TCG from QEMU and use it as your code generator, clean up the path mess,
try to build real packages... The usual.  The kind of things I was working on
when I left.  Progress made so far: zero.  Oh well.)  They'll probably say
CVS isn't dead, and then I'll go away for 6 months again.  It's a bit like
groundhogs day: I pop my head up, see CVS, and go away for 6 more months.</p>

<p>Once again searching for a 68k emualtor to run the m68k target on,
since qemu's 68k support is just coldfire.
I found the "uae" and "xmess-x" packages in Ubuntu, which in theory might
both be able to load and run a 68k Linux kernel, but both projects are
too insular to actually have obvious contact info for anybody I can ask
about them.  The m68k linux site is all about using real hardware, and
doesn't mention a single emulator.  Sad, really...</p>

<p>Punt that as a tangent I haven't got time for right now, focus back
on clearing the deck for the new ppc440 target.</p>

<p>The last time I tried to get gcc 4.2 working was
<a href="notes-2008.html#31-01-2008">over a year ago</a>, but I seem to be
making the same mistakes in the same order.  (Up to and including setting
ac_cv_path_RANLIB_FOR_TARGET="$ARCH-ar" instead of $ARCH-ranlib.)  Oh well,
I vaguely recall the debugging steps I did last time, so it's not taking
nearly so long to fix.  (Checking my old blog doesn't help, the granularity
of what I blathered about wasn't high enough.  I thought I had the old patch
saved somewhere, but if so I can't find it.)</p>

<p>I'm pretty happy staying with gcc 4.2.1 until a gcc alternative comes
around because the FSF seems to have gone completely insane:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href=http://www.suckless.org/GSoC2009>We are also concerned</a>
about recent attempts to implement the C front-end of gcc
in C++. We believe that is a bad decision in general (due to demanding C++ as
bootstrapping environment) and would like to get rid of the gcc dependency
for these reasons.</p></blockquote>

<p>You'd think even the FSF wouldn't be crazy enough to rewrite
their C compiler in C++, but you'd be wrong...</p>

<p>Sigh.  Once again, moving to gcc 4.2.1 fails to fix _anything_.  The
"duplicate .personality directive" thing with arm eabi is still there,
now m68k is broken...  No, that was broken by the 2.6.29-rc7 kernel.</p>

<p>Note to self: updating multiple things at once is a bad way to debug
anything.  Fix stuff and commit it, THEN upgrade the next thing.  (This
is why I'm holding off on moving sources/packages up a level so "sources"
is all stuff stored in mercurial without other files mixed in there.)</p>

<p>Trying to close down for a FWL release, but I still need to install 4.2.1,
get the 2.6.29 kernel working smoothly, fix arm eabi,
fix sh4 native building, fix native static linking (which is blocking the
nightly cron job), fix the "new" pthreads implementation in uClibc, add a
PPC440 (bamboo) board, fix sparc, redo the USE_UNSTABLE stuff, move
sources/packages up a level, make sure uClibc 0.9.30.1 didn't break
anything...</p>

I emailed Mark a link to my 3 waves articles

heap for years, but Penguicon was on the todo heap for 3 years before it
actually happened.)</p.

<p>I should catch up on <a href=/qemu>this</a> first, though.  And find
somebody to hand <a href=http://kernel.org/docs>this old thing</a>
off to.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, if I was still involved with Penguicon I'd try to get
<a href=http://www.lessig.org/blog/2009/03/john_conyers_and_open_access.html>Lawrence
Lessig and John Conyers</a> on a panel to talk about copyright.
The reason that's particularly relevant is that Conyers is a congressman
from Michigan's 14th district (I.E. Detroit), so if the Penguicon guys wanted
to lobby against him in the primary it would _mean_ something, so he'd want
to listen to them.  And Lessig would want to bend his ear something fierce,
and that would be worth seeing.</p>

<p>But I doubt the current lot would think of it, or bother to do anything
about it if they did.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Today while emailing the Armadillocon panels guy,
I wound up looking at

of me throwing
<a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2mj-Sq2oeo>Liquid nitrogen into a
swimming pool</a> years ago.
Back when the Penguicon concom were doing the "Oh no, nitrogen, it'll kill
us all" thing (hint: before it was deployed at Penguicon, which was after
we'd done it at Linucon _twice_) I wrote up an
analysis of
<a href=http://www.penguicon.org/pipermail/concom/2006-April/001044.html>how
dangerous it really is</a>, at least from a suffocation standpoint.
(Summary: not as much as you'd think, although you can always drown in your
bathtub if you try.)</p>

<p>It's amazing to watch people deeply, deeply clueless about something,
with no firsthand experience, try to warn others about the dangers of it.
Liquid nitrogen is about as dangerous as boiling water, which isn't to say it
can't hurt you, but fleeing in terror is probably not a measured response
to the situation.  No, the pool wouldn't freeze solid from one bowl of LN2.
No, it wouldn't cause your arm to shatter.  (Flash-freezing _anything_ bigger
than a grape is hollywood theatrics, even if you discount
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidenfrost_effect>the ledenfrost
effect</a>.  The specific heat of the material isn't that high, the quantities
involved are fairly small, and there are properties like "thermal conductivity"
(read "insulation") that come into play to prevent anything more than surface
burns.  I've been stung by LN2, but it never even left a red mark.  My
friend Reese had a whole bowl dumped in her lap (by somebody who was looking
at the pretty girl and not where he was pouring during an ice cream making
session) and she wound up with a nasty looking burn down her thigh (somewhere
between first and second degree, some blistering but not much); she said
she'd gotten worse spinning fire.  And Mark grabbed a runaway vapor hose
whipping around when the phase separator shattered at the first Linucon
(it's sort of a metal sponge on the end of the hose that keeps the pressure
contained so liquid comes out instead of a 3000 psi stream of gas; somebody
let go of the hose after filling a bowl and it whacked against the side of the
metal tank while still frozen from use, and it shattered).  Mark had to hold
on to the hose (no glove) with one hand while turning the tank's nozzle off
with the other, and the last joint of his middle finger on that hand swelled
up and essentially turned into a giant blister, but it healed with no permanent damage.</p>

<p>Yes, I was wearing flip-flops in the video.  I always wear flip-flops,
but in this case they turn out to be recommended because shoes can trap the
liquid against your skin, or absorb it.  The _TOWEL_ was the most dangerous
part about what I was doing because it could absorb LN2 and hold it against
my skin (rather than letting droplets skitter off like water on a hot
griddle).  But I didn't have anything better (the metal was painfully cold,
think Minnesota in February), small splashes would evaporate
(room temperature is over 200 degrees celsius hotter than liquid
nitrogen, it boils instantly on contact with _anything_), and if it started
to sting my hand badly enough it felt like I'd get an actual burn I could
always I dump the bowl on the ground and step back.  (That would give a
similar cloud of fog, but not as much as the pool.  The fog's water vapor,
don't you know.  Nitrogen's as transparent as you'd expect something making
up 78% of the atmosphere to be.)</p>

<p>People who have little or no firsthand experience with fire think if you
touch a match to a log or a person it'll go up in a blaze instantly, when in
reality you can pinch out a candle flame with your fingers and getting a
campfire lit can be serious work in damp places like michigan.  Liquid
nitrogen's the same: yes it's cold, no it's not magic, no matter what
hollywood likes to show.</p>

<p>Several of the commentors confused it with liquid helium (according to
the guy at the UT cryolab that's far more dangerous, no Ledenfrost effect to
speak of so little droplets stick to your skin and burn it; also several
times more _expensive_ than LN2), and with liquid oxygen (that stuff's
a fire hazard and again significantly more expensive, but I have heard
of people making ice cream with it and they said it tasted fine.  Gasoline's
a fire hazard and we pump our own gas, so..).</p>

<p>Off to watch more bleach, then maybe actually get out and bike today.
Tomorrow morning I have to collect documentation to get to the mortgage
lady for the house I'm buying my sister, and then tackle crosstool-ng some
more.</p>

<p>I need to write a pod2man replacement in lua, so I can remove the use of
perl from the documentation build of various packages.  (Man pages are
legacy, but still hanging around...)  Yes,

the tent flap.  Just a _little_ deficit spending...</p>

<a name="07-03-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#07-03-2009">March 7, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Fade and I went to see three museums today, each of which was very very
small and proudly displayed the kind of things you tend to see hanging on
restaurant walls.</p>

<p>Watched Fade play a lot of Neverwinter Nights 2 today, now watching more
<a href=http://www.hulu.com/bleach>bleach</a> and pondering a bike ride.
(Yay exercise, now that the pollen count's down to something measurable.)
But then I couldn't watch bleach episodes...</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Downloaded crosstool-ng.  It insists I install libtool and makeinfo (well,
texinfo) before it'll finish its ./configure.  That's just sad.  An obsolete
documentation format nobody uses anymore, and a tool that makes non-ELF systems
pretend to be ELF systems (and is thus a NOP on ELF systems).</p>

<p>Ok, installed the vestigial organs it complained about, but now I don't
see any way to tell it what target I want to build a cross compiler for.
The ./configure's --help option doesn't mention it.  There's no "make help"
target.  Typing "make" by itself makes a file called "ct-ng" and some
docs files...  It's another makefile.  What an odd roundabout way of building.</p>

<p>So the documentation files are in man page format.  (Why?)  And start with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>crosstool-NG makes it easy to build cross-toolchains, and allows you to
take all the juice out of your target by configuring the different comâ
ponents of the toolchain accordingly to the targeted processor.
</blockquote>

<p>What does it mean to "take the juice out of your target", I wonder?</p>

<p>It mentions a menuconfig, but there's no "make menuconfig" target.  Tried
"make -f ct-ng menuconfig" but that complained about being unable to find
the current directory's files under "/usr/local/lib".  So I have to install
this source at an absolute path in order to use it?  That's kind of insane...</p>

<p>Ah, it expects me to "make install" the _source_code_ so it can then build
from this absolute path.  Sigh.  (I am now repeating "I'm reinstalling this
laptop when xubuntu 9.04 comes out" like a mantra.  As mantras go, it's a bit
long.)</p>

<p>It doesn't autodetect $CPUS, it has you set it by hand in menuconfig.
Lots of other things I use --options for, it sets in menuconfig (including
things like "exit after downloading source code" where menuconfig seems an
outright INSANE way to do it).  It has a "Use obsolete features" selector
but even when I don't select that it defaults to binutils 2.16.1 (and
lets me select) and kernel 2.6.26 (and lets me select up through 2.6.27
something).  Oh wow, it's got a config option for the gcc "-pipe" flag.
Is this an implementation detail the user should be bothered with?
And what's up with "Kernel verbosity" here?</p>

<p>Heh, yeah I heard that gcc 4.3 now needs additional random external
libraries (gmp and mpfr).  Yet more reason to look into other compilers that
aren't maintained by crazy people.  I don't think gcc 4.2.1 (the last GPLv2
release) was afflicted with that, though.</p>

<p>Why does this thing have config options with only one entry?  "C compiler
(gcc)"... is a menu with one thing you can select.  "Toolchain type (cross)"
is another one.</p>

<p>Ok, it's configured for generic powerpc.  I'll have to dig up 440 options
later (and make a uClibc config for it), but let's see if the build can
download the source tarballs first...</p>

<p>Huh, "Directory '' does not exist. Will not save downloaded tarballs to local
storage".  That's kind of crazy.  Ok, tell it "walrus"... and it complains
that doesn't exist either, I have to mkdir walrus for it.  It's also
complaining I "did not specify the build system".  What does that even MEAN?
Isn't crosstool-ng a build system for cross compiler toolchains?</p>

<p>Where the heck did /home/landley/x-tools come from?  I never asked for
that.  It's making random directories in my home directory...  (Ah, it's
part of the default .config, CT_PREFIX_DIR.  That's _INSANE_.</p>

<p>They really expect this sucker will only ever be run on a dedicated build
system.</p>

<p>Here's a message Linus Torvalds wrote back in 2000
<a href=http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Kernel/usr-src-linux-symlink.html>railing
against something similar</a>.  Hardwiring absolute paths into your
build system is a BAD IDEA, and this is not a new observation.  (The
phrase "locality of reference" comes to mind...)</p>

<p>But it's worse than that.  It's not just that I am _in_ a directory, so
if you need to put the output somewhere, here (or a subdirectory of here) is
the logical place.  No, it's that the build is already reading .config
relative to where I am, so I have to build in this directory.  The dependency
on the current directory already exists, and they add an absolute hardwired
output path on TOP of that.  MADNESS!</p>

<p>Ok, so that directory contains a build.log (why not just spit it out
to stdout???) that says:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
[ALL  ]    bzip2: Compressed file ends unexpectedly;
[ALL  ]     perhaps it is corrupted?  *Possible* reason follows.
[ALL  ]    bzip2: Inappropriate ioctl for device

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>That was while attempting to decompress the linux-2.6.27.6 kernel tarball
it just downloaded.  Left to its own devices, this build script couldn't
competently download and extract a tarball.</p>

<p>Where's the corrupted tarball?  The "walrus" directory it complained about
is empty, "find" says it's in targets/tarballs.  So I hit ctrl-c to kill the
build because it complained it wouldn't save the tarballs locally until I
created a directory, and it kept the partially downloaded tarball, and then
didn't notice it was

<p>This is really horrible.  How do people use this thing?  (I guess there's
a reason somebody's willing to pay _me_ to fiddle with it rather than do it
themselves...)</p>

<p>And the frightening part?  This package is apparently considered a huge
improvement over the original crosstool.  THE MIND BOGGLES!</p>

<p>By the way, all the problems I'm complaining about here?  My build system
handled them properly before I ever _looked_ at this thing.  But _this_ is
the one everybody uses as the standard, and I've been asked to beat
a GPLv2 ppc-440-uClibc toolchain out of it.  Right...</p>

<p>I deleted everything out of targets/tarballs and reran the build.  So
far I've gotten "4:43" ( a minute and second counter) of a twirling
bar "progress indicator" that doesn't actually indicate progress, just that
the sucker hasn't hung yet.  No indication of what file it's downloading,
how long left to go... The default output of "wget", by the way, is a progress
bar.  This thing has to go out of its way to screw it up.  And does.</p>

<p>And then it died because I hadn't provided a uClibc .config.  Ok, sort
of valid gripe, but the amount of expertise required to _use_ this tool
approaches the amount of expertise required to _create_ the tool...</p>

<p>Random bleach comments: I vaguely recall from the first time I watched
this thing that around episode 17 they started having real trouble keeping
their contexts straight.  (He got stabbed in astral form, and then his
physical body's being patched up.  Except I thought it was established that
they don't have "the matrix" style manifestation of physical wounds from
astral combat, what with Kon posessing him half the time he's away and
all...  Oh well, they'll have fewer contexts to keep track of a few episodes
from now.)</p>

<p>Hey, QEMU finally had its 0.10.0 release.  (The first one that

<p>Now at Thundercloud, meeting Fade for lunch.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>On the FWL front, armv4l, i586, mips, mipsel, and x86_64 currently boot
and build a threaded "hello world" with the native toolchain, using uClibc
0.9.30.1 and linux-2.6.29-rc7.  This means armv5l, i686, m68k,
powerpc, sh4, and sparc aren't, and need to be fixed.</p>

<p>Two of those failures (m68k and sparc) have been completely broken all
along, so there's nothing new there.  The armv5l problem is that I'm halfway
through converting it to eabi, and the toolchain isn't liking me, and the
problem with sh4 is that the native toolchain still isn't finding _init and
_fini out of crti.o (but the cross toolchain is; go figure).  The powerpc
problem seems to be a kernel thing; it's just not booting.  (Or possibly
it's booting fine but not attaching the serial device to /dev/console.)</p>

<p>The i686 problem is that I switched it to the "new" pthreads instead
of the "old" pthreads.  Yes, uClibc has two complete pthreads implementations,
and is about to gain a _third_ threading implementation (NPTL), and Bernhard
doesn't see this as a problem.  I tried to eject the "new" one (which never
worked) before 0.9.30 came out, but Bernhard wouldn't go for it.  Now
Denys and I are trying to eject the "old" one, which involves debugging
the "new" one.  So debugging there...</p>

<p>Looking at why hw-uml doesn't work.  User Mode Linux 2.6.28 doesn't work
when built on an Ubuntu 8.10 host.  I've tracked it down to one of the
changes that went in between 2.6.27 and 2.6.28-rc1, so now it's time
to binary search between hg 110878 (works) and 118520 (broken).</p>

<p>Binary searching with Mercurial is fairly straightfoward.  I
<a href="notes-2008#27-01-2008">wrote about it</a> last year, it's mostly
just binary searching the sequence numbers of a range, the tricky
bit is if you track it down to a commit that's a merge, look at the the two
parent commits and figure out which one of them exhibits the problem.
114000 worked, 116000 worked, 117500 worked, 118000... doesn't build,
it has an error in the block layer.  Well, that can be configured out
if we're using hostfs (and we enable CONFIG_EMBEDDED)...  And it
doesn't boot init if I switch it off.  Did it _used_ to work with the
block layer switched off?  (Check 114000 again...  Nope, hostfs doesn't
work without the block layer.  I wonder why that is?)  Ok, 117961 is
the start of a branch... and that works.  117980 fails.  117970 works.
117975 worked, 117978 failed, 117977 worked.  It's
<a href=http://kernel.org/hg/linux-2.6/rev/117978>117978</a>.  Which is
WEIRD because that only affects kconfig files.  Ok, so what impact does
it have on the .config?  The symbol "CONFIG_3_LEVEL_PGTABLES=y" goes away.
That sounds kind of important...  Yup, there's the bug.  The kconfig
"lack of visibility means it doesn't get written out" insanity strikes
again.  Still stuck with that design flaw, after all these years...</p>

<p>Poked the kernel list.  Might be fixed before 2.6.29 ships, but really,
has NOBODY used UML on x86-64 since 2.6.27?  This broke in 2.6.28-rc1,
and was broken in 2.6.28, and is still broken in 2.6.28-rc7.  As far as
I can tell, it doesn't work at ALL on x86-64.  I know KVM and lguest and
the other dozen virtualization schemes has taken a lot of the wind out of
UML's sails, but they only ever ran on platforms (ppc, x86, x86-64),
ppc was never fully merged that I know of, and then x86-64 being
dead for almost two releases...  That's not a sign of health.</p>

<p>So one easy way to bypass the VFAT patents on long filenames being asserted
in the tomtom case is to use UDF instead.  That's the file format used by
DVDs, which turns out to be writeable just fine when put on a writeable
media such as a USB key, and should be supported by windows and mac out
of the box just fine.</p>

<p>The problem is, the people who wrote the Linux mkudffs command didn't zap the
FAT file allocation table at the start of the device, so if you plug in a
device that used to be fat formatted but which you've reformatted UDF using
that broken command, it gets autodetected as FAT and you see the old root
directory.  (If you then try to do anything with those files, bad things
happen.)</p>

<p>Yeah, somebody thought that through.</p>

<p>So I now have a USB key that gets automounted as FAT by the stupid HAL
when I plug it in, and then I have to umount it and "mount -t udf /dev/sdb
/root/disk" to see the actual _files_ on it.  I need to look up the fat file
format and lobotomize it with a hex editor.  (Also, there's supposed to be
a mkfs.udf link so mkfs -t udf can find stuff, but there isn't.)</p>

<p>I suppose this gives my backups accidental not-quite-cryptographic

fiddly language which I haven't got the interest in studying it as deeply as I

there was no pressing reason to _replace_ GPLv2, most of the packages I

<p>The ball's in Eric's court on the C++ paper.  I got the updated outline
to him... day before yesterday, I think.  And yesterday I went through
the first 4 sections or so to align them with the new outline, and delivered
diffs to him.  Alas, Wesnoth put out a release today, which ate his brain.
Plus he spent half of yesterday blogging
<a href=http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=826>a patent analysis of the Tom-Tom
thing</a>, and didn't have the focus left to work on the paper afterwards.</p>

<p>So of course today Slashdot links to a much shallower analysis
done by Bruce Fscking Perens, which made Eric sigh and shake his head a bit
on the way out to dinner.  Oddly enough I sympathize: I walked away from
Penguicon and thus let Matt take it over, Eric walked away from OSI thus let
Bruce took it over, but we still move in the same circles.  Unavoidably, we
run into whoever's playing dress-up in our old clothes and roll our eyes at
how badly they do it.  But we left and life goes on.  (Still, it's nice when
you get a _competent_ successor, the way Denys is doing a great job on BusyBox,
and Eric seems happy with the current Fetchmail guys...)</p>

<p>Both the sh4 and arm eabi issues have a 50% chance or so of magically
fixing themselves if I upgrade from gcc 4.1.2 to gcc 4.2 (which I
think is the last GPLv2 release).  Given a choice between
armv4l soft float and armv5l EABI, I think the second's more interesting
anyway.  Hopefully none of the other platforms will regress...</p>

<p>Darn it, it looks like gcc 4.2.1 was the last GPLv2 release.  I'd hoped
that the bugfix-only dot releases wouldn't be gratuitously relicensed,
but this is the FSF we're talking about.  They don't really _care_ about
software, software is just a means to an end for them.  What they really
care about is cramming their political agenda down people's throats, and
these days they've become so extremist that GPL version 2 isn't restrictive
enough for them anymore.  (I'm aware of the license exception that says
building with gcc shouldn't contaminate the output, but I'm distributing
build tool binaries and I refuse to get any GPLv3 on me the same way I
refused to deal with Sun's CDDL.  Of course it would be HILARIOUS if the SFLC
sued me personally over my pet open source project, I could make that a real
PR gold mine for them given our history.  But I'd really rather not go
there.)</p>

<p>So <a href=http://www.redhat.com/about/news/prarchive/2009/agenda.html>Red
Hat's finally moving from Xen to KVM</a>.  That's only about a year and a half
overdue.  (Xen is massively overcomplicated, intrusive, and only
paravirtualization.  KVM is a QEMU accelerator, it's essentially a
successor to KQEMU that relies on the new VT extensions in newer x86_64
processors (and powerpc has an equivalent).  So you can't run it on older
hardware, but how much older hardware has the speed and memory to spare to
run instances of virtualized operating systems?  And in theory KQEMU is more
or less a drop in replacement on the older systems, but I've never gotten
that sucker to work...</p>

<p><a href=http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS21672009>According
to IDC</a> demand for computers was down in Q4 of 2008, and expected to drop
sequentially for Q1 and Q2 of this year too.  The only up news is Intel's
atom, showing the continuing shift to netbooks seriously picking up steam.</p>

<p>I need to make a genext4fs command.  In lua, as part of the new toybox.
The filesystem is out and stable as of 2.6.28...</p>

<a name="27-02-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#27-02-2009">February 27, 2009</a></h2>
<p>So Livejournal's broken again.  If you log into livejournal, your
login expires after 24 hours.  When your login expires, the next livejournal
post that gets opened responds to the dead cookie by redirecting you to
the login page.</p>

<p>The problem with this is if you leave your laptop running overnight (or
suspend/resume), the first livejournal tab you open in the morning gets
eaten by the login page.  There's no trace of the URL you were trying to
go to.  If your browser was restoring state from the last time firefox
crashed, or you did a "right click open in background tab" and then closed
the original window before looking at the tab, you've lost that page.
(Not a big deal, it _is_ just a livejournal page after all.  But ordinarily
this is safe because even if it didn't _load_ you still have the URL in
the bar.  The page has to go out of its way to wipe it, and now Livejournal
does.)</p>

<p>Yet another way the crazy Russians manage to screw up anything computer
related.  I'm definitely noticing a theme here.  (I know there _are_
some good Russian programmers, but most of them seem to move to another country
as quickly as possible.)</p>

<a name="26-02-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#26-02-2009">February 26, 2009</a></h2>
<span id=programming>
<p>Got about half the outline done yesterday, working on finishing it
today.</p>

<p>Pushed some patches upstream into uClibc.  Getting some blowback,
which is mildly amusing considering the continuing lack of a 0.9.30.1 release
and that current uClibc svn does not _compile_.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Current qemu has an "-hdc fat:/path/to/directory" option that's actually
quite nice.  The emulator reads the files and makes a read-only FAT filesystem
out of 'em.  You them "mount -o ro -t vfat /dev/hdc1 /blah" and you can
read all the files in that directory.  Alas, you can't write to it.  (And
if you forget to mount it read only, then _try_ to write to it, the virtual
drive goes catatonic and the linux kernel running inside the emulator starts
spamming the console with disk error messages.  But that's pilot error.)</p>

<p>So in theory I only need the netcat trick to get data back _out_ of
the kernel.  Although another trick I could do is call genext2fs and try to
create an hdb image that already contains all the build files, and then
run the emulator with that one.</p>

<p>The problem is, genext2fs hasn't got an "extract" mode.  I tend to view
this sort of thing as an archiver: take a directory of files and turn it
into a file, and vice versa.  That's an archiver.  Alas, the genext2fs people
do not, and I've been too distracted with other things to get back to my
own gene2fs implementation.  (Which now needs to understand
<a href=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-anatomy-ext4/index.html?ca=drs->ext4</a>,
and <a href=http://valhenson.livejournal.com/30409.html>64 bit support</a>,
and so on.  I never even got around to teaching it about the ext3 journal
(which is actually just a file dangling from a reserved inode) and
htree support.)</p>

<p>The _other_ reason I haven't been banging on toybox much lately is I'm
considering porting the whole mess to <a href=http://lua.org>lua</a>.
The project that introduced me to busybox all those years ago,
<a href=http://www.toms.net/rb/>tomsrtbt</a>, implemented the rest of its
command line utilities in lua.  This from a project that was attempting
to cram as much functionality as possible into a 1.7 megabyte floppy
image; it used a high level language analogous to Python for _size_ reasons.
It had the smallest interpreter I'd ever _seen_ and the compiled binaries
were crazy tiny as well.  Ever since it's been on my to-learn list,
but when I first poked at it most of the documentation was in
Portugese, because it's from Brazil.  Plus the way to learn it was
to buy a book, and I never bought the book.</p>

<p>Last week I asked Fade if she could buy the book.  (Ok, now there's
two of them, but that's what I get for waiting.)</p>

<p>Made the mistake of mentioning politics in front of Eric again.
His reply went on for 15 minutes, was Godwined almost immediately, and
involved (accidentally) spitting on me at least twice.  *shrug*  That's
why I try not to do that.</p>

<p>Good progress on the C++ paper.  We have plenty of material but it's
not properly organized (too many back references and forward references
and arguments we want to make with no obvious place to put 'em), so we're
doing an outline.</p>

<p>I have a fax to return to my sister's realtor.  (Still
<a href="#18-02-2009">buying Kris a house</a>.)  Got delayed a bit because
they tried to put the closing on the 4th.  I fly back to Austin on the 4th,

<p>Huh, seem to have missed a day somewhere.  I suspect half of yesterday's
entries were actually about Monday.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Eric and I are grinding away on the C++ paper.  I'm also grinding away
on a cron job to build cross compiler toolchains and system images from
the nightly uClibc snapshots.  Plus I'm sticking printfs into the
binutils code to try to figure out why arm EABI isn't working, trying to
puzzle out what's up with sh4 native builds, and if I get time I still
need to track down and beat sparc into submission..</p>

<p>The usual.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>I miss working on tinycc sometimes.  When it was linking things wrong,
I'd added a -v options (and -vvv) that made it print out what it was DOING.
The binutils ld does not have such an option.  The closest I can do is run
it under strace, except that strace is annoying to cross compile so I need
the native compiler working in order to build it..</p>

<p>The binutils build is spitting out a dozen pages of errors the first
time it tries to link anything.  It's quite impressive.  It's not finding
libc, which is odd because when I build a hello world command from the
command line, it works fine.  So _sometimes_ gcc is finding libc, and other
times it isn't.  This is kind of annoying.</p>

<p>The working linker invocation is:</p>
<blockqoute><p>
/usr/bin/../libexec/gcc/i686-unknown-linux/4.1.2/collect2 --eh-frame-hdr -m elf_i386 -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2 -L/usr/bin/../lib -L/usr/bin/../gcc/lib --dynamic-linker /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0 -rpath-link /usr/bin/../lib /usr/bin/../lib/crti.o /usr/bin/../gcc/lib/crtbegin.o /usr/bin/../lib/crt1.o /tmp/ccYO0sf5.o -lgcc --as-needed -lgcc_s --no-as-needed -lpthread -lc -lgcc --as-needed -lgcc_s --no-as-needed /usr/bin/../gcc/lib/crtend.o /usr/bin/../lib/crtn.o
</p></blockquote>

<p>The failing linker invocation is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
/usr/bin/../libexec/gcc/i686-unknown-linux/4.1.2/collect2 -v -m elf_i386 -static  -o ld-new -L/usr/bin/../lib -L/usr/bin/../gcc/lib -rpath-link /usr/bin/../lib /usr/bin/../lib/crti.o /usr/bin/../gcc/lib/crtbeginT.o /usr/bin/../lib/crt1.o ldgram.o ldlex.o lexsup.o ldlang.o mri.o ldctor.o ldmain.o ldwrite.o ldexp.o ldemul.o ldver.o ldmisc.o ldfile.o ldcref.o eelf_i386.o ei386linux.o ../bfd/.libs/libbfd.a ../libiberty/libiberty.a -lgcc -lgcc_eh -lc -lgcc -lgcc_eh /usr/bin/../gcc/lib/crtend.o /usr/bin/../lib/crtn.o

<p>And this worked a few months ago.</p>

<p>Oh, hang on.  It's -static.  Uh-huh, libc.so is working, but somehow
I've screwed up libc.a.  Right...</p>

<p>Eric posted <a href=http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=801>his GPS rant</a>.  He
_does_ do embedded development. :)</p>

<p>Eric's been downloading a season's worth of an old black and white science
fiction series via bittorrent.  It's in its third day.  This is because
Verizon's FIOS detects the use of bittorrent and throttles upstream
bandwidth to about 4k/second when it's in use.  Since the FIOS connection
is shared by everybody in the house, all downloads become insanely
slow because so many of the reply packets are being dropped.</p>

<p>This is why I didn't consider getting a Verizon cell phone when I left
sprint.  I refuse to give a dime to a company that aggressively stupid.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Made uClibc-svn build under FWL again, at least for i686.  (Needed one
patch, which I committed to the repository.)  Now building all targets to see
what else breaks...</p>

<p>Pushed a second longstanding uClibc patch upstream while I was at it.
And the need for four of the others seems to have gone away (I know I
complained about the underlying issues on the list for most of them at one
time or another)...  I think that means that now the svn uClibc should build
with no patches at all.  That's kind of impressive.  (Have to wait for another
nightly snapshot to cycle round to make sure.)</p>

<p>Slept poorly last night.  Woke up around 8am with my old "something wrong
in my head somewhere" symptoms (pinkies going all pins and needles until
I slept on the other side for a bit, to get the chest pains I once went to
the ER for).  Couldn't get back to sleep for a couple hours.  Considering
I went to bed at 5am, that was bad.  Cathy woke me up to go to breakfast
at 11am, I've been a bit distracted and grumpy all day because this is
the third day I haven't gotten to bed until 5am.</p>

<p>I feel I'm being antisocial by not keeping a sufficiently day schedule.
Need to get to bed earlyish tonight, but at night after everybody goes
to bed I spend five more minutes with my laptop and it's quiet and I get
stuff done and I look up and it's 5am...</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Got Eric another draft of the C++ paper today.  He still hasn't quite
merged all of the one I sent him last time, but I wrote more material
anyway.  (He's also writing a rant about how GPS standards are screwed
up.)</p>

<p>Poking at sh4 some more.  I'm not sure if running the sh4 system image
under qemu is insanely slow because the kernel .config is wrong (I know it's
not finding the realtime clock, perhaps there are related delay sources)
or if it's just that the qemu target is not remotely optimized yet.
I need to figure out how to profile it.  Build strace inside the thing,
perhaps, but when building "hello world" takes 15 seconds, that's kind
of iffy...</p>

<p>Nobody's responded to my post to the uClibc list about the linking issue.
I tried hexediting the
".init" and ".fini" in crti.o into "_init" and "_fini", but it didn't affect
the linker funkiness.  I'm comparing the crti.S source against the assembly
of other platforms, and against crt1.S in sh to see if anything jumps out
at me.  Other than "@function" and "%function" (synonyms?), and not
being in an .init or .fini section, I really don't see a difference.  I
haven't figured out why the cross compiler works but the native compiler
doesn't, either.  I may wind up sticking printf() calls into gcc to
try to track down what the heck's going on.  Probably not today, though.</p>

<p>Mark's installing Ubuntu and Fedora images on securitybreach (the
8-way server).  I asked him to poke at kvm, but apparently you have to
enable whatever cpu extensions it needs in the BIOS.  I have no IDEA how
that is supposed to make sense.</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>Why does Ubuntu keep spinning up my cd-rom drive?  Yes, I have Weird
Al's "Straight Outta Lynwood" in there.  I've had it in there for weeks.
But I'm not playing it, I ripped the tracks I want off of it ("Do I Creep You
Out" is inspired), and the case is in Austin so I can't exactly put it away
at the moment.</p>

<p>There's probably some random hal/dbus thing that's going "you have multiple
scsi drives, I can't tell them apart, let me scan all of them to see where
your swap partition is" or something crazy like that.  It spins it up
about hourly, it hums away to itself for  aminute or so, and then it spins
back down.  This is annoying, but it's about 15th down the list of
annoying things in Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I removed Pulseaudio from Cathy's machine for her yesterday, because
she was having the random sound failure problem I was.  Earlier today Eric
hit "underscores in the text screwing up the diff" which turned out to be
Ubuntu once again converting the second space of two consecutive spaces
into a some kind of unicode excape (hex 0xc2a0).  I think it happens when I
cut and paste text between windows (yes, even into vi).  I wrote
<a href=/clean.py>a little program</a> to remove them from things, I just
didn't run in this time because I hadn't noticed.  Yes I'm aware it shouldn't
do that.  It shouldn't default to an insane $LANG value (en_US.UTF-8) that
makes the "sort" command case sensitive either.  (The workaround is
"export LANG=C".  I told Eric to type "set" to see that value and he was
surprised at the 4500+ lines of crud that scrolled by.  It's ubuntu, it's
insanely bloated with stuff that's serves no obvious purpose except to
complicate the system and randomly break.</p>

<p>When I first told him most of the developers I knew responded to Ubuntu
8.10 by looking for another distro, he didn't understand why.  It's not
a very good development environment, and it's getting _worse_ with each
new release.  Pointing /bin/sh at dash and vimrc.tiny were just the tip of
the iceberg.</p>

<p>Nontechnical end users switching off of Windows do not get Linux
machines.  <a href=http://waiterrant.net/?p=680#comments>They get Macs.</a>
The main objection to Apple taking over the PC space is you have
to buy their hardware, but when
<a href=http://valhenson.livejournal.com/21031.html>full-time senior Linux kernel hackers</a>
buy Mac hardware as their primary systems, that's a hard argument to
really get behind.  (Mark's current system is a mac laptop, he runs Linux
under vmware.)</p></p>

<p>Got a draft of the C++ paper to Eric, relaxing a bit now.  (Still not
fully recovered from a month of Pollen.)  Playing lots of
<a href=http://armorgames.com/play/1716/gemcraft>gemcraft</a>, poking
at various things.</p>

<p>One of those things in the sh4 target for FWL, which doesn't natively
compile "hello world" because it can't find _init and _fini.  These symbols
live in crti.o, which is there and being linked in according to gcc -v,
but when I objdump -d the file it has ".init" and ".fini", where the i686
equivalent has "_init" and "_fini".  Hmmm...</p>

<p>Poking at uClibc/libc/sysdeps/linux/sh/crti.S it has ".hidden _init"
and ".hidden _fini" lines that look suspicious.  I don't know sh4 assembly
(and to be honest I'm still a bit fuzzy on the funky gnu assembly syntax
that's vaguely AT&amp;T based instead of what Intel uses (that's been
on my todo list longer than learning Lua), but if I remove those two
lines... no difference.  Sigh.  Ok, ask the list.</p>

<p>Speaking of Lua, Eric bumped into this over on the wesnoth project, after
the attempt to <a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/314826/>port chunks of it
to Python</a> died because its proponent managed to piss even Eric off.
(Are all Russian programmers crazy?  I note that Denys Vlasenko was very
insistent that he's Ukranian, not Russian.)  Anyway, somebody else showed up
proposing to port it to Lua instead, which is cool.</p>

<p>Lua is an interesting little language.  It's sort of like an anorexic
version of Python: it's a similar sort of scripting language but incredibly
minimalistic.  The interpreter is tiny, the programs compile down to tiny
bytecode, and the whole thing's basically a fairly thin wrapper around
chunks of C code.  I first encountered it in tomsrtbt (the floppy distro
that first introduced me to BusyBox almost a decade ago now), because half
of the commands in later versions of tomsrtbt were implemented in Lua, and
the whole distro was a 1.7 meg floppy image.  Seemed cool, learning it
went on my todo list.  Unfortunately, the
<a href=http://www.lua.org/docs.html>documentation</a> didn't have a quickstart
last I checked.  (You could read the reference manual, which I vaguely
recall was a PDF of a book.  I see they now have more than one book
you can read, but nothing like a quickstart or introduction to the
language.  On the bright side, more of the website's in english than when
last I checked.  The language is from Brazil.)</p>

<p>Looked for a Lua book at the bookstore at lunch, but they didn't have one.
Bought the <a href=http://waiterrant.net>Waiter Rant</a> book instead.</p>

<p>Eric was unaware of <a href=http://www.unix.org/whitepapers/64bit.html>the

<p>Yay, Christian Michon and Jason Azze both sent me copies of my missing
December blog entries, which I've finally spliced together into something
that probably bears a passing resemblance to the original blog file.</p>

<p>I slept until 3 today.  (Eric had dental surgery this morning, and
collapsed to sleep off the anesthetic when he got back.  I'm still

Fade tells me she's sick too.  I am currently the _healthy_ one.  It's
a strange feeling.</p>

<p>Cathy got me another box of the Traitorous Joe's triple ginger cookies
dipped in chocolate (milk chocolate this time).  I have a box (I've eaten
about 1/3 of it already), and Fade has a box which Cathy plans to mail
to her as soon as she's feeling better.  (It's a small box, but makes up
for it in sheer caloric content, and of course deliciousness.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>I spent most of yesterday and a lot of today dealing with a backlog of
"things I had no brain for this past month".  I'm now mostly caught up,
I think.  I need to give Gentoo From Scratch more of a workout, but
running it paralyzes my laptop.</p>

<p>Linux is great at scheduling multiple CPU hogs,
but sucks at dealing with even one I/O bandwidth hog.  I've tried the
CFQ scheduler and I've tried deadline and they're just different _kinds_
of suck, the problem is the queues are too deep.  The disk has to do 3-5
seconds of work for my I/O to make it to the top, and if it's blocked on
page faults (because the disk cache evicted pages my executable wasn't
using because I hadn't moused over that Firefox tab and triggered its
cursor-freezing decision recently) then it generally faults in ONE page,
waits three seconds, faults in the next page, waits three seconds... This
can easily turn into 30 seconds of pain on a really unhappy system.</p>

<p>Now imagine the disk cache disk cache putting enough memory on processes
that they start seriously swapping.  (Because, let's say, genext2fs was
told to create a 1 gigabyte file and it's too stupid to make it sparse even
with -z.)  Once the system goes INTO swap crazy, with firefox and kmail
open, it's not coming back out.  I eventually gave up and hit
ctrl-alt-backspace to kill the whole desktop, and it took about 3 minutes
for everything to go away.  It was that bad.</p>

<p>I don't think I believe in Linux on the Desktop anymore.  Let Apple have
it, if we can't figure this out after 19 years of trying, we deserve to lose
here.  (I didn't feel this way before I was forced to switch to gnome,
if I switch to an XFCE system I might start to have hope again.  I really
miss Konqueror.  Even on a system that ISN'T loaded, Firefox regularly goes
out to lunch for 30 seconds at a time while it runs its garbage collector.
This is triggered by crazy things like scrolling the screen or mousing over
hotlinks.)</p>

<p>Anyway, in the long run I can redo the bottlenecks in GFS to make it
_not_ beat my laptop to death.  Right now we're just focusing on getting it
to work, though.  Polish comes later.  The real problem is that my laptop
maxes out at 2 gigs of ram (apparently I can't install more than that
without buying a new one), and my working set of open windows is rather
close to 2 gigs anyway.  Add in a 256 meg emulator instance and 4 distcc
nodes running gcc and it goes all pear shaped.  (It works fine if I just
let it run, but if I try to do _other_ things with the laptop during this,
the responsiveness sucketh mightily.</p>

<p>Banging on <a href=http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=532>the C++ paper now</a>.
(Ordinarily I don't read Eric's blog and Eric doesn't read my blog.  We
don't get along when we discuss politics, and his blog is mostly about
politics.  But there's a reference to the paper last time we were
working on it.  Most of what I've been doing is re-reading the old drafts
and trying to figure out where I was going next when we left off.)</p>

<p>Ironically, the google cache has notes-2006.html, notes-2007.html,
and the current one, but not 2008.  Archive.org last updated _any_ link to my
blog in February 2008.</p>

<p>Hanging out at Eric and Cathy's, sort of working on "Why C++ is not
my favorite programming language" but so far mostly just recovering from The
Great Pollen Apocalypse of 2009.  (Yay recovering.  I'm in favor of it.  Slept
most of yesterday after my plane got in, and then slept until almost noon
today.  Kind of needed it.)</p>

<p>Found a backup that goes to the end of November, that's something...</p>

<p>I need to write my own top command.  The normal one does NOT do what I
normally want to do.  The ability to sort processes by memory usage
is nice (although more control over the different _types_ of memory
usage would be nice).  But really, in addition to CPU usage I want to sort
by I/O wait.  If I have two processes bogging the hard drive (usually
because one is doing a "find . -name blah | xargs grep blah" or something
similar, and the other is a compile or some such that turns into a disk
bandwidth hog when disk cache grows to evict its working set and it goes all
swap crazy), then the rest of the system GRINDS TO A HALT.  And it's not
grinding to a halt due to CPU hogs, it's grinding to a halt because
Mozilla swaps just mousing over its tabs.  (My laptop can only hold 2 gigabytes
of ram, not _nearly_ enough for Firefox to successfully wallow in the mud
or whatever it is pigs do when failing to display web pages.)</p>

<p>So yeah, top should sort by iowait, it doesn't, need to write one.</p>

<p>My sister is getting a house, it seems.  (Well, I'm buying it and renting
it to her, but the principle's the same.)  The offer she asked me to make
got accepted, and there's much faxing expected in the near future.  It's odd
that an amount that wouldn't buy a one bedroom condo in Austin gets a 4
bedroom 2 bath house in New Ulm Minnesota.  I keep thinking of Austin as a
cheap place to live.  It's not, really.</p>

<p>Plane leaves at 8:10 am, so I'm staying up.</p>

<p>The Linux Symposium guys just emailed out their "Mid-Feb Reminder!"
It's kind of sad that I'm not going to OLS, CELF, or Penguicon this year.
I feel I should go to _something_, maybe in the second half of the year.</p>

<p>For <a href=http://embeddedlinuxconference.com/elc_2009/>CELF</a> I simply
missed the paper submission deadline (I was busy), and I've only gone to that
when I'm presenting.  Possibly I should look into submitting a paper to the
CELF Europe thing in November.  (This year's page isn't up yet but
<a href=http://embeddedlinuxconference.com/elc_europe08/index.html>here's
last year's</a>.)  Mark and Solar wanted to do something on Gentoo From
Scratch for this year's CELF, maybe one or more of them would be up for
the European one?</p>

<p>OLS has been slowly deteriorating for years, ever since the Kernel summit
peeled off and half the kernel guys stopped coming.  Not exactly their fault,
nor is the fact that they're moving out of Ottawa.  (The facility they've
held it in is being renovated this year, and there apparently isn't another one
in town big enough.)  I'm reminded of when Atlanta Linux Showcase moved out of
Atlanta.  (Anybody remember <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/19990508054815/http://www.linuxshowcase.org/>ALS</a>?  Anybody?  Beuler?)
Oh well, good luck to 'em.  But I'm not traveling to Canada for it this year.</p>

<p>And of course I'm not going to Penguicon this year, because Matt Arnold
finally became con chair, and <a href=notes-2007.html#17-04-2007>he's the
reason</a> I stopped trying to help organize the thing in the first place.</p>

<p>(Imagine somebody who invented the "director of communications" position so
he could be the face of Penguicon, taking over
<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20040730201826/http://penguicon.org/>the
website</a> (which was our main interface to the world our
<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20030601070419/penguicon.sourceforge.net/news.shtml>first year</a>,
and getting <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTSqnyt16j0>interviewed</a>
instead of the con chair.  Imagine this person organized opening and closing
ceremonies last year and gave himself more screen time in each than the con
chair got in both combined.  Imagine that this person has lost more than one
job due to his devotion to Penguicon, which was the first convention he ever
attended.  Now imagine how he reacts to somebody who can legitimately say
"actually, I co-founded Penguicon".  He doesn't just react that way to me,
of course, at last year's con he had a circle of his friends standing around
mocking Tracy.  She went off and got a nursing degree, and isn't currently
involved in the concom anymore either.)</p>

<p>I'm sure Penguicon will do fine this year, out of sheer momentum if nothing
else.  Elizabeth Bear's going back, Wil Wheaton's finally promised to show up,
and I'm not trying to stop anybody _else_ from going.  Fade's flying up to
attend it.  (I was pondering hanging out at Haven during that weekend, and need
to arrange for somebody else to throw a dead dog party there if I don't, but
if I set foot in the con hotel during Matt's year he'll get all territorial
and start behaving... strangely.  There has been rather a lot of
<a href="http://landley.livejournal.com/36024.html">unnecessary drama</a>
with Matt and Matt's friends over the years, mostly unremarked because airing
dirty laundry doesn't help.  But I know from experience he's not always
entirely rational where I'm concerned (just because I haven't made things
public doesn't mean I haven't got years of email archives).  Deep down I
suspect that anybody capable of drawing attention away from Mr. Penguicon
"Must Be Stopped", and that's not healthy in the long run, but it's not my
problem anymore either, and I could easily be over-analyzing something that's
merely a personality conflict.  I'm just sad it screws up my wedding
anniversary...)</p>

<p>So that's three events I attended last year (four if you count the HP
thing), and for unrelated reasons I'm not going to any of 'em this year.
(I'm still racking up more frequent flyer miles than ever, but that's
for work and visiting Eric and such.)</p>

<p>On the bright side, I finally heard back from the
<a href=http://www.armadillocon.org/membership.htm>Armadillocon</a> con chair
(I know her because she ran Linucon's art show), and she's putting me in touch
with the head of programming.  So that could be fun.  (Stu and I decided not
to try to launch a new con during the big Economic Meltdown thingy.  Mostly
because Mark wanted to launch Impact Linux instead, and I wouldn't want to
do a fresh con in Austin without Mark.)</p>

<p>The new version of distcc builds with -Werror.  You'd think they'd know
better; you can never predict what useless new errors gcc will decide to
random generate each new version.</p>

<p>And distcc's ./configure requires -disable-Werror (mixed case) where
binutils' ./configure required --disable-werror (all lower case).  That
I don't expect better from: autoconf is pure evil.</p>

<p>At the airport.  Associating with the "free public wifi" access point here
causes NetworkManager to hang the whole gnome desktop.  The mouse still moves,
but nothing I click on matters and the keyboard is totally locked.  Telling
the system to suspend starts to do so, but hangs waiting for the desktop
processes to quiesce.  And of course, hard powering off the system and
rebooting, it re-associates again immediately on login.  So ctrl-alt-F1,
login as root, killall NetworkManager (yup, mixed case) before it has a
chance to lock up the system.  (And then experiment to confirm that's
what was causing the problem, requiring another reboot or two...)</p>

<p>Year of the Linux desktop.  Nontechnical end users.  Oh yeah.  I think
we can just give up on that one at the 20 year anniversary of Linux, don't
you?  (Is this "the ipw3945 driver sucks", "NetworkManager sucks", or
"The Gnome Desktop Sucks"?  Answer: Yes, all of the above.)</p>

<p>Now I have no preloaded web pages to read on the flight.  Darn.  Not
quite awake enough to program (they have caffeine on the flight, but
not in the waiting area).  I had to leave my chain mail equipemtn at home
because the Security Theatre people are convinced I'm going to take over the
plane with a pair of flat nose jewler's pliers (I've lost 3 pairs the way
and my current set were a birthday present from Fade), but of course the
laptop, router, and dozens of feet of cable aren't a threat.  Right.  (Can't
garotte anybody Cat 5, after all...)</p>

<p>Yay podcasts.</p>

<p>And gnome's volume control insists there are no sound cards.  Totem is
currently playing sound, just quietly.  When I right click on it and "open
volume control" I get a window with a slider that does indeed turn up the
volume, but the icon still insists there's no sound card.</p>

<p>Dear Gnome: give up already, will you?</p>

<p>The new distcc version is detecting that the build $PATH has python
in it, and then failing because Python.h isn't in /usr/include.  Because
python-dev is packaged up seperately, and may not be installed.  Wheee.</p>

<p>So trim the $PATH.  If it can't find Python, it can't make stupid assumptions
about related packages.  (Well, it would be more of a stretch, anyway.)</p>

<p>One more day until I can get away from

the pollen</a>.  (I note that when I booked that flight, I hadn't identified
the pollen as the reason I was feeling horrible, but getting away from it
is a marvelous side effect.)</p>

<p>So the uClibc 0.9.30.1 rollup patch didn't apply with toybox patch because
svn isn't signaling that it wants to create a file (by having the old file
be /dev/null or dated the epoch), it's just trying to add hunks to a
currently nonexistent file.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this because
if you apply a patch at the wrong -p level you don't want to create a whole
parallel hierarchy of files containing random junk.</p>

<p>Deferring file opening to the first hunk requires shuffling around far
more code than I'm comfortable with, but we just haven't got enough information
to see if it's one of these broken svn patches until then.  (Ideally we'd read
_all_ the hunks and make sure there only _is_ one, but that queing up more
pending state in memory than I want to do.)</p>

<p>I've done the resuffling, but I screwed up the state machine and now it's
writing duplicate lines into the output.  Possibly I should have #defines
for all these TT.state values.</p>

<p>Hanging out at Wendy's, hopped up on cedar pollen and antihistamines,
but getting work done.</p>

<p>Antihistamine vs air filters isn't a good trade.  Hoping a pill would
compensate for leaving said air filters may not have been the greatest move,
but I'm getting pretty tired of the inside of my condo.  I did some work from
the bedroom with the door closed today, with Aubrey meowing pitifully right
outside the whole time.  (Her turn to prevent me from working, apparently.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Reviewed the pending patches for uClibc-0.9.30.1.  Two of them are
required to build with 2.6.28 kernel headers, two of them are long and
complicated patches that may not qualify as part of a "bugfix only" release,
and then rest are harmless.  (One of them is a comment typo fix.  I'm
not sure that's really dot release material either, but at least it's
harmless.)</p.

<p>Unfortunately, gluing all those patches together into an uberpatch gives
me something toybox patch won't apply but the gnu one will.  (Sigh.  TANGENTS!)
This is because svn sucks and produces bad patches that don't signal they're
creating a file.  Quoting the patch man page:</p>

<blockquote><p>
You  can create a file by sending out a diff that compares /dev/null or
an empty file dated the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) to the file you
want to create.  This only works if the file you want to create doesnât
exist already in the target directory.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, the gnu version accepts broken patches that _don't_ do this,
such as those produced by svn, so I have to as well.  It seems like I have to
hold off on opening the file until I've parsed the first hunk, so I can figure
out that I need to create a file if the first hunk has no context lines, and
the minus range is 0,0 (meaning the starting line in the old file is 0 and the
starting length of the old hunk is also 0).  Hmmm...</p>

<p>Mark poked me about <a href=http://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort>arm-eabi</a>,
so I'm converting armv5l over.  Apprently the python guys didn't want to take
his arm-oabi fix patch because <a href=http://bugs.python.org/issue1762561>they
don't support oabi</a> anymore.  (Meaning Python no longer cares about armv4,
which is still shipping new hardware.  Oh well, maybe we can support it.)</p>

<p>Argh.  I really hate C++.  Guess how arm eabi decided to break?  During
the mini-native build of gcc-core/libstdc++-v3/libsupc++/eh_alloc.cc of
course:</p>

<p>So, I need two patches to qemu svn.  One makes sh4 -append work, and
the other makes cursor keys work in emulated systems.</p>

<p>The other thing I needed to do was remove the built-in command line
from the sh4 kernel; apparently it only looks for the one supplied by the
bootloader if it hasn't got one built in.  The sh4 kernel still isn't
finding its realtime clock (so it thinks it's Jan 1, 2000), but I'll worry
about that later.</p>

<p>The sh4 emulation is _really_slow_, I think there's large delays getting
inserted somewhere.  (Something I/O related, perhaps?  It boots up to
the "freeing init memory" bit pretty quickly, but then pauses there for 10
seconds before giving me a command prompt.)  Also, the sh4 native
compiler isn't linking anything corectly because it can't find _init or _fini
symbols.  Still: progress!</p>

<p>Saw Coraline again today.  Very well done movie, with lots of little
subtle things I hadn't noticed the first time, such as when The Other Boblinski
is falling apart he sounds obviously drunk (as he was accused of in the other
world by Coraline's real mother), or how when Wybie, the cat, and coraline
all turn their heads to one side near the end, I think the 3D stereoscopy turns
about 45 degrees to the side too in expectation that at least some members
of the audience will do the same thing.  (3D with polarized glasses only
works if your head is straight up and down.  Turn it sideways and it goes
all 2D again because the offsets are now vertical and your eyes just compensate
for that rather than perceiving it as depth.)</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by pollen after going out to movie/mall/Fry's.  We aired the
place out with the window fan while we were away (after a few days closed up
it gets a bit stuffy in here), but it's taken the filters a few hours to catch
up after we closed everything up and turned the central air back on.</p>

<p>Food gets a bit boring after a few days of being totally unable to taste
anything.  Other than "salty", "sweet", and "bitter", the sense of taste is
mostly smell at point blank range, and my sense of smell has not had a chance

<p>Sigh.  I had a longish entry for both today and yesterday typed up, but
then Ubuntu 8.10 decided that my network card was going to spontaneously lose
connection to the wireless hub, and when I told it to reenable networking it
went "kernel panic".  And of course the .swp files vi makes stopped working
back around... oh, 7.10 was it?  (Back about when you started having to "ln
-sf vimrc /etc/vim/vimrc.tiny" each new install to pull vi out of its
artifically braindead mode they put it into to punish us for not using Emacs.
Dude, it's 2009, vi has supported the cursor keys in insert mode for 20 years
now.  I'm aware that historical versions PREDATE THE INVENTION OF CURSOR KEYS,
but that's really not relevant anymore, is it?)</p>

<p>So yeah, Ubuntu's getting sad enough I may have to switch my laptop to
Gentoo or something.  Ubuntu is focusing on being an accurate Windows
replacement to the exclusion of being a feasible development environment.
I can't switch to Fedora, that's just Red Hat Enterprise Rawhide and not a
real distribution in its own right.  (They should rename it "Pointy Hair
Linux" and be done with it.)  Not SuSE, that's a Fedora Wannabee and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Microsoft.  What else does that leave?  Debian
<a href="notes-2005.html#09-07-2005">lost me forever</a> back in 1998.
Slackware never scaled beyond one guy.  Knoppix never grew past a live CD,

<p>What have I been doing.  Went to the mall yesterday and worked from the
food court again.  Bought some very expensive air filters for the air
conditioner on the way home, and they _worked_, and I can BREATHE again,
and I actually got SLEEP last night, and I slept until 3 pm because I needed
it.  Met Mark for dinner at Fuddruckers and we updated our todo lists.
There was more.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Banging on sh4 a lot, because it _almost_ works in qemu svn.  Finishing
useradd.  Reveling in being able to breathe again as long as I don't go
outside.  Catching up on work.</p>

<p>Strangely, Miso Soup seems to have a significant medicinal effect, but
it only lasts so long...</p>

<p>Later, out at lunch at the highland mall, I've noticed that I have no
sense of smell.  None at all.  I got a little "snack sandwich" which is covered
in garlic, and seasoned breaded potato wedges, and I can't taste either one
and they smell like nothing.  Even my diet Dr. Pepper barely registers.  I
could taste the sushi and miso soup at breakfast, but now: nada.  (I'm afraid
to drink the bottle of tea in the side pocket of my backpack.  I _think_ it's
the fresh one I had with me in the car rather than one left over from
yesterday, but I right now I really can't tell.  Tap water normally has more
taste than this.)</p>

<p>I never used to have to worry about the gender of trees.  I feel like
arranging for one of those "Y: The last man" things to occur to Texas' Cedar
population, but am not quite sure how to go about it yet.  More planning is
required, and the acquisition of some serious herbicides, and possibly
expolsives.  (Living a block downwind of Pease Park isn't helping here, but
I'm out at the mall now, in air conditioning.  Something like recovery
should occur eventually, you'd think.  I'm no longer coughing and sneezing
as much, but I think my nose is in shock.)</p>

<p>Ha.  The sandwich was able to make its presence known anyway.  (Licking
largeish lumps of garlic off one's fingers afterwards is a bit of a giveaway;
I AM GARLIC.  BOW BEFORE ME, CEDAR!  Sandwich wasn't a total waste, then.)</p>

Shin-ichiro Kawasaki put up.  It almost works for me.  Trying his way to
boot it before fiddling with mine, I had to make a couple minor tweaks to
his qemu command line (the kernel name he packaged and the one his README
said were different), but I eventually got a login prompt (in what looks like
a vga window).  Alas it refused to load the USB keyboard his command line
specified, so I couldn't actually type anything.  Rebuilding qemu with current
snapshot to see if that helps.  I forgot how long qemu takes to build (even
with -j 3)...  Nope, still can't add the USB keyboard.  Hmmm...</p>

<p>Ah, that's a known problem mentioned in the original post to the list.
(Duh.)  No, the problem I _should_ be worried about is that the serial console
isn't working.  (Which would neatly bypass the need for a USB keybaord, but
alas, doesn't if it won't work.)  And the scripts/extract-ikconfig thing
from the linux kernel source isn't finding a config.gz in this zImage, despite
the README saying it should, so I can't get the .config out to start playing
around with that way, either.</p>

<p>Darn.  Tantalizingly close to working.  Oh well, poke the list and
move on until I get email back.</p>

<p>I note there's a working sparc test image up, except that uses glibc and
my problem has been getting uClibc to work.  (It would be nice to compare
the kernel .config too, but proc has no config.gz in that image.)</p>

<p>Mark who once said "Beware the Tokamak, my son" when captioning
photos of things he bumped into around UT.  It's a type of reactor that
uses a magnetic bottle to contain plasma hot enough to eat through any physical
material we've currently got.  That by itself is sufficiently "star trek"
to be cool.  Upgrading a fission reactor into a fission/fusion hybrid reactor
that uses fusion to break down the nuclear waste the fission produces, and
basically sends the materials back and forth between the two until they stop
being radioactive (getting energy out of each stage) is even cooler, and
something I'll believe actually works when I see more widespread deployment.</p>

<p>But naming the invention that allows the hybridization to happen the
<a href=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/01/27/nuclear_hybrid/?AddInterest=1284>Super X Divertor</a> is just grandstanding.  (They could have at least used
an established name, like Interoceter, Oscillation Overthruster, Flux
Capacitor, Heisenberg Compensator...)  That sounds like a badly translated
Japanese name, and is bound to attract Gamera or Godzilla or maybe Team

<p>Ok, there is deep and abiding suckage in attempting to cross compile
libstdc++.</p>

<p>So the ./configure stage for libsupc++ builds on the ./configure stage for
C, but it needs something _else_ to be cross compile aware.  What, exactly,
that something is, remains an open question, but animal sacrifice is near
the top of the short list.</p>

<p>It tries to grab xgcc (which is a host compiler) as both the C and the C++
compiler to build libsupc++ with.  This A) doesn't work at a theoretical
level, B) explicitly specifies insane paths, and dies later in ./configure
unable to build, well, _anything_.</p>

<p>I can use config.cache to manually feed it the target C compiler, but if I
do that configure dies because first it figures out it's not using a native
compiler, then disables certain tests, next it throws some highly verbose
warnings about it, and finally sits down in the mud and throws a tantrum when
it wants to run one of those tests and can't.  (Specifically it tries to figure
out if libm contains some symbol or other, which is a target libc thing that
gcc didn't need and which hasn't been _built_ yet when we build gcc because
you need a target gcc to build it.)</p>

<p>If I leave the C compiler alone and instead feed config.cache $ARCH-g++ as
its c++ compiler, it happily builds stuff with it (assuming I move everything
down after uClibc++ is built and installed, because yes it's trying to use
the libc header files, even though I'm _just_ building libsupc++ and
not the full libstdc++), and then it links the result with the C compiler
(which is still a host compiler and is at _best_ producing the wrong elf
signatures).</p>

<p>Ignoring both of these issues for the moment, the build can make it as
far as the uClibc++ build... where it dies because it hasn't got libgcc_eh.a.
Because the cross compiler was built --disable-shared (and thus that stuff is
in libgcc.a), and if we _hadn't_ done that there would be a fun chicken and
egg problem with the libc.so.6 reference that libgcc_s.so leaks.</p>

<p>I could play whack-a-mole with this for another week, nailing every stray
idiocy in place, but it would be simpler to just build gcc a second time with
a completely different configuration, which is essentially what I'm doing
during mini-native.sh already, which is why building uClibc++ after _that_
stage works.  As much as I hate the enormous layering violation of having
mini-native.sh install files into the cross compiler, the _simple_ alternative
is to cut and paste that entire build into the cross compiler, and it's a toss
up which is uglier.</p>

<p>So large amounts of ugly fiddly code duplicated in two places, vs important
functions being done at the wrong time from the wrong place.  (There are times
when I REALLY hate C++.)  As always, when faced with a choice between two
hideously unpalatable options, the answer probably involves beat a third option
out of the situation with a bazooka and some duct tape.</p>

<p>Ok, here's the least disgusting alternative I can come up with: make a
tarball of the uClibc++ files out of mini-native and copy 'em into the
cross-compiler from another script entirely.  It's ugly, but it avoids both
duplication of the build logic and having mini-native.sh modify its cross
compiler.  (It's ugly however you look at it, but that's the _least_ ugly
option I can come up with.)  And it means that creating a static cross compiler
after the fact doesn't require building mini-native again, so it doesn't impose
quite as horrible sequencing issues.</p>

<p>I think all I actually have to do is "cp $TOOLS/lib/lib*c++* $CROSS/lib"...
Except that won't work because according to ldd, libuClibc++-0.2.2.so wants
libgcc_s.so.1.</p>

<p>Nuts to your white mice.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, when I order a Hot Chocolate at Starbucks, when the ask me the

with both hands.  Every time I do this, they give me whatever the 20 ounce is
called ("Vingt").  This time I just said I wanted a large, and they gave me the
smallest one ("Alegretto").</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Ok, three obvious choices for uClibc++:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build uClibc++ with -lgcc.a -lgcc_eh.a instead of -lgcc_s.so (possibly
modifying the build wrapper).</li>
<li>Build the sucker twice, once against the static libgcc and once against
the dynamic.</li>
<li>Copy the dynamic libgcc into the cross compiler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once again, all the choices suck but I've already got my third option if
I can just figure out which one it _is_...</p>

<p>I'd look at an option 4 (just copy libuClibc++.a into the cross compiler and
force static linking) except that libuClibc++.a is 685k and the shared version
is 159k.  (Why is that?  Ah, if I strip it the result is 255k, which makes more
sense.  Although it still looks like libgcc.a is getting sucked in, which you'd
think the things building _against_ it would already do?  Send email to Garrett
asking what's up, and move on...)</p>

<p>Ok, if I retroactively copy the -lgcc* files over, and the rebuild the
wrapper with -DGIMME_AN_S, is there anything else in the toolchain that's
going to care?  (I don't think so...)  So I think I can retrofit a
--disable-shared toolchain to be --enable-shared fairly cheaply, meaning
the third option in the above list seems least disgusting.</p>

<p>Thunderstorm tonight, impressive one.  Tore off the awning on the pizza
place across the street from Starbucks (well, rotated it 90 degrees and
punched a hole in it, anyway), and upended lots of chairs and tables on
Starbucks' patio.  Looked distinctly tornado-y for a bit, but decided
it wanted to upend a medium sized lake on the city instead, and had a schedule
to keep.  On the bright side, the pollen is already noticeably reduced.

<p>Ok, what's involved in doing read-only hda mounts?  I want to build
static cross compilers, for all targets, in parallel.  Meaning I want to fire
up lots of instances of qemu and run them in parallel to take advantage of
SMP.  I'd like to have them share the same root filesystem image, meaning it
should be a read only disk (or perhaps an initramfs).  Ideally I'd like to
decompress all the source into that as well, meaning setupfor needs to use
symlinks instead of hard links.</p>

<p>So, modification to setupfor to add a SNAPSHOT_SYMLINK config option,
modification to run-emulator.sh to add a read only option (technically
--no-rw), and then a new wrapper script to create an image with all the
source.  Should the new wrapper run qemu read/write, extract the source,
and then exit, or should it extract the source outside the emulator and run
system-image.sh again to repackage?  (It can be made to work either way...)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Bugs in things I thought were done.  The uClibc++ build during the cross
compiler is dying because the ./configure part of the libstdc++ build (part
of the gcc build) breaks.  Once again, autoconf is horribly brittle and doing
stupid things, and doing them _differently_ in contexts that have no obvious
reason to be different.  (Butterfly effects.)</p>

<p>It's too bad there's no a more automatic way to set environment variables.
I tried "THING_{ONE,TWO,THREE}=42 set" and it told me "THING_ONE=42: command
not found".  Alas.  (Yeah, I find corner cases.)</p>

<p>Three hours later, still fiddling with libstdc++.  I could just cut and
paste the relevant chunks of the native gcc build to the end of the
cross-compiler.sh stage, but duplicating such a large, complex, and _ugly_
chunk of the script is kind of painful.  (The gcc ./configure invocation in
mini-native.sh is _nine_lines_long_, and is basically the result of me hitting
./configure over the head with a wrench until it stops moving.  Not that the
six line version in cross-compiler.sh is much of an improvement, but having
_two_ of them in cross-compiler.sh would suck.)</p>

<p>I could teach mini-native.sh to install uClibc++ in two places (retrofitting
it into the cross compiler), but that's an ugly tricksy layering violation that
does something non-obvious and is just horrible.  I tried moving the entire
uClibc++ block (including the libstdc++ build) after the uClibc build (the
error is about being unable to build binaries, the compiler ./configure is
calling can't find headers and it can't find libraries to link against),
but that didn't help.</p>

<p>One problem is that I can't just cd into the subdirectory and run
./configure in there.  I have to call it through the makefile and the best
granularity I can get is "make configure-target-libstdc++-v3", and the makefile
isn't passing on environment variables so I can't override things the way
I'm doing for the other ./configure phases.</p>

<p>This means it's inheriting a lot of the config
settings from the gcc build, which makes sense on one level because things like
sjlj-exceptions have to match up with what the compiler's doing.  (This is a
flaw in the C++ language: it's full of non-obvious magic and fiddly sharp edges
that have to match up in the ABI du jour.  This is the fundamental problem
that makes it hard to build a separate C++ library the way you can with a C
library because the ABI isn't simple or well-defined.  Of course the g++
guys have made zero effort to work around this problem, and happily glued
it together into even more of a big hairball.)</p>

<p>But this also means that the second ./configure invocation is using
the temporary compiler (xgcc) that the gcc build hacked together, which can't
link anything because it can't find a C library or headers.  Which might
almost make sense if that was a _target_ compiler, because when gcc is
initially built, uClibc hasn't been built yet because you need a cross
compiler to build it.  (There's a fundamental sequencing issue here, and I
really don't want to build stuff twice.)</p>

<p>But xgcc is a _host_ compiler.  (Of course before I worked this out, I
tried moving the entire uClibc++ block (including the libstdc++ build) after
the uClibc build, which didn't help.)</p>

<p>Once again, the "config.cache" mechanism allows us to manually answer the
questions ./configure is asking.  In this case, the questions are "what's
our c compiler" and "what's our c++ compiler".  I'm not quite sure if this
is the host compiler or the target compiler it wants.  (I think xgcc is a host
compiler, but what does it need that _for_?)  Feed it "gcc" and "g++", and...
it's ignoring the existing values and overwriting them.</p>

<p>I really, really, really hate autoconf.</p></p>

<p>That's right, those crazy (read "insane") kernel developers shattered the
sound module into 15 separate pieces.  No idea which one of them is broken,
and no obvious way to cycle this subsystem short of rebooting.  (And that's
separate from the hal/dbus/udev crap layered on top.)</p>

<p>Ubuntu becomes more like Windows every day.  It's sad.  Eric and I wrote
about this <a href=http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch04s01.html>years

not very useful to have it _be_ on its own?</p>

<p>Specifying WRAPPER_TOPDIR=/blah in mini-native when the native compiler is
_also_ using the wrapper _does_not_work_.  You wind up with uClibc++ (first
build after that) trying to link a host binary against the target crtbegin.o.
Yes, this broke FWL's ability to rebuild under itself, and it turns out to
be tricky to fix.  I have two different instances of the wrapper and I
want different behavior out of them.  I think I need to add the architecture
to the variable names, WRAPPER_TOPDIR_armv4l=/blah.</p>

<p>Ok, Mark pointed out that mke2fs isn't in the $PATH when run-emulator.sh
tries to call it on a gentoo host, which I'd <a href=notes-2008.html#12-11-2008>bumped into</a>
before, but had forgotten about.  Not quite sure how to properly fix it.
Gentoo doesn't put /sbin:/usr/sbin in the $PATH for non-root users, which is
sort of the point of having those be separate from /bin:/usr/bin in the first
place, but means that lots of stuff normal users can call (ifconfig is another
one I've missed) isn't available unless you call it by absolute path.</p>

<p>I vaguely recall that Red Hat used to do this years and years ago, but
Red Hat abandoned the desktop market so long ago the details are a bit fuzzy.
(Fedora is Red Hat Enterprise Rawhide and nothing more.  Deal with it.)</p>

<p>Adding a symlink to build/host is not a proper fix, nor is calling the
tool at an absolute $PATH.  I guess I need to put a test in run-emulator.sh
and add /sbin:/usr/sbin to the $PATH if it can't find mke2fs.  (That's a
fairly specific fix rather than a generic one, but for the moment I'm only
encountering a specific problem.  I can always genericize it later.)</p>

<p>Ok, so if "groupmod -g" changes the gid of a group, what happens to users
who have that as a default group?  Do their user entries get updated?  The
man page implies no, but testing the command says yes.</p>

<p>Note to self: when debugging new user fiddling utility implementations,
accidentally running "rm /etc/passwd" as root: bad thing.  However, if you
find yourself having just done this, remembering that you have a terminal you
just did a "cat /etc/passwd" in and that you can cut and paste from: good.
(Not panicing, also good.)</p>

<p>Merging Mark's distcc fixes.  (I broke it in at least two places since
the last time I properly tested it.)  Now I'm running a build with distcc
enabled, and the binutils build is dying.  The reason binutils is dying is
that the host-tools.sh step sets $PATH to point to just the build/host
directory (filtering everything out), and distcc looks for the second
occurrence of the name it's called as (such as gcc) to find the local version
of each utility.  And host-tools doesn't _leave_ a second occurrence in
the $PATH.  (Kind of the point of it.)</p>

<p>Yeah, that's not going to work: what host-tools.sh is trying to do (filter
the environment, simplify it, remove anything non-obvious) is incompatible
with distcc at the _design_ level.  Right.  So I can add explicit support for
distcc to host-tools.sh, or I can just skip the host-tools stage when building
under distcc.  (For right now, just skip it.)</p>

devices it sees, just "discovery session activated".  Great, that's
COMPLETELY USELESS.  Tried disabling and re-enabling bluetooth in my phone:
nope.  Unplug/replug the bluetooth key (and relaunch the daemon): nope.</p>

be mined for some of it?  I should ping solar.</p>
</span>

<p>Met with bank people about mortgageness.  The _taxes_ on a new place as
big as Fade and I were looking at would be around $675/month, plus another
$100/month for insurance, and then the mortgage on top of that.  This is not
counting repairs and general upkeep to the place (currently covered by
the condo association fee).  That's... disturbing.  I think holding off on
getting a new house is called for.</p>

<p>I also got an approval letter so I can buy my sister a place.  The downside
there is that the _smallest_ mortgage my credit union will do is $50k and
they want me to put 20% down, so they can't give me a mortgage for a place
as _cheap_ as the ones Kris has been looking at.  (There are apparently some
very nice places in rural minnesota going for under $60k.)  And no, you
can't get a mortgage for more than the place is worth and use the rest for
repairs.  I asked.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of the part in The Art of Unix
Programming where Eric talked about "Bernstein Chaining", which I pointed
out during my editing pass was a horrible name for something that guy
didn't invent.  The technique Eric was pointing out was running the rest
of your command line via the fun little trick of
exec(argv[offset], argv+offset), the way "nice", "nohup", "detach", "setsid",
and so on have been doing for decades.  After I pointed out a few preexisting
counterexamples, he decided it the name only applied to using it for security
purposes... the way "su", "sg", and "chroot", do?  And this isn't counting
tools like ssh that wash a command line through a shell.  (Did Bernstein do
sudo, and if not does it also predate his stuff?)</p>

<p>Catching up on my podcasts, according to Russell Tice the NSA was recording
every domestic communication for the past several years.  No warrants, no
disclosure, no oversight, no limits.  Gee, what a surprise.  (We didn't
prosecute J. Edgar Hoover for doing that, so what's their downside?)</p>

<p>Mark's been amused that for years now I've said "hello office of domestic
surveilance" into my cell phone when I think I've just said something that
triggers an automated word searche that might flag an actual agent to listen
to fifteen seconds of the recording.  (Yeah I throw a little chaff into the
radar.  Force of habit.  As Cory Doctrow pointed out, the best defense against
universal surveilance is flooding it with noise so it's useless in practical
terms.  All those "automated filter and search" things are about as useful
as net-nanny software.  It's an AI-complete problem to do it right.)</p>

<p>What annoys _me_ is that my new phone has the "it can be remotely
switched on to listen in speakerphone mode when it seems like it's off"
feature all the new ones have, and when they do that it drains the darn
battery.  I can't _prove_ that random sampling of the population is the reason
this phone usually has a couple _weeks_ of standby time, but sometimes it
inexplicably goes from three bars to dead in an afternoon when I'm not using
it, and not at the edge of signal range so that it would be searching.  (Not
only was this capability documented years ago, but there was a BATMAN movie
using it as a plot point.)  Privacy issues aside, nerfing my battery life
should require a warrant.</p>

<p>Again, my biggest disappointment about Obama: voting for FISA during the
primaries.  My father works for the defense industry and has a reasonably
impressive security clearance, my grandfather worked for the NSA for many
years because he got into cryptography during World War II and couldn't
get back _OUT_.  (They threatened to draft him for the Korean war if he didn't
voluntarily sign back up, and he was stuck there until retirement age.  He
still won't tell me what happened to him in Iraq in 1982, just that he's
deeply pissed about it because he was NOT a field agent and should not have
been used as one.)  I stay way the heck away from all that stuff for a
_reason_...</p>

<p>Lest I come off as a paranoid tinfoil hat type, I point out that an
undirected federal bureaucracy remains largely ineffective no matter how much
information it has.  The feds already have your tax records, bank records,
they _issued_ your social security number, they run the post office, and
so on.  Yeah, the pack-rats want ever more, but mostly they just shove it in
big boxes and never look at it again.  Just having it is the important
thing.</p>

<p>Most of us just aren't very _interesting_, but boy are we
chatty.  The current lot of surveilance monkeys have a ways to go to be nearly
as proactive as the documented activities of J. Edgar Hoover, let alone some
of the cold war excesses.  Collecting information and being able to do anything
useful with it are two completely different things.  Data mining turns out to
be subject to Sturgeon's Law in spades (great way to find false correlations
and random coincidences) and beyond that it information overload just sifting
through the publicly available stuff.  (I pity anybody assigned to sort through
the contents of my hard drive.  I sometimes have trouble with that, and I'm
the one who filled it up in the first place.  I'd spring clean, but they keep
selling bigger ones...  I'm far more worried about the Nigerian spammers
and Russian organized crime guys trying to get my credit card information
or zombie one of my boxes than I am about intelligence agency du jour.
Who's more likely to figure out what they've got and act on it within my
lifetime?)</p>

<p>Last I paid real attention to this (years ago)
the spy agencies were most interested in tracking other spy agencies (China,
Israel, the FBI and CIA spying on each other, etc), and the people most likely
to effectively pay attention to civilians were the corporate espionage types
(who accomplished more with less than any of the government-backed ones).
Yeah, 9/11 made the US spies broaden their horizons (which is another way of
saying "lose focus"), but data hoarding is not the same as extracting useful
timely intelligence.</p>

<p>Their stockpiles might be of interest to historians if the information
survives and gets declassified in 50 years, though.  We _know_ Hoover
had Einstein's phone tapped, but alas future generations didn't get to
hear the tapes...</p>

<p>(Yes, this is what I think about when I have a cold and am too groggy
for decent technical work...)</p>

<p>Jean Wolter, who insists "I am not that interesting as a user for you"
because "I use [Firmware Linux] to get a chroot build environment for
x86", has repeatedly reported an outright design flaw in host-tools.sh
until I finally figured out how to fix it.  (I'm not sure users _get_ more
interesting than that.)</p>
</span>

<p>I'm outright proud of myself for avoiding the use of a gender-specific
pronoun in the above sentence.  The language is against me here.  At least
we don't assign gender to radios and boots and such.  (Ok, we have "mister
potato".)</p>

<p>It's too bad there isn't a reliable way to find good anthropology
classes.  I actually enjoy reading <a href=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/haidt08/haidt08_index.html>this</a>
sort of thing.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Looking at useradd default values, and how to override them.  (The actual
plumbing and security implications aren't bothering me so much.  Reproducing
the poorly thought out user interface, however: nontrivial.)  I guess the
reason for -g is that if you specify -g again it overrides what's already
there.  It seems like -U is the default (create a new group for each user),
then specifying -g would switch it off, and it does.  And if you specify
"-g 42 -U" it fails and spits out a usage message.  (Yes, group 42 exists,
it's "shadow".  No, I don't know why shadow has a group, it's pretty much
designed to be accessible root only.)  So why does -N exist?
(Specifying it without -g sets the gid to "100", which is a group called
"users" which isn't used by any existing user.)</p>

<p>Ok, how to cut back some of this complexity overgrowth...  Part of the
problem is that /etc/default/useradd is a default command line, later commands
need to be able to override it.  So if you specify -g in the default
command line, having another -g on the command line should override this,
and they way I set it up -g and -G are A) equivalent, B) append to the list
of groups this user is a member of.  Huh.</p>

<p>I've already got one config variable (USERADD_FIRST_UID) specifying the
first UID to auto-allocate.  I can make -N use that, and -g override them
both.  So you don't need -g in /etc/default, so I _could_ still have
it append, but I suspect I should only take the last -g (but multiple -G).</p>

<p>I can also make a config entry to enable support for -UN, and make it the
default if it's supported.  So you don't have to specify -U in the default
command line either (which is good if -g needs to override a default behavior
of -U but the old useradd bombs if -g and -U appear on the same command
line.)</p>

<p>Come to think of it, do you really need /etc/default?  If I'm already making
the mostinteresting options selectable at compile time...  Parsing a command
string into an argv[] isn't free, then appending the existing options to
it...  Hold off for now and see if it's really needed later.</p>

<p>Ha!  "useradd 42" was _not_ rejected.  I can create users whose names are
numbers, but not the corresponding uid.  While I admit I need to be root to be
able to do this, I can see a user named "0" confusing various portions of the
sysstem.  (It won't let me create a negative uid.)</p>

<p>Kirby lane for breakfast with Stu, looking at the suspicous grey stains
on my bread and wondering if it was moldy.  I ordered a portabello mushroom
sandwich: yes, it has fungus on it.  (Not awake yet.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Where I left off last night: /etc/default/useradd provides defaults.  The
logical thing to do is just let it have command line arguments that get parsed
before the ones provided on the command line.  (No point having the same data
in two formats.)</p>

<p>Where this gets tricky is that the command line options are parsed by
the toybox infrastructure before it gets to the useradd_main().  It's
easy to feed in new options _after_ parsing the command line ones, but
overriding defaults means going the other way.  My first impulse was to
add a flag to tell the common infrastructure not to parse the command line,
but I've already got a way to do that: it skips option parsing for the
command if the command's option string is NULL.  So feed in a NULL option
string, then manually call the option parsing logic with the real option
string from the useradd_main().</p>

<p>Wondering if I should bench various <a href=http://www.alphatek.info/2009/02/02/io-scheduler-and-ssd-part-2/>I/O schedulers</a>
for FWL native builds.  Under the emulator, processor time is expensive and
I/O sucks so both CFQ and NULL schedulers have distinct downsides.  (I've
been leaning towards NULL because the host has an I/O scheduler already, but
if it reduces the number of system calls the emulator makes... Hard to
tell.  Probably have to bench it.  Later.)</p>

<a name="01-02-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#01-02-2009">February 1, 2009</a></h2>
<p>I'm 37 today.  This is mildly disturbing.</p>

<p>Stressful weekend.  Not sure why.  It's not birthday stuff (I actually
forgot until last night), I'm just doing a bit of a red queen's race right
now with various technical projects.</p>

<p>Vaguely pondering a new laptop.  (Mine still works fine, but it doesn't have
the hardware extensions kvm wants, and maxes out at 2 gigs ram.)  Except
I'm reluctant to spend money on hardware just now because Mark spent over $5k
of our company's money on hardware this month: $2k reimbursing his own
laptop purchase and over $3k on a new server.  (I admit an 8-way 2.5 ghz 64
bit system with 32 gigs of ram is kind of cool.  Neither Stu nor myself could
talk him out of buying Dell, only experience will do that, but at least I
talked him out of getting SAS drives instead of SATA.  Too bad FIOS isn't
a viable option in Austin.)</p>

<p>The reason I'm pondering a new laptop is the existing Petalogix build
(the one we need to get FWL to create a new toolchain for) requires Red Hat
Enterprise (or its near-clone Centos).  Stu installed a copy to play around
with that build, and yesterday he gave me the Centos livecd image he'd used,
which I just booted under qemu.  It took about 10 minutes to get to the
desktop.  That's mostly because RHEL is a pig, but partly that unaccelerated
qemu is slow.  (And I've never had any luck with kqemu.)</p>

<p>Of course the Centos livecd hasn't got development tools on it, and it
won't actually _install_ without network access.  (See "pig".  A cdrom just
isn't enough space.  Right.)  Alas, Starbucks still has AT&amp;T brand
lack of internet access.  (Failing to provide internet since 1995!)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Back working on useradd.</p>

<p>It would be really nice if the usleep() man page mentioned how many
microseconds were in a second.  (I could look it up if I currently had
internet access, but again; Starbucks.)  I think it's a million?  (Makes
a quick a.out...  Yup, looks like.)</p>

<p>I'm fairly certain I can get away with "if (--len != '+') len-=5;" because
the if() has to act as a sequence point.  (I know that "len -= (len++);" won't
do what you expect because even though the order of operations is darn clear
from the _language_, it turns out the optimizer is free to reorganize things
insanely when you assign to a variable twice in the same statement, and len++
counts as assigning to it...</p>

<p>Evening, back online, catching up with email.  Booked a flight to go
visit Eric and Cathy up in PA (I leave on Feb 17 and return March 4), so
hopefully we can finish the C++ paper and a follow-up to the 64 bit
transition.  Finally set up my Southwest airlines frequent flyer thing
("Rapid Rewards") and fed it the last few trips I've taken (so much for
"Rapid").  Apparently I need 9 more to qualify for a free ticket...</p>

<p>Got email about tinycc (somebody on windows who can't get the sucker
to build under Cygwin, wondering if I could help; alas, not really my area).
Glanced at the tinycc mailing list archives to confirm that the CVS archive
<a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2008-12/msg00009.html>is
still twitching</a>.  Wandering off to let it decompose another few months.
(I deal with CVS when paid to do so.  Pretty much by definition "something I
do for fun" and "fiddling with CVS" are mutually exclusive.  Thus I leave
tinycc to rot until the CVS goes away, if only because the project itself
goes the way of DOS.  I tend to check back in
<a href=notes-2008.html#22-10-2008>every three months</a> for some reason,
although these days it's mostly due to external poking.  (I could just start
replying to the messages about it with "They get rid of CVS, I come back.
Until then #%*(&%# off."  But it seems impolite somehow...)</p>
</span>

<p>Broke down and ordered another $300 worth of "splenda quick pak" things
before they go away.  (They were discontinued a while ago, but splenda.com
<a href=http://www.splenda.com/page.jhtml?id=splenda/products/quick_pack.inc>still
has some in stock</a>, and they're less than half the price they used to go for
in the store.)  It's premeasured 1 cup packs, which is A) perfect for making a
gallon of tea, B) not bad for making a pumpkin pie either.  I've gone through
half the previous order I did, and I dread trying to make tea after I run out
(opening ~3 dozen individual splenda packets and dumping them in the tea is not
much fun, nor particularly accurate), so I just ordered a bunch.  (Let's see
a "pack" is 24 envelopes, a case is packs, and I just ordered 10 cases...
I think I just ordered 960 cup-equivalents worth of splenda.  Let's say
I use 2 per week (between tea and various baking uses), 52 weeks/year...
That ought to last us a while...  That's just under a decade.  I can live
with that.</p>

<p>Dragon got out.  (Came back a few minutes later.)  Kiggy knows where the

They were mocking The Matrix this time.</p>

<p>No real technical work accomplished today (other than the start of writing

<p>Vaguely pondering a new laptop.  (Mine still works fine, but it doesn't have

really care as long as it works, but $3200 on depreciating hardware makes
me wince.  At least I talked him out of getting SAS drives, and I admit

<span id=programming>
<p>Dear useradd: you're doing it wrong.</p>

<p>Ok, the whole useradd/adduser split is silly, but what's almost as
silly is useradd having both -g and -G.  The first takes a single group name,
the second takes a comma separated list of groups.  Why not just have the first
one take a comma separated list of groups, which can have a length of one
entry?  (Is it because comma might be in a group name?  Punctuation other than
underscore in a group is iffy at best, and -G already doesn't support it.
A colon would violate the file format notation entirely, unless there's an
escape sequence?  The "man 5 passwd" page doesn't mention one...)</p>

<p>Right, so toygox useradd -g should take a comma separated list of groups,
and -G should just be a synonym for it.  I once wrote code for the busybox
"mount" command to merge different comma separated lists, but it's probably
less effort to just write it again than dig it up and port that.  (Yes,
even though I wrote it.)  And while I'm at it, the easy thing to do might
be to break down the various comma separated lists into a llist of individual
entries.  (Yeah, not quite optimal for nommu systems, but it should mostly work
even there.  It's a short-lived applet, we're fragmenting memory a bit but
not pinning it.)</p>

<p>Hmmm...  Given that compilers are now doing all sorts of funky
inline-and-optimize tricks for C code across functions and even across files
in "build at once" mode, what would be involved in having a source version of
libc installed, and building against that to give the compiler more
information to work with?  (At least for statically linked programs?)</p>

<p>Obviously this would be useless until after "make" went away, because the
dependency information about where to find each function (and the functions
that one depends on) just isn't there at the moment, not when you break the
one big library into hundreds of individual source files.  You'd need
something more like ctags and a build system with a brain, which make
profoundly is not.</p>

<p>Still, it's an interesting thought.  Yet another tangent I haven't got
time to follow up on...</p>

<p>Chris Steel emailed me about mips:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<p>I see from your development log that you're trying to get qemu to
emulate a MIPS board with more than 256MB of memory. Not sure this is
ever going to work due to the way that MIPS memory works.</p>

<p>The 32 bit addresses use the top 3 bits to determine if you're in
kuserg (user space) kseg0 (uncached physical address) kseg1 (cached
physical address) or kseg2 (some kind of MMUed kernel space, but I've
never had to use that one). This limits the physical memory space to
512MB. Since most boards want part of this for mapped IO, they usually
limit physical memory to 256MB.</p>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>So fiddling around with alternatives to the malta board, not likely
to accomplish much.</p>

<p>If it is just _physical_ memory being limited, then I could put a 512 meg
file in /dev/shm, feed it in as -hdc to qemu, then mkswap /dev/hdc it use it
as swap space.  (Swapping to ramdisk isn't ideal, but it's something.)  On
the other hand, if the virtual memory address range is similarly limited...
I should ask him.</p>
</p>
</span>

<p>Made another stab at getting my cell phone internet to work, but I
can't even get Ubuntu 8.10's bluetooth to pair with the phone.  (The KDE
variant worked great.  The Gnome walkthrough wizard simply can't find it,
although it found some other device at Einstein's named "barbara".
(Mine's "Walrus".)  Fiddled with the menus and as far as I can tell the thing
should be announcing itself, but it isn't.  Maybe I should go to the T-mobile
store and make sad eyes at them?)</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>Oh, this is promising.  From dmesg:</p>

<p>Bravo, dbus, you unnecessary layer of infrastructure you.  I came up with
the idea of power cycling my phone after removing the bluetooth USB dongle,
but plugging the bluetooth dongle back in is now being completely ignored.
That would appear to be why.  Great.  A hotplug layer that can't handle device
removal.  That's just STELLAR.</p>

<p>(Eight hours later, the desktop inexplicably froze for 15 seconds, and when
it came back it had switched window manager themes.  I have no idea why.  This

<p>Ah, correction.  There's one busybox suit still in progress, the one
Olivier Hugot is doing in France, where Erik and I teamed up with
Harald Welte of gpl-violations.org and some other guys.  (Just got a status
update on that today.  The SFLC isn't directly involved in that one.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Last night I sent Mark a kconfig tarball so he can give Gentoo From
Scratch a pretty user interface, but that won't keep him occupied for long.
Poking at useradd to unblock him going forward (lots of packages portage can't
build without that).  Writing a message to the FWL mailing list about it though,
because it's confusing.</p>

<p>Got a bug report that the toybox 0.0.8 release has an x86-64 kconfig/config
binary in it.  Oops.  My release script does a "make defconfig" and doesn't
do a clean afterwards before tarring it up.  Um, right.  Fix release script,
cut a 0.0.9 release (which is just a repackaging of 0.0.8 without this
thinko.)</p>

<p>Cleaning up all the 2.6.28 miniconfigs.  i686, i586, and x86_64 were
fairly straightforward, and both arm variants already worked (I really
need to switch armv5 over to EABI, and v6 and v7 up too).  Sparc was also
using scsi so it's broken the same way it's been.  I still haven't got a
working qemu board for sh4 or m68k, and I need to fix powerpc or find an
alternate board.</p>

<p>But mips is being stroppy.  Mark send me a config that works, but it's based
on the malta defconfig so it's got lots of unnecessary stuff switched on.
The one I tried to put together didn't work, and I have yet to figure
out why.  Binary search comparing the two now, and...  I think it's
CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS.  I don't now _WHY_, but I'm going to stop fiddling with
it for the moment.</p>

<p>I should poke at qemu.  It would be nice if -kernel could always handle
an elf image (vmlinux), since the kernel always makes one no matter what your
target is.  (Other formats are generated from the vmlinux.)  It would also
be nice if it had an option to feed in a binary device tree (the bamboo board
now has the infrastructure, I should hook it up from the command line).
Finally, qemu needs infrastructure to _parse_ a device tree and set up a board
from it.  That one's decidedly nontrivial.</p>

<p>Ooh, Miklos Vajna sent me <a href=http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=frugalware-current.git;a=blob;f=source/base/kernel/config.ppc;hb=HEAD>a
powerpc config</a> that qemu can boot as a g3beige!  (The svn version of qemu,
now using actual openbios instead of open hackware, can -kernel boot a 2.6.28
vmlinux built from that.  As a power mac instead of a hacked up prep with
custom boot rom.)  That is deeply, deeply cool.</p>

<p>Argh.  Catching up on podcasts, the Jan 15th countdown contained Bush's

<p>Dear El Shrubbo: September 11th wasn't something you did.  It was something

Talking about receiving momentoes from survivors in your farewell address is
just pathetic; apparently the abject failure ever since wasn't your fault, it
was society's fault, it was the environment you grew up in...  Yeah.  Not
buying it.  Go away now.  ("Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology
is wrong, every time, every where."  Uh-huh, two words for ya sparky,
"collateral damage".  Or perhaps "civilian casualties".  Well into six
figures of 'em in Iraq, more in Afghanistan, although lots of those were
merely crippled for life rather than killed.  Still, the point is that your
black and white view of the world DOES NOT WORK.  Neither side consists of
holy infallible warriors, what you have to do is pick the best available
options and accept the consequences of your actions.  If you don't understand
that there _are_ downsides to just about every course of action in the real
world (let alone what they are and how to mitigate them) you aren't
qualified to handle any real power, period.  I know you're a recovering
alchoholic who switched your addiction to religion just like the 12 step
programs encourage, surrendering yourself to a higher power and all.  But
dude, you ain't God.  Deal with it.  You're not Superman ("fighting for

You might be "the Punisher", if such a job could be delegated from behind a

<p>I haven't made any secret that the Cisco thing cost the SFLC my

<span id=programming>
<p>Overwhelmed with todo items.  Trying to clear a few.</p>

<p>Mark says that Gentoo From Scratch is blocked on useradd, so when I asked
him about it he sent me an example of it failing to use getent.  Ok, looking at
getent: it's a GNU extension that's not in SUSv4.  Its description in its
man page is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The getent program gathers entries from the specified administrative
database using the specified search keys.  Where database is one of
passwd, group, hosts, services, protocols, or networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um... ew.  Ok.  Mostly it looks like they're running grep for "$2" against
/etc/"$1", and there's only six options for $1, so it's basically a smallish
shell script.  Test a few corner cases...  Done.</p>

<p>Poking at Linux network block devices.  Downloaded the userspace package
from nbd.sf.net, it's kind of sucky.  (They added autoconf to build two
executables, each of which is basically one source file.  It has a ./configure
stage for this spits out 107 lines of crap.  Why?)  This could theoretically
allow real hardware to run builds without attached storage, and qemu could
work the same way.  But in practice, real hardware can usually take a USB
drive: the real limiting factor for most of 'em is memory, you can't even
necessarily give them a swap partition because beyond a certain point the
page tables for it eat more physical ram and make the shortage worse.</p>

<p>At some point if I start to care, it looks like it wouldn't be too hard
to implement nbd-server and nbd-client in toybox.</p>

<p>The qemu mips emulation is also being stroppy.  The malta board maxes out at
256 megs, so I'm looking around for other
mips boards that might be able to hold more memory.  The "-M mipssim" option
of qemu looked promising, so I created a hw-mipssim target and melted down
the kernel's mipssim defconfig into a miniconfig, booted it... and it turns
out to be hardwired to 32 megs (in arch/mips/mipssim/sim_mem.c function
prom_getmdesc).  Which is sad, because qemu lets me feed in a megabyte and
I can specify "mem=1024M" on the kernel command line... it just ignores
it.  For that matter, specifying a command line at all involves modifying the
one hardwired into the kernel, because the one passed in by qemu's
"-kernel -append" combo isn't used.  Oh, it also hangs calibrating the delay
loop (init/calibrate.c function calibrate_delay, the "while (ticks==jiffies);"
line never advances).  I might be able to work around that by specifying
lpj=12345 on the command line, but have no idea what value to feed it...</p>

<p>Before heading to california I was in the middle of switching FWL over
to the 2.6.28 kernel as stable, and pieces are all over the floor as I'm
coming back to it a week later.  The config symbols for generic IDE hard
drive support changed (you now need CONFIG_IDE_GD and CONFIG_IDE_GD_ATA),
which broke every platform except arm (which is using SCSI, due to the board
being emulated).</p>

<p>I thought I'd come up with a new i686 target already, but didn't
replace the target's miniconfig.  Ok, fixed i686 and i586, I'll fix the
others in the morning.</p>

<p>Alas, the USB cable I grabbed was the "big usb to little usb" one used
by a lot of cameras and such.  This is not the cable my cell phone uses
to charge from my laptop; T-mobile did a proprietary special instead.  Sigh.
Cell phone battery just died after a phone call from Vito and Stephen,
asking why they can't get ahold of Mark.  (Answer: He's asleep.  I got to
bed at 5am after meeting him at Whataburger to go over a big digression
we're trying to get off our plates so we can get back to focusing on FWL
and GFS, and he came out of it with at least 4 largeish todo items he
planned to tackle before going to sleep.)</p>

<p>Met Fade for Lunch between classes (drove her to Zen), and now meeting
Stu for Coffee at the north Kirby Lane location.  I have my laptop, but
I'd _meant_ to have my cell phone working too.  Grrr...</p>

<p>Tonight I have to work at home because the next stage involves loading test
kernels into the 610n hardware until it confesses.  Can't exactly drag that
out with me, doesn't run on battery and too many cables anyway.  (But I found
my debug adapter!  Yay!  I was blocked on that for a while.  Now I just

<p>Reading my old messages to linux-kernel, trying to find the one where I
submitted broken-out patches with my changes against the stock linux Kconfig.
They didn't merge 'em, but I'm thinking of grabbing the toybox kconfig to
use in GFS, and first I should update it to the current kernel, and to do
_that_ I need to figure out what changes I made to the thing almost three
years ago.  (They're mostly the ones I put into busybox, so I could poke
at that source control too, but I've tweaked 'me a bit since.  Not much
since I broke them up nicely and sumitted them upstream to the kernel,
though.  Just re-applying that to current kernel kconfig would be the easiest
way to migrate.  If I can find where I submitted 'em, from a previous
laptop...)</p>

<p>So qemu svn 6419 explains why 256 megs has been our memory limit on qemu's
mips emulations:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
mips: limit RAM size to 256MB on malta and qemu boards

This avoid crash when a bigger RAM size is requested (the devices are
mapped at 0x01000000).

<p>That covers Malta and r4k.  The other three options are Magnum, Acer Pica
61, and MIPSsim.  Never heard of any of 'em, really.  Let's see what
the 2.6.28.2 kernel's arch/mips/configs directory has...  No mention
of pica or magnum, but there's a mipssim_defconfig.  (Which is somewhat
out of date, but I'll try squashing it to a miniconfig and throw it into
a hw-mipssim target and see what happens...</p>

<p>Today on Guadalupe, a big truck with the "Monster energy drink" logo on it
was handing out free caffeine.  (Yay!)  They gave me a... coffee flavored
energy drink.  (Um, give it to Fade, I guess?  Or Mark?)</p>

<a name="25-01-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#25-01-2009">January 25, 2009</a></h2>
<p>How do the cats get cat hair all over my keyboard when the lid is
closed?  I am _impressed_.</p>

<p>Walking down Guadalupe to The Donald's was an adventure today.  Einstein's
arcade closed a year or so back, and the place has been abandoned ever
since.  After a few months it got grafittid, shortly after which it developed
a sign in the front window saying "leased".  Last fall a banner went
up top saying some yogurt shop was planning to move in, but no actual yogurt
shop has yet  materialized.  Today I noticed that one of the bottom window
panes was smashed in, with broken glass behind it.  This apparently isn't
recent because a piece of plywood got put over it, and then dislodged
again by whichever homeless person broke in to sleep there in the first
place, presumably due to the cold.</p>

<p>A couple blocks later, I stopped to chat with the nice old homeless lady
(too many adjectives, I know) who sells flowers on guadalupe next to what
used to be the other arcade (Le Fun) before the Cult of Scientology raised
their rent too much.  (They own the whole building, and offer "free IQ tests".
If you take them up on it, you flunked.)  I can never remember if her name is
Rachel or Rebecca, I should just ask again but I've done so at least three
times already.  (The mnemonic for one is the junior phoenix from X-men and the
mnemonic for the other is the given name of "Newt" from Aliens, but that
doesn't help me remember which one applies here.)  For once I was carrying
cash, so I bought three dollars worth of flowers.</p>

<p>A minute later (while probably Rebecca and I were still talking), a man
came up trying to panhandle from both of us.  His story is that he was
relocated to Austin by Katrina and then abandoned by FEMA, and he has a wife
and three kids living in an abandoned/condemned apartment building scheduled
to be demolished soon.  Rebecca more gracefully extracted herself from
the situation than I did.  I gave him some airline peanuts I had in my
backpack, and the flowers (for his wife), pointed out I don't normally carry
cash and had given all the bills I had to Rebecca, and continued on to
McDonald's.</p>

<p>A block later there's a church which allows homeless people to congregate
on its steps.  There were eight of them, and a dog.  I got hit a third time,
and managed to find another fifty cents under my keys, then made it to
McDonald's.</p>

<p>I think my mistake was both that I walked instead of biked, and that I'm
wearing a shirt with buttons and a collar.  (Well I'm out of T-shirts.  I was
carrying cash because I thought I should really do laundry, but I only found
a little over $3 worth around the condo and I have a half dozen loads of
laundry to wash and dry.  Need to hit an Asynchronous Transfer Mode.)</p>

<p>But it's also that Austin ain't the city it was pre-Bush.  My first four
years here, I literally didn't see a single homeless person.  I remember
what a _shock_ it was when I saw someone panhandling at a street light
near the start of Bush's first term, around the dot-com/worldcom/enron
implosions.  (I'd seen it in Baltimore and New Jersey and such, but Austin
just hadn't had that.)  Now I can't walk to McDonald's without running a
gauntlet.  (There were always "drag rats" on Guadalupe, but they used to be
college students panhandling for spare change between classes.  It was
literally a hobby.)  Ever since Katrina, when FEMA imported and abandoned
several thousand additional homeless people into Austin (and far more to
Houston and Dallas), this city seems a bit overwhelmed.  It just hasn't got
the facilities to cope.</p>

<p>I'm currently looking out the McDonald's window to a sign that says
"NOTICE This Property Is Protected by 24-HOUR VIDEO SURVEILLANCE All Violators
Will Be Prosecuted".  I never noticed that before.</p>

<p>I really hope Obama helps the nation in a big way, but local impact is
second derivative.  We haven't cleaned the republicans out of state or
city government, and it'll take a while for national changes to trickle
down to Austin.</p>

<p>Apropos of nothing, I note that the hot chocolate from McDonalds' built-in
cafe thing is astoundingly mediocre.  It's a bit weak, the variety of chocolate
they used is kind of bland, and they scalded the milk.  Serviceable, but
not worth coffee shop markup prices.</p>

<p>Right, programming stuff.</p>

</span>
<span id=programming>
<p>Toysh needs infrastructure changes to break the current 1:1 mapping between
lines of input and commands to run.  There's already a little bit of support
for multiple commands per line ("one; two", "one | two", "one && two"...),
and fleshing that out is fairly straightforward.  But what I glossed over
the first time is that commands can stretch over multiple lines (by ending
with a backslash, by ending with pipe or logical operator, if statements,
loops...)  The command and pipeline structures have some support for this,
but the function calling convention is wrong: handle() returns void.  It needs
to be able to let its caller know it couldn't complete and needs more
data.</p>

<p>Ok, rename handle() to parse_and_run(), make it return a struct pipeline *
and accept one in its arguments as well.  Teach parse_pipeline to return
NULL when it ran out of data without finishing its current set of connected
commands (which is what a pipeline really is, since && and || set up a similar
logical grouping without actually being pipes).</p>

<p>Ok, new fun corner case, what should a shell's -c option do if it gets an
unfinished command?  Trying bash -c "echo hello \\" just gives me "hello"
(without even a trailing space, according to wc).  It's apparently appending a
blank line internally for \ continuations, but erroring out for &&.
(Specifically, bash -c "echo hello &&" gives me "bash: -c: line 1: syntax
error: unexpected end of file".  That's a lot of colons.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dash -c "echo hello \\" outputs "hello \", for 8 characters
according to wc as opposed to bash's 6.  (Trailing newline.)  Dash
also errors out for a trailing &&, with "dash: Syntax error: end of file
unexpected".</p>

<p>Actually, loathe as I am to admit it, dash seems to be a lot more sanely
implemented.  Bash has a different error message for bash -c "echo hello <"
(two lines this time, "bash: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexplected token
`newline'" and "bash: c: line 0: `echo hello <'".  So why is this line 0
for that, and line 1 for the other line?)</p>

<p>Sigh.  This was all clear in my head back in 2006, but now that I come
back to work on it again I don't remember why I'm only harvesting exit
codes if TOYSH_FLOWCTL or TOYSH_PIPES are enabled.  (Goes to read the
descriptions of those config options...  Ah, flowctl is for if/while/for
statements and pipes covers && and || and such.  So yeah, without those
the shell can't _use_ them.  Admittedly $? might care too, but the shell
couldn't act on the result...</p>

<p>Toysh started as an exercise in how far down you could strip a shell,
and wound up being noticeably smaller than busybox lash.  But in making
everything configurable, you get a darn useless shell if you disable
all of it.</p>

<span id=donotwant>
<p>Some time over the past week I got fed up and force uninstalled pulse
audio.  This turned out to be a bit of a trick because the ubuntu-desktop
package depends on it, but that's just a metapackage so I let it uninstall
that too and everything worked fine.  And suddenly, all my sound stuff
started working properly again.  No more guaranteed silence after a suspend
and resume unless I did cleanup with "kill" and "pavucontrol".  No more
problem starting a second app trying to use the sound and suddenly everything
going silent.  No more apps suddenly going silent for no reason in the middle
of playing something.</p>

<p>Pulse Audio is a mixer that can't mix, and it's unnecessary since the
ALSA layer does its own mixing.  (So once again, it's a piece of unnecessary
infrastructure that's supposed to do nothing, and fails to do it correctly.
Did I mention that Gnome is the official desktop of the FSF?)</p>

<p>What I didn't know was that it couldn't uninstall competently, either.</p>

<p>Today, Fade and I went to Fry's to get her iMac upgraded from 1 to 4
gigs of ram, and I had them look at my laptop too (although they didn't have
the memory it needed to bring it above 2 gigs in stock or something).  To
prepare for this, I actually shut it down instead of suspending.</p>

<p>When I got home, I booted it up, and gnome died.  I got a pop-up window
saying my session lasted less than 10 seconds and this was probably a bad
thing.  (No hint of a desktop, it went straight to this screen.)  When I
clicked on the only button it provided, it dumped me back at a login screen,
which auto-logged me in after 10 seconds, to give the pop-up window again.
There's no obvious way to STOP it from auto-logging me in (although the
timeout goes up to 30 seconds if I type something), so I can't get it to just
stay at the login screen.  (Thanks Gnome developers!)  I can however get it
to stay at the "your session lasted less than 10 seconds" warning box, so
ok.</p>

<p>Being a Linux geek of longstanding, I ctrl-alt-F1 and log in from a text
console.  Check dmesg: nothing.  Some strange residue in /tmp, is the .gnome
directory in ~landley horked, what's up with this?  And where the heck does
gnome log these sort of things.  Shouldn't that pop-up window have showed
me what the actual _problem_ was?  Go back to the pop-up window.  It doesn't
have more than one button, but it _does_ have a small print "view details"
checkbox.  Click that... and it immediately responds (why is it a checkbox
and not a button then?) by opening a sub-window and showing me the problem.
A few lines of noise, ending with:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Couldn't exec /usr/bin/pulse-session: No such file or directory.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Come on guys, I uninstalled this through dpkg, not by ripping it out by
hand, exactly to AVOID this kind of thing.  Sheesh.  (And why is it trying
to exec something out of the $PATH via an absolute /usr/bin/blah path anyway?
And why is the failure of an _optional_ service preventing the whole desktop
from launching?  Lack of sound is no reason to essentially brick the machine
from a nontechnical end-user's perspective.  Even Red Hat just did a pop-up
warning about an inability to initialize the sound card, the last thing I saw
kill the desktop bringup because something trivial was missing was Windows 98!
(Back around 1999 Reese deleted fonts she wasn't using to free up space on
her hard drive, but it turned out one of the help pages referenced one of
'em, and I got called in to figure out why her computer was booting into safe
mode with no explanation.  Ubuntu has now reproduced this experience for
me.)</p>

<p>Layers of broken here.  Layers.  Something that shouldn't have existed in
the first place because it did _nothing_ (or more accurately, failed to do
nothing correctly) also failed to clean up after itself in a way that caused
something way too brittle for words to die on startup rather than just warn
and move on, and then the failure was auto-retried to death.  And I didn't
find out about it until I rebooted the machine days later.</p>

<p>Long story short (too late!) I deleted the /etc/X11/Xsession.d/70pulseaudio
that dpkg left behind, and suddenly everything just worked again.  (It somehow
seems repetitive for X to have its own /etc/init.d directory.  Why on earth
would the sound mixer service be launched from X rather than from init?  I
also find it strange that /etc/rc.2 is a directory full of numbered symlinks
into init.d but Xsession.d has the actual files _and_ they're numbered, but oh
well...)</p>

<p>Dear Gnome/Ubuntu: you're doing it wrong.  Linux should not work like
an eggbeater.  Intricately interlocking complexity may seem like an elegant
design to you, but when a single piece of sand in the gears makes the entire
thing grind to a sudden halt, and you can't even find where the sand _is_
unless you know how every single piece fits together...  How exactly does
this qualify as "good design"?</p>

<p>Darn it, and shutting down ubuntu without killing kmail first corrupted
kmail's indexes.  (The process was killed while it was saving its state.)
Meaning I've lost track of which messages I'd marked read and which ones
were to-do or important, and all the windows I had open to reply to (which
ordinarily pop back open when I re-launch the program) are gone.  I had
something like 30 of them, pending half-finished emails to write...</p>

<p>I already hated gnome, but I think I'm working my way to "loathe"...</p>

of this he wrote a "how to ask smart questions" document, which I suppose
is nice if they read it before they email you.  (Pointing them at one seems
a bit of a brush-off: if they can't communicate clearly in english asking
them to read a lot of it may be a bit of a stretch.  Then again, he's at least
mildly famous and I'm not, so he gets even more email than I do, and needs
coping mechanisms for the volume.  I have yet to write up any form letters.)</p>

<p>Last day in Orange County, plane back to Austin leaves tomorrow morning.</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Tired.  Busy.  Received many conflicting todo items.</p>

<p>Never did get permission to see the base files that the 185k patch applied
to (going back and clearing more stuff with legal, not gonna happen before
we head back), so I'm back poking at the OpenWRT patches.  Mark's off doing
something else at the moment so I'm going through the OpenWRT patches again to
reproduce Mark's familiarity with them.  Apparently OpenWRT has
a fix to this DRAM issue somewhere in the pile (I did not know that), although
spotting patches we need to add is easy; elimintating stuff we _don't_ is
the hard part.  (At least it is when there's no "obvious crap" filter like
the past two days of filtering.  All the OpenWRT patches do _something_, the
question is whether it's something useful.)</p>

<p>I also need to build a stock 2.6.28 kernel and see if I can get it to do
anything on this hardware.  (I was working against a 2.6.25 base last time,
and most of the patches I was playing with were either for hardware we don't
need for an initramfs shell prompt via serial port, or it already got
merged.)</p>

<p>The California offices have free diet mountain dew, and Kona coffee, which
Mark really likes.  I should try it some day.  The caffeine is keeping me
upright.</p>
</span>

<p>Evening.  Hotel.  Brain-fried.  Words.  Thingy.</p>

<p>Watched about half of "300" on HBO (switching channels a lot).  Yeah, it's
a comic book all right.  I think the humans were the protagonists and the
monsters from "Doom II" were the bad guys.  Where they got a cave troll is
anybody's guess, although I'm guessing Ra brought them.  (The bad guy from
the "Stargate" movie was calling himself "Xerxes" this time, apparently this
covers the time period he was on earth the first time.)</p>

<p>Yeah, we went back to Claim Jumper's.  We thought "maybe we can get a small".
Didn't happen.  Garlic cheese toast again, and this time I got the tri-tip
steak thingies (so good).  This togo box has half a giant sweet potato
(covered with butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon), some excellent mashed
potatoes, and a large pile of my half of the bread pudding in a
to-go container.  Absolutely zero urge to eat any of it so far.</p>

<a name="21-01-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#21-01-2009">January 21, 2009</a></h2>

<span id=programming>
<p>So of the 185k patch, I wound up keeping 7837 lines total, and it turns out
it's not complete.  You know how OpenWRT has a directory full of files it adds
to the kernel source, and then has a bunch of patches
applied on top of that?  (Yes, the patches modify files out of the directory
of ones they added, and yes the patches add entire new files.)  Well, it turns
out they got that from broadcom.  OpenWRT seems to have started out based
on the Linksys source release (which upstream came from broadcom), and they
never questioned their initial design assumptions, so all these years later
they're still doing strange and horrible things.</p>

<p>Oh, and it doesn't apply to a stock 2.6.22 kernel.  It applies to
the 2.6.22 kernel off of linux-mips.org.  Yeah.  (Dear Broadcom: you're
doing it wrong.)</p>

<p>So diff the old linux-mips.org kernel against the old kernel.org kernel,
turn the directory of files into a second patch, appent the stripped down
_third_ patch on top of that, compile and boot the entire mess to make sure
that the 177k lines of patch I deleted didn't accidentally contain anything
interesting, and THEN start trying to figure out what all this stuff actually
does and how to transplant the interesting bits to the 2.6.28 or 2.6.29
kernel.</p>

<p>We went to "in and out burger" for dinner tonight.  They do burger

<p>It's over.  Thank goodness.</p>

<p>I'm enjoying the cornonation coverage, what little of it I've been able
to watch on the TV in Stephen's cubicle.  (Cisco's keeping me busy today,
and the Linux flash plugin's never reliably been able to watch MSNBC content;
if it starts playing it keeps going, but sometimes you reload a half dozen
times and it never starts, and this is one of those days.)</p>

<p>I stayed up way too late last
night watching the pre-game.  My hotel room has cable.  No Daily Show, but
MSNBC was rerunning Keith and Rachel over and over (in a way, this is a
vindication of them too), and the history cannel did a thing on the history
of the white house, biography did one on Obama followed by one on Gandhi, and
even BBC america was running a very interesting series on US history that I
should track down and throw in netflix.  (It's called "The american future",
they were having a marathon.)</p>

<p>Evening now, and they're rerunning the coronation.  (Yes, I'm willing to
watch Faux News for this if they're the only ones showing it.)  Switching away
to watch some of the other biographical specials on Obama on A&amp;E and such
(MSNBC is doing a good one; hopefully this means Keith and Rachel get some
sleep, they looked a bit punchy earlier today).</p>

<p>Heh.  I liked Obama's little unapologetic smirk when he repeated his full
name during the oath, despite the justice just using just his middle initial.
(No, you're not getting away with that here; the president's middle
name is "Hussein", deal with it.)</p>

<p>It's nice to actually feel patriotic again.</p>
</span>

<span id=programming>
<p>Cisco gave me a ginormous (6.5 megabyte, 180k+ lines) patch that's
the diff between stock 2.6.22 kernel and the broadcom one they're running
on the 610n.  Most of this is serious crap: they apparently did a global
search and replacing removing all comments containing the "fixme", "workaround",
or "xxx".  They removed any #if 0 segments, and trailing whitespace lines
at the end of files.  They updated every one of those magic CVS version
comments (often reverting them, everything everywhere is now version
1.1.1.1), and similarly changed a lot of instances of dates to August 3,
2007.  Oh, and they changed some indentation and wordwrapping too.</p>

<p>Spent several hours deleting pages and pages of noise out of this patch
during the day, and now up late at the hotel, listening to reruns of the
coronation coverage while deleting more unneeded patch hunks.</p>

<p>The trick is that if a hunk _only_ deletes code it's
almost certainly zapping comments or whitespace, and if it's only modifying
code lines it's almost certainly redoing whitespace or zapping comments at
the end of lines.  The interesting bits all add at least one line that wasn't
there before.  (There are occasional exceptions to this, but you can mostly
spot the patterns and thus hold down the "d" key and scan the hunks as they're
scrolling by for anything you don't recognize.  If you overshoot, there's
"u" to undo, which alas only has a hundred or so lines of backup you can do,
which occasionally isn't enough if a long file has one viable hunk after
several screens full of crap.  So I save every time I get to a good stopping
point and want to look up at the TV.)</p>

<p>I've deleted about 80k lines so far, and kept about 6500 lines
of actual code changes that might possibly be relevant.  Once I've got
a reasonably coherent patch, I need to build it, test it on the hardware,
try to port it to something more current than 2.6.22...  Might just post
what I've got to linux-mips as an "FYI", since Cisco's now got permission to
open source this.</p>

<p>Last night Mark and I went to a place called "Claim Jumper's" for dinner.
The appetizer was garlic parmesan onion rings, which were marvelous and
enormous.  I had the new england clam chowder in a bread bowl for the main
course, which was good but the menu showed their beef stew in the bread bowl,
and that's really what it was designed for I suspect.  The top of the loaf the
chopped off was toasted with cheese and served on the side, and that was really
good too.  Mark had bread pudding for dessert and I had the red velvet cupcake
(which despite the name was enormous, and had a large lump of whipped
cream/cream cheese frosting on top and chocolate syrup all over the place).
I took half the cupcake home, took it to work in the morning, and finished
it for lunch.</p>

<p>Tonight we went back to Claim Jumper's, split the garlic cheese toast as
an appetizer (better than the stuff that came with the bread bowl last night)
and both had the "whiskey chicken" main course (ooh, that was good).  I got
another red velvet cupcake thing (it's like 2 pounds, it's huge) and Mark
got the bread pudding again, which I tried a bit of and wound up eating
rather a lot of.  I took a large to-go box back to the hotel with chicken and
mashed potatoes and bread pudding, and ate it around midnight.  I think I've
eaten my entire week's worth of food already, and it's wednesday.  (I
still have a bag of Ritz chips left from the plane, which I ordinarily love
but just haven't ever been hungry for.  Mark and I are sharing a car and for
insurance reasons I'm the only one allowed to drive it (he's under 25, it's
darn expensive to get him rental insurance) so I have to drive him out for
food, meaning even though I was fine with the red velvet cupcake for lunch I
wound up going to Panera Bread with him anyway and so I had half an Asagio
roast beef sandwich I couldn't finish at lunch on top of the Claim Jumper's
leftovers.  (I ate that too, around midnight.  Well it was good.)</p>

<p>Somehow, kmail has decided that that my outbox folder has 2 new message(s)
in it despite only having 1 total message(s) in it.  And the "send queued

send, so I have to go to the outbox menu, double click a message to edit it,
and then click send in the new window.  I really need to find

<p>Fun comment from one of Rachel Maddow's guests, Ben Nelson, (D) Nebraska,

was a better one-liner.</p>

<p>Ok, added mkswap.  I should do swapon too, but I have a note that I need
to redo readlink, except I don't remember _why_.  Rummage, rummage...  Ah.
It's because the realpath() function out of libc only supports "NULL" as
the buffer when using glibc.  For uClibc, it won't allocate its own buffer,
it provides no feedback about how long the buffer should be, and silently
truncates with no error when given a buffer too short.  So yeah, the uClibc
version of readlink() is more or less useless.  So, implement my own, or
fix uClibc's readlink?  (I note these solutions will probably overlap.)</p>

<p>I may have broken a toe.</p>

<p>Fade and I spent most of today seeing houses for sale north of UT, about
half a mile northeast of where we are now.  With mortgage rates this low and
the current condo mostly paid off, trading up to something with 3 bedrooms,
2 baths, and a yard for the cats seems like a good idea.  Modulo being able to
get a mortgage, which has always been interesting with my "work when something
interesting comes along, take half a year off to do open source" job
history.</p>

<p>When we got home, Fade wanted to go to the alcohol store because she's
stressed out about the idea of moving again (especially having just signed up
for a semester of classes within easy biking distance of where we currently
are).  She walks about twice as fast as I do, and she had me carry one of the
bottles on the way back, and I also had the energy drink I'd bought, so I
slipped on mud on the sidewalk with both hands full while trying to keep up,
and came down with my entire weight on my right big toe.</p>

<p>This hurt, a lot.</p>

<p>On the bright side, it bled enough to get most of the mud off.  Walking
home was not fun.  Big bag of ice on it right now, which wasn't fun to apply
either.  Too swollen to tell if it's actually broken or just really unhappy

<p>Poking at the uClibc locale data thingy.  Figured out how to get a current
glibc localedata directory tarball (2.8 and 2.9 didn't ship tarballs, you
have to grab them from Red Hat's source control).</p>

<p>I'm still fighting with initramfs.  It turns out that if you don't enable
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD in the kernel .config then you don't get initramfs
support anymore.  (They changed this back in February 2007, now it
hardwires in "init/noinitramfs.c" instead.)  So it worked fine on i686
where this was enabled in the miniconfig, but not in mipsel which didn't
have it.  Wheee...</p>

<p>Got it to work.  Now to debug why the toybox df command isn't showing
initramfs.  Easy way to do this is to build toybox natively within
an initramfs, and since next week's demo is mipsel I'm doing this under
mipsel emulation.  And wow, building under mips emulation is _insanely_ slow.
(Much slower than building under arm emulation was.)  I don't know if
something's weird with qemu, or something's weird with gcc on a mips
host, or what.  It actually seems to be a gcc issue; the shell and makefile
are working reasonably, it's seems to be native gcc being Unhappy.
(Possibly running from initramfs is confusing its memory estimation
algorithms...?)  It could also have something to do with using qemu-svn
instad of the last release version, TCG is new and not necessarily
tweaked yet...</p>

<p>Nope, it's got to be gcc.  Extracting a 200k bzip2 file seems to run at
a semi-reasonable rate...</p>

<p>Ah, the reason df isn't reporting anything for rootfs is it's getting
a total size of 0 for the filesystem.  (It filters those out by default,
so you don't see /proc and /sys and such.)</p>

<a name="15-01-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#15-01-2009">January 15, 2009</a></h2>
<p>So today I bought a "monster energy drink" (citrus flavored), drank
the whole thing, started thinking clearly, and finally fixed initramfs.
(I have not made any tea in a week.  I've been blocked debugging initramfs
for a week.  These facts may be related.)</p>

<p>So initramfs is working.  Actually supplying the "console=" argument in the
version of the script that gets _run_ is useful.  (Poking through the code
to see why an option you're not passing isn't getting parsed?  Balancing the
wrong tree.)</p>

<p>The toybox df command is broken.  Need to fix that.  And finish up the
half-finished mkswap and swapon implementations I'm adding.  That should
be enough to cut a toybox release, clearing the way to upgrade the kernel
to 2.6.28...</p>

<p>Met with Mark and Stu for lunch.  Alas, I was operating on four hours of

<p>Debugging early kernel boot without a working console is evil.  (I
miss User Mode Linux, where you could stick a printf into the source code
and it didn't need a working console for you to see it.  Alas, UML doesn't
seem to like uClibc, so adding it as a hardware target is more time
consuming than just hitting the qemu version of initramfs directly with a
large rock until it gives in.)</p>

<p>Another long, frustrating day of debugging something that wouldn't
speak to me, but I finally got it to confess.</p>

<p>So the problem I've been having turns out to be that putting /dev/conosole
in initramfs and trying to use serial console is Unhappy.  This took many
many hours of staring at blank screens to track down.  Eventually after
spending yet another day frowning, guessing, reading source code, I
just booted the vga virtual terminal and _that_ worked.  I have an
initramfs shell prompt; the wrong _one_, but it's booting, and it's in
initramfs.</p>

<p>The console subsystem is the problem.  It's got a /dev/console which is
readable and writable and c 5 1, and when I don't feed it a console= argument
it happily writes out to the VGA virtual terminal.  (Why am I compiling _in_
the VGA virtual teriminal?  I need to strip down .config a bit, it seems.)
And once I've booted up to a prompt, if I mknod a /dev/ttyS0 that's c 4 64
and echo to it, I get serial output just fine.  If I say console=/dev/ttyS0,
I get nothing.  If I add /dev/ttyS0 to the initramfs, it doesn't help
either.</p>

<p>Right, NOW I can add printk() calls to the darn kernel to see what the heck
it thinks it's doing.  In the morning, anyway...</p>

<p>Here's an extract from an email I sent earlier today, apologizing for
being overworked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Right now I need to get initramfs packaging working, finish debugging the new 
hardware target mechanism for FWL, figure out what the heck's wrong with 
trying to use User Mode Linux as a fake hardware target for test purposes (I'd 
hoped to use that as a test platform for initramfs but it's turned into its 
own bottleneck, segfaulting before boot and refusing to statically link 
against uClibc), get powerpc working in the 2.6.28 kernel so I can finally 
leave 2.6.25 behind, upgrade the broadcom patch to work with 2.6.28 (some of 
it got merged so the current patch doesn't apply), upgrade trx packaging so 
it's adding the extra 32 byte header that the wrt610n needs, test out the 
uClibc-svn version, reimplement squashfs packaging and get the appropriate 
patch from the .git tree and report feedback to the kernel list in hopes of 
helping get it merged, make travel arrangmets to go to Cisco next week with 
mark, work out what Mark and I are demoing for the Cisco guys, get the xylinx 
toolchain paperwork signed and sent to that guy in australia for the toolchain
work Stu is doing through Impact Linux, meet Stu for dinner and get a status
report on that project...</p>

<p>That's what I remember off the top of my head. Â I'm know I'm forgetting all 
sorts of stuff. Â That's not counting the todo items for me Mark posted to the 
impact list (all those extra flags various commands need), or the two new todo 
lists he sent me during lunch (where we went over GFS and argued about the 
design a bit). Â Oh yeah, and I promised the uClibc guys I'd get some converted 
locale data for them. Â And the Neuros guys sent me some set top box hardware I 
haven't had a chance to _look_ at (took it over to Mark's so he could poke
at it a bit, but I haven't got an HDTV to hook it up to yet). Â The
micasaverde.com guys seem to have given up on me, I have their hardware sitting
under my kitchen table but haven't had time to look at it in two weeks; their
bug was almost certainly load-spike driven memory exhaustion, which they didn't
want to hear but it was  probably the truth. Â Couldn't easily _prove_ it under
a 2.4 kernel, though.</p>

<p>So yeah, I'll try to work cmake and dvv in there. Â Sorry for letting this
drop  on the floor so long...</p>

<p>Since then, the trip to California has gotten dates attached:
monday-wednesday next week, meaning sunday and thursday are taken up with
travel.  (Travel takes a day.  You can work with your laptop at the airport
and on the plane, but trying to stick it in at the beginning or end of a
day of doing other things just doesn't work.  Maybe under Obama it'll start
to again; he might dismantle the TSA completely.)</p>

<p>Things I forgot to mention:  put out a toybox release.  New one: dig
through the openwrt (or old linksys build) infrastructure and see what kind
of kernel image it's building if it's not a vmlinux and it's not a bzImage.
(Done.)  I'd like to push my miniconfig stuff upstream into the kernel...</p>

<p>Working on a hw-uml target to build User Mode Linux, which is fun to
debug things like initramfs with.  (A preposition is an excellent word to
end a sentence with.  And we start sentences with "and", and have been known
to boldly split infinitives that everybody has split before.)</p>

<p>I'd like to tell UML that its base arch is i686, but I can't see a way
to specify that.  Digging in the makefile... I have to specify "SUBARCH"
on the command line, which means I should add a LINUX_FLAGS like GCC_FLAGS
and BINUTILS_FLAGS.  Except this is a side issue, the x86_64 ARCH=um build
just went:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
fs/hostfs/hostfs_user.c: In function 'set_attr':
fs/hostfs/hostfs_user.c:302: error: implicit declaration of function 'futimes'
make[2]: *** [fs/hostfs/hostfs_user.o] Error 1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I am _so_ glad that I don't depend on this crud anymore.  Ok, try
2.6.28...  Ah yes, I need USE_UNSTABLE=toybox in order to apply the patches
to USE_UNSTABLE=linux.  And at least part of the broadcom patch is already
there in 2.6.28, so just symlinking it doesn't apply (yank it for now)...</p>

<p>And 2.6.28 has the exact same bug.  So in three releases, an obvious build
break hasn't been fixed.  I guess both the other users of User Mode Linux
gave up on it too?  Ah, no, it's a uClibc thing.  So UML won't build against
any release version of uClibc or older versions of glibc.  Right.</p>

<p>Ah, updating qemu-svn and rebuilding fixed the powerpc segfault I was
seeing.  Cool.</p>

<p>Wow User Mode Linux is crap.  I built an x86-64 version and it paniced
before giving me a shell prompt.  I tried to build an i686 version and it
went "no, you're building on a 64 bit host, you must be building a 64 bit
version".  The top level Makefile unconditionally calls "uname -m" and parses
its output; switching it to ?= isn't good enough because it's recursive
makefiles that don't pass all the environment variables through.  So it
cannot be cross compiled without patching the source, or providing a special
uname that lies.</p>

<p>Patched out uname -m and just hardwired in "i386", and that worked but
then the link died trying to statically link against uClibc.  Which is weird,
because it dynamically links against it just fine?</p>

<a name="11-01-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#11-01-2009">January 11, 2009</a></h2>
<span id=programming>
<p>Renamed package-mini-native.sh to system-image.sh, which is something
I've been meaning to do for a couple weeks.  Now the tarballs and the
scripts producing them all have the same name, but it'll be a while before
I stop typing "pack[tab]" to try to open the file.  (I'd have a similar
problem still putting around "2006" on my checks, except Fade does the
bills requiring mailing things, so I mostly pay for things with a debit card
or cash).</p>

<p>So in theory the "kill" command can specify jobs instead of PIDs.  (This
is why there's a shell builtin version instead of kill.)  Jobs are things you
background with & (or with ctrl-z and the bg command), and they're numbered
just like pids are.  The first one is #1, just like PID #1.  So "kill 1"
would try (and fail) to kill init.</p>

<p>The bash man page says "jobspec", but grepping for each instance of jobspec
it never once says what a jobspec _is_.  The "bg" command accepts just
raw numbers.  Luckily, <ahttp://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_203>SUSv4 does say what a jobspec is</a>, it's got
a percent sign in front of it.</p>

<p>And after all that, it doesn't help.  Jobs aren't visible to subshells,
so attempting to kill jobs from a signal handler doesn't work.  Luckily,
I solved this problem before (for the distccd called from run-emulator.sh):
'trap "kill $(jobs -p)" EXIT' does what I want because the $() inside the ""
is evaluated when the trap is set, so it resolves to process ID numbers before
the subshell gets run.  The problem is, you have to run that line _after_
you background the process, so there's a one line window where they
can hit ctrl-c and not kill the background process.  Still, at this point
I don't really care, it's primarily an aesthetic problem that's hard enough
to hit I'll stop fiddling with it and move on.</p>

<p>Sigh.  Except it's not working.  Killing the pipeline doesn't kill
the make process that's a child of it.  (I could trivially "killall make"
but that's the wrong solution; other make processes could legitimately
be running as the same user on the system; forkbomb.sh comes to mind.)</p>

<p>And "killall -g $(jobs -p)" isn't working because the busybox killall
command doesn't understand -g.  I can't do it myself with ps and
grep because the busybox ps command doesn't show parent process IDs (or any
parent/child relationship, really).  Groveling around in /proc myself seems
a bit overkill somehow.</p>

<p>The pipeline in question is (make blah-blah-blah || dienow)& and although
I could turn that into (exec make blah-blah-blah)& and thus eliminate
the subshell, then it wouldn't be able to report an error exit back to the
rest of the build.</p>

<p>Ah, according to SUSv4 "kill 0" takes out the current process group, and
THAT does what I want.  Right.</p>

<p>Mark told me the name of the kernel file I need to grab for hw-wrt610n,
but I don't remember it and the .config I have only seems to be building
vmlinux.  He also told me the name of the file that adds the extra
header to the trx image, but I don't remember which one it was.  (I'm
guessing <a href=https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/tools/firmware-utils/src/addpattern.c>addpattern.c</a> which produces a 32 byte structure, rather than
<https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/tools/firmware-utils/src/add_header.c>add_header.c</a> which doesn't.</p>

<p>This is why I like to have things emailed to me: I forget otherwise...</p>

frightening part is they would know.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Teaching FWL that a target can have a BASE_ARCH, where only packaging
varies (new kernel, same root filesystem).  (End result is that $ARCH is
set as normal, and $ARCH_NAME is the one you called.  Which was, in fact,
already the case.)  I'm trying to figure out if creating
cross-compiler-$ARCH -> cross-compiler-$ARCH_NAME symlinks (and so on) are
worth the complexity here.  (The problem is that the path $CROSS is set by
the build and cross-compiler.sh just uses it.  It got abstracted away,
now I need to manipulate it.  Maybe I should just link the tarballs...)</p>

<p>On the other hand, the end of cross-compiler.sh does a
"cd $BUILD; tar -f blah.tbz blah" so those paths aren't _really_ abstracted
away, are they?  CROSS is the path to the cross compiler you build things
with.</p>

<p>Hmmm, doing parallel builds with a BASE_ARCH is kind of tricky.  Assuming
that everything with a BASE_ARCH will have a hw- prefix (it's hardware) then
I need to teach buildall to build all the non-hw targets first, and then
do the hw ones.  And replicate the build.sh trick that if the tarball's
already there, don't rebuild the base.</p>

<p>There's always been a bit of tension between buildall reproducing build.sh
internally, vs just calling build.sh.  The problem was host-tools.sh: not
only do we not need to reproduce that part each build, but there was a
potential race condition where doing things like unconditionally reproducing
the symlinks could cause a build happening at the same time to not find
a command when it tried to use it.</p>

<p>Now that it checks for the existence of target stuff before trying to
rebuild it (including symlinks to the host toolchain), I think it should
be ok.  There's still the whole "$CROSS_BUILD_STATIC" rigamorole (buiding
an i686 target and rebuilding in that under qemu), but I'll worry about
that later...</p>

<p>So I've got to rewrite the buildall script for the... fifth time?  Sigh.</p>

<p>Phone call with David Mandala yesterday about the amazon computing
cloud.  He's put together some Ubuntu images to feed into there, and got
a little bit of budget for Mark and myself to test out our FWL builds
under that.  I immediately handed this over to Mark (who is much better
at this sort of thing), and he reported back that what we want is their
<a href=http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#instance>High-CPU
Extra Large Instance with cheese fries</a>, which gives us an 8-way 2.5 ghz
64 bit processor, 7 gigabytes of ram, and 1.6 terabytes of disk for
<a href=http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#pricing>80 cents/hour</a>.  Between runs
they give you persistent storage at 10 cents per gigabyte each month.</p>

<p>Assuming we run two hours worth of nightly builds ($1.60 times 30 days is
$48) and grab maybe 20 gigs of persistent local storage in their cloud ($2),
that's about $50/month.  If we bought our own build server it might
_depreciate_ faster than that.</p>

<p>Mark is now more or less drooling with anticipation, and configuring this
sort of thing is an area where he's way better than me anyway so I'm happy
to stay out of his way for the moment.  What _I'm_ looking forward to is making
this work out of the box with FWL, and documenting how to use it so _other_
people can easily use FWL to do native builds under emulation on monster
hardware at prices available to hobbyists.</p>
</span>

<p>Oh wow.  It's 2am at Jimmy John's and the music is doing a rock version
of "What a wonderful world", apparently by the Ramones.  (Due to its position
at the end of the BBC miniseries version of The Hittchiker's Guide to the
Galaxy, I've always considered the original Louis Armstrong version of that
to be "end of the world" music.  Even more so than Carmina Burana, which is
merely "somebody set off a self destruct, please either reach minimum safe
distance or go switch it off" music.  Not quite the same life flashing before
your eyes quality.)</p>

<p>Because of this, my brain is more bent than you'd expect by a rock version
of what was originally a melancholly song normally TOTALLY outside any normal
genre I'd be interested in, but grandfathered in because The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy was fairly close to a religion for me growing up.  (It
teaches that refuge in absurdity can cope with anything, you just have to get
absurd ENOUGH.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>At some point over the past week, I broke FWL.  The images it's building
won't boot; the kernel messages scroll by but they never find their root
filesystem.  I have no idea WHY, and no idea what I did, but they're
working for Mark.  So...</p>

<p>Grab a fresh snapshot from hg into a new directory, do the
PREFERRED_MIRROR=http://127.0.0.1/code/firmware/mirror trick and... I
apparently forgot to copy the current versions of uClibc, busybox,
and genext2fs into the mirror directory.  Right, fix that.  NOT using the
UNSTABLE versions of anything, let's build and... it doesn't boot.  Ok,
set PATH to exclude /usr/local/bin so I'm using the Ubuntu version of qemu
instead of the svn one... That wasn't it.</p>

<p>Binary search time!  Ok, try commit 540... and I forgot to check
busybox 1.13.0 into the mirror too.  (Once upon a time, my main working
sources/packages directory was a link to the build directory, so it
automatically updated with every package I actually used.  But then I
implemented the logic to delete old unused versions, and separated the two.
I need to do add some copying logic to wwwsend.sh.)</p>

<p>And I have no internet access at Jimmy John's...  But I can just tweak
download.sh to have busybox-1.13.1, I know that's not the problem.  Zero
out the sha1sum so it doesn't have an immune reaction to the wrong tarball
and rebuild... And commit 540 worked.  (Which is good, it _used_ to work, and
that means it's not something funky about my laptop or qemu.)</p>

<p>But 560 is broken.  Ok, it's been dead for a while longer than I thought.
(You'd think I would have noticed.  But I was busy exorcising perl...)
550... worked.  555... failed.</p>

<p>Continue this in the morning.</p>

<p>And it's morning.  (Miracles of the internet, eh?)</p>

<p>553 failed, rechecked 550, it worked, so the mercurial "forgetting" messages
weren't about leaving sources/patches files behind that might screw up the
build.  (Good to know.)  552... worked.  It's 553.  Which was moving the
kernel build from mini-native to package-mini-native.sh.</p>

<p>Alright, what changed?  Try booting the new kernel with the old root
filesystem... failed.  New root filesystem with old kernel... worked.  It's
the kernel.  Which is 32 bytes larger...</p>

<p>HA!  Ok, USE_INITRAMFS needs to start with a $ or it's always going to
trigger the if clause.  Right.  That took _way_ too long to track down.
(But of course I didn't see it _looking_ at the code.  I knew what I meant.)</p>
</span>

<a name="07-01-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#07-01-2009">January 7, 2009</a></h2>
<span id=programming>
<p>So the reason that initramfs isn't working is that gen_initramfs_list.sh
is using "find -printf", which busybox doesn't support.  Specifically, it
needs %T %p %m %U and %G.  And yes, it's a gnu extension that isn't in the
<a href=http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/find.html>SUSv4
find</a>.</p>

<p>Hmmm, do I patch busybox to add -printf to find, do I try to push a patch
up into the kernel to change gen_initramfs_list.sh to stop using the gnu
extension, do I implement find in toybox, do I write my own
gen_initramfs_list.sh...</p>

<p>Mark is blocked and waiting for this functionality.  Right...</p>

<p>Ok, so I wrote a new very small script to create the text file from the
directory, but if I then feed it into the kernel infrastructure it goes "boing"
because it needs find -print in order to figure out it's argument is a text
file.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>I hate makefiles.  I'm creating a usr/initramfs_data.cpio.gz file in the
kernel source.  It's newer than any other file in the source.  But it's
rebuilding it.  Why does make decide to rebuild it?  How does one single step
through a makefile's rebuild decisions?  Ok, with make -d, but when is says:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Considering target file `usr/gen_init_cpio'.
  Considering target file `usr/gen_init_cpio.c'.
   Looking for an implicit rule for `usr/gen_init_cpio.c'.
   Trying pattern rule with stem `gen_init_cpio.c'.
   Trying implicit prerequisite `usr/gen_init_cpio.c_shipped'.
   No implicit rule found for `usr/gen_init_cpio.c'.
   Finished prerequisites of target file `usr/gen_init_cpio.c'.
  No need to remake target `usr/gen_init_cpio.c'.
  Pruning file `FORCE'.
 Finished prerequisites of target file `usr/gen_init_cpio'.
 Prerequisite `usr/gen_init_cpio.c' is older than target `usr/gen_init_cpio'.
 Prerequisite `FORCE' of target `usr/gen_init_cpio' does not exist.
Must remake target `usr/gen_init_cpio'.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Where does "FORCE" come from?  The only instance in linux/usr/Makefile
is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$(obj)/initramfs_data.o: $(obj)/initramfs_data.cpio.gz FORCE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that's for a different target which is a downstream consumer of
this stuff...  (And removing it doesn't help anyway.)</p>

<p>Ok, build the kernel, _then_ replace the initramfs_data.cpio.gz file, then
build the kernel _again_, and it works.  Right.  So now it's a question of
getting it generated right.</p>

<p>I can get the whole mess parallelized by using the funky bash argument
pipeline syntax ( going <(command) looks like a command line argument but
works like a pipe), so the gen_initramfs_list.sh creates a file list in
parallel with gen_init_cpio creating a cpio image, and then piping the output
of that into gzip runs in parallel as well.  Plus I can background all that
so it runs in parallel with building the kernel the first time.  (A three
way process plus make -j $CPUS... eh, reasonable.)</p>

<p>Now the problem is that the initramfs could have spaces in filenames
(or more likely, the absolute path in $NATIVE could have a space in the
directory the build is running in).  Ooh, which option is least ugly...
I guess trim off $PWD/ if $NATIVE starts with it?</p>

<p>This is fiddly.</p>

<p>Add an /init symlink to qemu-setup.sh which lives in either usr or tools
depending on how $NATIVE_TOOLSDIR is set, and qemu-setup.sh cares what name
it's called under so switch that to check that it's _not_ chroot-setup.sh
(because /init should perform qemu-setup, not chroot-setup)...</p>

<p>No, hang on, that's stupid.  If we're pid 1, perform qemu setup.  If not,
perform chroot-setup.  Why didn't I do that in the first place?</p>

<p>Too busy to blog for most of today.  Caught up with email, then wasted some
time trying to figure out why the kernel isn't mounting the root device (it's
_finding_ it, according to the init messages, but then insists that root= is
incorrect) before just focusing on making initramfs work and so I can debug
it from a shell prompt.  Before I could finish taht, went with Fade to ACC
so she could register, we stopped at Starbucks for a bit, showed her the
Curves location on Lavaca and Guadalupe (she enjoyed going there in
Pittsburgh, and it turns out we do have one near us), and then headed home.
Conference call with Stu and John from Australia at 6pm got delayed to 7pm,
didn't manage to catch up with Sal in between (left a voicemail), and then
dinner with Victor Meyerson (Gentoo embedded guy in town for a conference,
calculus on freenode), quick nap, then off to Whataburger for some quiet time
with my laptop.</p>

<p>I keep forgetting how broken Ubuntu 7.10 is.  Somewhere along the way
(starbucks, probably) I queued up some Youtube videos people linked me which
I didn't have time to watch, but any programs running when I suspend the
system confuse the horrible Gnome sound mixer server, and I have to kill them
(losing the cached data I told it to download by hiting play and then pressing
pause) and restart in order to get it to work.  The way Firefox is designed,
this means I have to kill the flash plugin taking out every flash instance in
all windows.</p>

<p>Bravo, Ubuntu, firefox, and gnome.  A trifecta of suck.  (I miss Konqueror,
kde 3, and its not-brain-damaged sound mixer.  I don't actually know what this
sound mixer is FOR since I'm told ALSA in the kernel now does it, but as with
much of the gnome, or the HAL network status network mangler sets, or libtool:
it does nothing when it's working right.  It's an unnecessary glue layer that
exists to add the possiblity of failure to something that would otherwise work
reliably in its absence.  Simple systems are nice because infrastructure that
doesn't exist can't break.)</p>

<p>And so the first day with Mark working full-time for impactlinux.com.
Woot.  (He's likely to accomplish more in a week than I do in a month,
but he's a lot more focused than I am.  I tend to wander off onto a dozen
different tangents at once, he grabs one and FINISHES it, then moves on.
Breadth first vs depth first approaches; we work together very well.)</p>

<p>I hung out at Chick-fil-a for half the day, trying to bang on the initramfs
packaging but mostly getting distracted by busybox and kernel stuff.
(My email overfloweth.)</p>

<p>Mark's banging away at building gentoo embedded under mini-native, and
already has a <a href=http://bugs.python.org/issue4305>patch</a> for
building python on mips submitted upstream.</p>

<p>The embedded world in general tends to lag several releases behind
cutting edge for userspace tools, just because so much breaks.  (Crazy
guys like us are allowed to do the sheep across minefields thing first.)
Now try adding cross compiling complexity to that...</p>

<p>Lots of bug reports from Milton Miller last night.  (He's using FWL
to target the PS3, real hardware rather than a qemu instance.)  Half of them
were in Toybox, which I need to get a new release out of soonish.</p>

<p>Mark got the trx packaging script (for linksys router images) to
produce the right crc, but it turns out it needs to be initialized to
FFFFFFFF instead of 0, and there's no switch for cksum to make it do that.
(Well, none in busybox or the gnu version.  The old unix one from the dawn
of time apparently had it, but it fell by the wayside over the years.)
Added a -F flag to toybox cksum to do that, might push it up into busybox,
might just say USE_TOYBOX if you want this functionality...</p>

<p>Met Mark for a late lunch (at firebowl) and we went over todo items for this
week.  He's finishing up the first stage trx packaging (getting a trx-packaged
image to boot a kernel to a shell prompt via initramfs) once I get him the
new crc stuff and get initramfs packaging finished and checked in, and in
the meantime he's working on the gentoo build stuff.</p>

<p>I have those two, plus following up on the perl removal push, plus
trying to cleanup/push the openwrt patches needed for the broadcom stuff (they
have patches in their svn to support this for 2.6, they just haven't pushed
'em upstream for some reason; I should ask).  Plus working on the Linux From
Scratch build script and trying to get other hardware targets working.</p>

<p>The <a href=http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/download>download
link</a> for
<a href=http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/toc.htm>SUSv4</a>
isn't up yet, so I'm using wget --mirror on the URL instead.
(Vaguely impolite but I'm not always on the web when I want to look something
up, and still using SUSv3 when SUSv4 is out.)</p>

<p>Ooh, to mount an ext3 partition read only without replaying the journal
(and thus writing to the underlying block device):</p>

<blockquote><p>mount -o ro,noload /dev/XXX /mntpt</p></blockquote>

<p>Good to know.</p>

<p>There should be a phrase to say "this objection is a stand-in for another
objection, you're not really upset about the thing you're objecting about
you just think it's a more effective argument than the one motivating
you to do this".  Proxy objection?  I googled a bit and the closest I got was
<a href=http://www.ir35calc.co.uk/objections_and_objection_handling.aspx>real
and unreal</a>, which isn't right.  ("That's not your real objection" doesn't
make the other objection _unreal_.  It makes it a stand-in or a proxy,
something you're only motivated to care about by the real objection.)</p>

<p>I called Cathy Raymond (a full-time lawyer) and she didn't have a legal
term of art for it.  (Apparently it's _too_ common there to have a specific
name.)  I guess I'll use "proxy objection".</p>

<p>Yeah, this came up in regards to the perl stuff.  I'm told that in the
past year Peter Anvin has changed his other projects (syslinux and klibc)
to require perl to build, when they didn't used to.  (I know Perl has
fallen from third most popular programming language to eleventh in the
past few years, but isn't taking the "Windows everywhere" approach
overreacting a touch?)</p>

<p>I strongly suspect that all the stuff about dash vs bash is just a proxy
objection, which nobody would care about if it wasn't for perl vs not perl.</p>

<p>Fixed the overflow error in the shell script.  It was actually pretty
simple.  Also incorporated the feedback Sam Ravnborg sent me the first day.
Now comes the hard part: wading through the email from the mailing
list and replying to it all.</p>

<p>I'm installing a more recent 32-bit xubuntu in a qemu image so I can test
Matthieu Castet's assertion that current versions of dash on 32 bit hosts
provide 64 bit math, but the cursor keys aren't working in the current svn
version of qemu.  Pinged the list, and installed the release version of
qemu in the mean time.  Much email to reply to, much testing.  (The patches
are up in the FWL repository already, by the way.  alt-linux-noperl*.patch)</p>

<p>Trying to make it over to Mark's place so we can go over the router stuff.
This perl removal stuff has eaten my entire week, work-wise.</p>
</span>

<p>Ok, <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/elzes/3159087152/>I should
shave</a>.</p>

<p>Intalled a 32-bit Xubuntu 8.10 because I'd heard that dash supports
64 bit math on 32 bit systems in current ubuntu.  (Confirmed.)  It took about
4 hours, and was so slow that at several points I thought it had hung.  I note
that Xubuntu is the lean and mean, stripped down desktop.  And I gave it
256 megs instead of the 128 qemu defaults to.  (Maybe I've been spoiled by
TCG, but the current qemu svn doesn't have working cursor keys for some
reason so I had to use the release version.)</p>

<a name="02-01-2009"><hr><h2><a href="#02-01-2009">January 2, 2009</a></h2>
<p>Spent a couple hours today removing grafitti from the alley behind
my condo.  I bought about $50 worth of paint and stripper and tools at
Home Despot a couple days before New Year's, and it wasn't enough.  (I
still have some paint stripper left, evil gloop that stings when you drip
some on your foot.  How they got gel to work in spray bottle is a mystery for
the ages.)  But the big wall on the back of the abandoned strip
mall Cuatros bought to use as extra parking was at least a two gallon wall,
maybe three, and I only had one.  Still, managed to produce a statement of
intent, if nothing else.  Need more paint.  (And another roller/tray pack.)</p>

<p>The trigger for this was some idiot tagging the front of my condo's building
with orange spray paint, and the stoneleigh garage I have a parking space in.
They also tagged up and down the alley.  (It's like when dogs pee on a wall,
only with spraypaint.  Alas, animal control won't mount rooftop snipers to
dart 'em, tag 'em, and release them into the wild on some other continent.
Budgetary issues, I guess.)  The alley's had grafitti in it for years, but
it used to be _artistic_ and now it's just tags.  And then last week some
idiot tagged the same alley in eleven places, plus elsewhere outside the
alley.  (Can we say "overcompensating"?)</p>

<p>I suspect it's the "Mad Honker", the idiot who honked a brass instrument off
his balcony randomly between midnight and 5 am (sounded like an air horn,
but wasn't) every night for a couple months until the police tracked him down
and actually enforced the noise ordinances at him.  I'm just guessing that
the tagging's the same guy, but the timing is right, and both activities have
the same sort of desperate urge to make people notice whoever it is, without
providing anything anyone would _want_ to notice, and while remaining
anonymous.  (See, this is what the INTERNET is for.  Get with the terminal
program.)</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href=http://valhenson.livejournal.com/30100.html>grafitti
attracts more grafitti</a>, so I thought I'd do my whole
White Boy Possee thing (our tag is solid colors over large areas, and we
OWN this town) and see what happens.  I suspect I can roller more than
they can spray, partly because I don't worry if somebody else sees me do
it.</p>

<p>Wound up napping for a few hours after that until the fumes wore off.
(Painting is way more aerobic than you'd think, and combines it with things
you aren't supposed to breathe.)</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Lots of replies to the perl removal patch series I posted last night.
Respinning the patches to fix the things Sam Ravnborg commented on.</p>

<p>And it's miscalculating USEC_TO_HZ_ADJ32 for 24hz and 122hz.  (All the other
HZ values give all the right values, and the other values are right for those
two HZes.  What is this, an integer overflow?  Yup.  Ok, that's fixable,
but probably not tonight.)</p>

<p>Hello world!</p>

<span id=programming>
<p>Back banging on the first perl removal patch, rewriting the time constant
generation script in shell.</p>

<p>So dc doesn't support bit shift operators (<< and >>).  I can fake it with
exponentiation, but although the gnu dc supports "^", the busybox version
doesn't recognize it.  Great.  I have to write a dc for toybox.  Ok, I can do
that _after_ getting the perl removal patch rewritten and submitted.  I hope
merge window for 2.6.29 stays open a little longer than usual due to the
holidays...</p>

<p>And looking up the "dc" spec in susv3, I find out there isn't one.  The
"bc" command is in susv3, but that describes an entire _language_ and busybox
doesn't implement it so it's apparently not that widely used...</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>You know, it's possible to fake 64 bit math from 32 bit math.  Presumably
if the shell $((blah)) operator can be trusted to handle 32 bit math...</p>

<p>Actually, the fmul() stuff this is _never_ going to be more than 64 bits
because it's ((TIME<<32)+HZ-1)/HZ and TIME is either 1000 (for miliseconds)
or 1000000 (for microseconds).  Oh hang on, that's just a fixed position
binary fraction with rounding up.  (The upper 32 bits is the integer value,
the lower 32 bits is a binary fraction of what's left over.)</p>

<p>Ok, some comments really would have helped here.  That doesn't need
fixed point, that just needs 64 bit math.  Can I rely on the shell to give
me 64 bit math?  As does busybox ash in my mini-native images, and even
the Defective Annoying Shell. Let's see, I've got an old red hat 9 image lying
around that probably _won't_ do so.  (A 32 bit system from 2003, using gcc
3.2 and bash 2.05b.)  And yes, it gives me 64 bit math!)</p>

<p>Ok, that becomes fairly trivial then.  I can just use shell math for all
this...</p>

<p>Ah, no I can't.  The Defective Annoying SHell on a _32_ bit host says
that $((1<<31)) is "-214783568", and that $((1<<33)) is "2".  Yup, it continues
to screw up any attempts to write shell scripts.</p>

<p>Ok, just say #!/bin/bash at the top.</p>

<p><a href=http://impactlinux.com/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/firmware/file/560/sources/patches/alt-linux-noperl.patch>DONE.</a></p>

<p><a href=http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0901.0/00148.html>And
