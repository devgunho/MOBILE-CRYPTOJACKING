Flickr became an appealing resource for facial recognition researchers because many users published their images under âCreative Commonsâ licenses, which means that others can reuse their pictures without paying license fees. Some of these licenses allow commercial use.</p><p class="">To build its Diversity in Faces dataset, IBM says it drew upon a collection of <a href="https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=i&amp;did=67">100 million images published with Creative Commons licenses that Flickrâs owner, Yahoo, released as a batch for researchers to download in 2014</a>. IBM narrowed that dataset down to about 1 million photos of faces that have each been annotated, using automated coding and human estimates, with almost 200 values for details such as measurements of facial features, pose, skin tone and estimated age and gender, according to the dataset obtained by NBC News.</p><figure class="medium___16lj6"><div style="height:50px" class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><figcaption class="caption___fMPAB f3 lh-copy grey-100 publico-txt caption___1mNth mt4"><span class="mr3">IBM calculated dozens of measurements for every face included in the dataset.</span><span class="f2 ls-tight gray-80 ws-tight founders-mono dib">IBM</span></figcaption></figure><p class="">Itâs a single case study in a sea of datasets taken from the web.

IBM has also released an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/video-analytics-for-security/details">âintelligent video analyticsâ product</a> that uses body camera surveillance to detect people by âethnicityâ tags, such as Asian, black or white.</p><p class="">IBM said in an email that the systems are ânot inherently discriminatory,â but added: âWe believe that both the developers of these systems and the organizations deploying them have a responsibility to work actively to mitigate bias. Itâs the only way to ensure that AI systems will earn the trust of their users and the public.
