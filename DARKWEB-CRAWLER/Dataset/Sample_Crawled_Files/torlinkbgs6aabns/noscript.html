Yes, it can.
Some GreaseMonkey user scripts just work only on pages where JavaScript is <strong>allowed</strong>,
but most of them will work anyway.<br />
For instance, if you're a Mozillazine forum user, you may want to install the GreaseMonkey script
featured in <a href="#qa5_1">this FAQ</a>, making your life easier if you prefer to keep

Can adblockers work with NoScript?

      <br /><a name="a1_4"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
Even if NoScript does block many advertisements as a side effect,
its main focus is on security, hence it misses some fine-grained controls over ads delivery
which you can find in proper adblocking products.
On the other hand, NoScript provides unique protection features against Web-based attacks, such as XSS or Clickjacking, and
a high level of reliability, which are not available in adblockers.
Therefore NoScript and adblockers, such as Adblock Plus or uBlock, complement each other.
You can use them together for a secure and quiet browsing.

      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
If you're a security-minded user, you probably want to build your own customized whitelist
suiting your needs and keep it as short as you can.<br />
Therefore, when you install NoScript for the first time, you've got a <em>very short</em> default whitelist of sites you can
<a href="#qa1_11">trust</a>:
<ol>
<li>
<b>chrome:</b><br />
It can't be removed because it is the privileged pseudo-protocol
used by Firefox internal scripts: disabling it would prevent the browser itself from working.
</li>
<li><b>about:xyz, moz-safe-about:, resource:</b><br />
A bunch of internal pseudo URLs. They can't be removed because they help your browser to work as expected.
</li>
<li><b>blob:, mediasource:</b><br />
Internal pseudo URLs identifying content generated by a script.  They can't be removed because if you have these on a page, you already allowed the script generating them, so no point treating them separately.
</li>
<li><b>about:pocket*</b><br />
Internal URLs of the Pocket service, distributed as part of Firefox.</li>
<li>
<b>addons.mozilla.org</b> and <b>mozilla.net</b><br />
The add-ons Mozilla website and the domain serving its static content for performance reasons. You probably installed NoScript and any other extension you've got from there.
Also, they are the same people who made your browser - you trust these guys, don't you?
</li>
<li><b>noscript.net</b><br />
You just installed NoScript on your system, running with the privileges of your web browser.
If you don't trust it, you've got a much bigger problem than JavaScript on its website (strictly HTTPS) ;)
</li>
<li><b>paypal.com</b>, <b>paypalobjects.com</b> (Paypal)</li>
<li><b>securecode.com</b>, <b>securesuite.net</b>, <b>firstdata.com</b>, <b>firstdata.lv</b> (required by popular credit card verification systems)</li>
<li><b>youtube.com, ytimg.com, googlevideo.com</b><br />
Youtube, where basic video reproduction may work scriptless, but most other features require them</li>
<li>
<b>netflix.com, nflxext.com, nflximg.com, nflxvideo.net</b><br />
required for Netflix video playback</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>google.com, ajax.googleapis.com, maps.googleapis.com, and gstatic.com</b> (GMail, Google Maps and other Google services)</li>
<li><b>hotmail.com, msn.com, passport.com, passport.net, passportimages.com, live.com, live.net, outlook.com, afx.ms, gfx.ms, sfx.ms, wlxrs.com</b>
(Microsoft webmail services)</li>
<li><b>yahoo.com, yimg.com, yahooapis.com</b> (Yahoo! Mail)</li>
</ul>
All these sites have been added to enable JavaScript on the most popular AJAX-based webmail services "out of the box".
This way, even if some users installs NoScript without understanding what they're doing,
and they've got no idea about
how NoScript works, they can still ask for help by email.
</li>
<li><b>ajax.aspnetcdn.com bootstrapcdn.com code.jquery.com yandex.st tinymce.cachefly.net</b><br />

Obviously, if any of the entries above (except <b>chrome:</b> and some <b>about:xyz</b> ones) bothers you for any reason,
you can delete it at any time by using either <i>NoScript Options|Whitelist|Remove</i> or
the regular <i>Forbid</i> commands.

This is a sound that Markus kindly offered me while suggesting to provide

Of course, you can disable it whenever you want changing

      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
You <b>must not</b> disable JavaScript in Firefox! NoScript will allow/forbid scripts, but they have
to be kept enabled by default, as it almost always is.
On Firefox 24 or above this is a hidden about:config preference
(<strong>javascript.enabled</strong>) which must preserve its default <em>true</em> value.
<strong>On older Firefox versions only</strong> (23 or below) you may want to check that
<i>Tools|Options|Content|Enable JavaScript</i>* option is still checked (JavaScript enabled),

      <span class="QA">Q: &nbsp;</span><b>
Why can I sometimes see <i>about:blank</i> and/or <i>wyciwyg:</i> entries in my NoScript menu? What scripts are causing this?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a1_9"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
<i>about:blank</i> is the common URL designating empty (newly created) web documents.<br />
A script can "live" there only if it has been injected (with <i>document.write()</i> or DOM manipulation, for instance) by another script which must have its own permissions to run.<br />
It usually happens when a master page creates (or statically contains) an empty sub-frame (automatically addressed as <i>about:blank</i>) and then populates it using scripting.<br />
Hence, if the master page is not allowed, no script can be placed inside the <i>about:blank</i> empty page and its "allowed" privileges will be void.<br />
Given the above, risks in keeping <i>about:blank</i> allowed should be very low, if any.<br />
Moreover, some Firefox extensions need it to be allowed for scripting in order to work.<br />
Sometimes, especially on partially allowed sites, you may see also a <i>wyciwyg:</i> entry. It stands for "What You Cache Is What You Get",
and identifies pages whose content is generated by JavaScript code through functions like <i>document.write()</i>.
If you can see such an entry, you already allowed the script generating it,
hence the above <i>about:blank</i> trust discussion applies to this situation as well.

      <span class="QA">Q: &nbsp;</span><b>
Why should I allow JavaScript, Java, Flash and plugin execution only for trusted sites?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a1_10"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">JavaScript</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Java</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Flash</a>,
even being very different technologies, do have one thing in common: they execute on your computer code coming from a remote site.
<br />
All the three implement some kind of sandbox model, limiting the activities remote code can perform:
e.g., sandboxed code shouldn't read/write your local hard disk nor interact
with the underlying operating system or external applications.
<br />
Even if the sandboxes were bullet proof (not the case, read below) and even if you or your operating system wrap the whole browser with another sandbox
(e.g. IE7+ on Vista or Sandboxie),
the mere ability of running sandboxed code <b>inside</b> the browser can be exploited for malicious purposes,
e.g. to steal important information you store or enter on the web (credit card numbers, email credentials and so on)
or to "impersonate" you, e.g. in fake financial transactions, launching "cloud" attacks like
<a href="https://noscript.net/features/#xss">Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</a> or CSRF,
with no need for escaping your browser or gaining privileges higher than a normal web page.
This alone is enough reason to allow scripting on trusted sites only.
<br />
Moreover, many security exploits are aimed to achieve a "privilege escalation",
i.e. exploiting an implementation error of the sandbox to acquire greater privileges and
perform nasty task like installing trojans, rootkits and keyloggers.
<br />
This kind of attack can target JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins as well:
<br />
<ol type="1"><li><a href="http://secunia.com/search/?search=javascript" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript</a> looks like a very precious tool for bad guys: most of the fixed
browser-exploitable vulnerabilities discovered to date were ineffective if JavaScript was disabled.
Maybe the reason is that scripts are easier to test and search for holes, even if you're a newbie hacker:
everybody and his brother believe to be a JavaScript programmer :P
<br />
</li><li><a href="http://secunia.com/search/?search=jre" target="_blank" rel="external">Java</a>
has a better history, at least in its "standard" incarnation, the Sun JVM.
<br />
There have been viruses, instead, written for the Microsoft JVM, like the ByteVerifier.Trojan.
Anyway, the Java security model allows signed applets (applets whose integrity and origin are guaranteed by a digital certificate)
to run with local privileges, i.e. just like they were regular installed applications.
This, combined with the fact there are always users who, in front of a warning like "This applet is signed with a bad/fake certificate.
You DON'T want to execute it! Are you so mad to execute it, instead? [Never!] [Nope] [No] [Maybe]",
will search, find and hit the "Yes" button, caused some <a href="http://www.vitalsecurity.org/2005/03/xpi-installers-plus-java-applets.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">bad reputation even to Firefox</a> (notice that the article is quite lame, but as you can imagine had much echo).
<br />
</li>
<li><a href="http://secunia.com/search/?search=flash" target="_blank" rel="external">Flash</a> used to be considered relatively safe, but since its usage became so widespread <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/security/security_zone/#flashplayer" target="_blank" rel="external">severe security flaws have been found at higher rate</a>.
Flash applets have also been exploited to launch <a href="https://hackademix.net/2008/01/06/flash-xss-protection-for-users/">XSS attacks</a> against the sites where they're hosted.
<br />
</li><li>Other plugins are harder to exploit, because most of them don't host a virtual machine like Java and Flash do,
but they can still expose holes like buffer overruns that may execute arbitrary code
when fed with a specially crafted content.
Recently we have seen several of these <a href="https://hackademix.net/2007/12/05/plugin-security-plug-insecurity/">plugin vulnerabilities</a>,
affecting Acrobat Reader, Quicktime, RealPlayer and other multimedia helpers.
<br />
</li></ol>
Please notice that none of the aforementioned technologies is <em>usually</em> (95% of the time) affected by
<em>publicly known and still unpatched</em> exploitable problems,
but the point of NoScript is just this: preventing exploitation of <em>even unknown yet</em> security holes,
because when they are discovered it may be too late ;)<br />
The most effective way is disabling the potential threat on untrusted sites.

      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>A "trusted site" is a site whose owner is well identifiable and reachable,

If a site qualifies as "trusted", there's no reason why I shouldn't allow JavaScript, Java or Flash. If some content is annoying, I can disable it with AdBlock.<br />
What I'd like to stress here is that "trust" is not necessarily a technical matter.<br />
Many online banking sites require JavaScript and/or Java, even in contexts where these technologies are absolutely useless and abused:
for more than 2 years I've been asking my bank to correct a <em>very stupid</em> JavaScript bug preventing login from working with Firefox.
I worked around this bug writing an ad hoc bookmarklet, but I'm not sure the average Joe user could.<br />
So, should I trust their mediocre programmers for my security?
Anyway, if something nasty happens with my online bank account because it's unsafe, I'll sue them to death (or better, I'll let the world know) until they refund me.<br />
So you may say <strong>"trustworthy" means "accountable"</strong>.<br />
<a name="siteinfo"></a>
<strong>Starting with version 1.9.9.61, NoScript offers a "<a href="/features#siteinfo">Site Info</a>" page which can help you assess the trustworthiness

If you're more on the technical side and you want to examine the JavaScript source code before allowing, you can help yourself with

Also, if you seek for assistance in the <a href="/forum">NoScript forum</a> and you want to report the sites listed in your menu,
you can easily do it, with no need for typing them, by just right-clicking one item or the menu itself: this will copy the information in the

You may ask, what if site I really trust gets compromised?

you're still safe, with the additional <a href="https://hackademix.net/2008/08/09/heart-touching-thingies/">benefit of an early warning</a> :)</span>

      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
Even if you trust JavaScript to be enabled everywhere (and you shouldn't), you can still use NoScript as an effective annoyance blocker.<br />
To setup this "Annoyance Block" mode, you just need to:
<ol>
<li>
Check <i>NoScript Options|General|<b>Temporarily allow top-level sites by default</b></i>
and select
<i><b>2nd level domain</b></i></li>
<li>Check the <i>NoScript Options|Embeddings|Apply these restrictions to trusted sites as well</i>
preference</li>
</ol>
This way, the main address of each site you visit will be temporarily allowed to run JavaScript
(you may still need to check 3rd party scripts, but they're usually ads and tracking stuff), while the content blocking
restrictions you setup for untrusted sites (<i>NoScript Options|Advanced|Embeddings</i>) will be applied everywhere.<br />
Notice that this setup, even if useful in blocking annoyances and still safer than vanilla Firefox,
is considerably weaker from a security standpoint than the default NoScript configuration.

      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
Well, this is not exactly a <b>frequently</b> asked question, but nevertheless
someone (very few) actually wondered about it...<br />
If you just prefer to restore Firefox's default (less safe) behavior of allowing JavaScript and plugins by default,
but you'd like to retain
Anti-XSS protection and the ability to selectively blacklist sites, you can just click the NoScript icon and select
"<b>Allow Scripts Globally (dangerous)</b>" command.<br />
But if, for some imperscrutable reason, you really want to uninstall, you can proceed as follows:
<ol>
<li>
If you're using <b>Firefox</b>, open the Extension Manager by selecting the <em>Add-ons</em>
item from the "hamburger menu" (formerly <i>Tools|Add-ons</i>) and choosing the <i>Extensions</i> tab.<br />
Highlight the "NoScript" row and click the <b>Uninstall</b> button.<br />
In the rare case it doesn't work, read next points.
</li>
<li>
If your Extension Manager does not open or your extensions are not shown there, your <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder"
target="_blank" title="what is the Mozilla/Firefox profile?"
>Mozilla/Firefox Profile</a>
is probably corrupted:

for NoScript. Actually, is not a supported browser at all. It's too much an old software, it's very flawed and if you're even a bit security
concerned you should get rid immediately of that archaeological item and install an up-to-date browser such as
<a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a>. Anyway, an adventurous user reported he managed to uninstall NoScript from Netscape 7.x
this way:
<ol>
<li>Close your browser gracefully using the Quit or Exit menu (this is important to let it in a consistent, script-enabled state)</li>
<li>Use the search facility of your operative system to find all the files whose name begins with the "noscript" word.</li>
<li>Delete the files you found, cross your fingers and restart your browser</li>

I don't like NoScript redirecting the browser on its release notes page every time I upgrade it. Is there any way to prevent this?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a2_5"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
First time you install NoScript and every time you upgrade it to a newer major version,
Firefox opens an additional tab containing the NoScript welcome page, where you can read the release notes,
the latest announcements and an introduction to the most important NoScript features (plus a link to this very FAQ...)<br />
If you feel you don't need such heads up, you can disable this feature by clicking the NoScript icon, selecting
<em>Options</em> and unchecking "<em>Display the release notes on update</em>" in the "Notifications" tab.
<br />
Notice that if the above "fix" doesn't work or, worse, you keep being redirected on the welcome page every time you restart Firefox,
chances are there's something (like a buggy extension) preventing your preferences from being saved: you may need to
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_Folder#What_do_I_do_if_my_profile_is_corrupted.3F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">follow this advice</a>, then.

      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
NoScript is a security tool, hence its users expect it to take every effort to keep their browsing experience
as safe as it can be, <i>always</i>.<br />
This means that every time a new browser weakness is reported, a new kind of web threat is discovered or a bug is found in NoScript itself
(hey, no software is perfect!), NoScript is <i>immediately</i> updated to react as needed.<br />
<br />
Notice that almost daily "RC" builds for beta testers, containing cosmetic bug fixes or experimental features are available from
<a href="https://noscript.net/getit#devel">https://noscript.net/getit#devel</a> and from the
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/noscript/versions" target="_blank">Beta Channel on <abbr title="addons.mozilla.org">AMO</abbr></a>,
but the updates pushed automatically through the "regular" <abbr title="addons.mozilla.org">AMO</abbr> channel
(for users who are not beta-testers) every 7-10 days are only the "stable" versions,
containing either important security features or major functionality additions.
If at a certain point you installed a "RC" version, but you no longer want to be on the Beta Channel, which gets updated almost daily,
just install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/noscript/" target="_blank">current release version from <abbr title="addons.mozilla.org">AMO</abbr></a>.
<br />
<br />
At any rate, <b>if you want automatic updates to be delivered with a lower frequency</b>,
you can raise the <b>extensions.update.interval</b> <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">about:config</a> preference.<br />
You could also disable NoScript automatic updates by creating a new
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">about:config</a> preference named
<b>extensions.{73a6fe31-595d-460b-a920-fcc0f8843232}.update.enabled</b> and setting it to <b>false</b>.<br />
Furthermore, if you want to <b>completely turn off automatic updates</b> and perform all your upgrades manually whenever you want, you
can simply set the <b>extensions.update.enabled</b> <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">about:config</a>
preference to <b>false</b>.<br />
For users of Firefox 2.x and 3.x, even more control over updates and other aspects of extension management is given by the excellent
<a href="http://www.mrtech.com/extensions/local_install/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MR Tech's Local Install</a> Extension by Mel Reyes.
<br />
Even if you disabled automatic updates, you could still catch up with new releases by subscribing the

I've just upgraded from Firefox 3.6 or Firefox 28, and NoScript icon disappeared or is not where it used to be anymore. What's going on?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a2_7"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
Firefox 4 has removed the so called "Status Bar", i.e. the panel on the bottom of the browser window where most add-ons
(including NoScript) used to place their icons. In place of the Status Bar, Firefox 4 introduced the "<strong>Add-on Bar</strong>", which is a regular toolbar, just placed at the bottom but
<strong>hidden by default</strong>.<br />
For this reason, when you upgrade to Firefox 4 or install NoScript in Firefox 4 and above,
NoScript checks whether the Add-on Bar is hidden or not:
if the Add-on Bar is hidden, NoScript's icon gets moved up to the navigation bar, near the address box, at the top of Firefox's window;
otherwise it stays at the bottom, inside the Add-on Bar.<br />
At any rate, you can drag NoScript's icon wherever you prefer, after right-clicking on any toolbar and selecting "<em>Customize</em>".<br />
<br/ >
Firefox 29 and above have removed the add-on bar as well.  If your NoScript icon was on the add-on bar, it probably got put either on the Navigation bar or somewhere under the 'â¡' button on the right of the toolbar.

Upgrade to most recent stable Firefox version. Firefox up to 1.0.4 was affected by the
2 years old <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217967"
target="_blank">Bug 217967</a> which used to randomly crash the browser after security permissions have been changed.
I fixed it with a patch that was landed in the Mozilla source tree on 30 June 2005, hence Firefox 1.0.5 and above doesn't crash anymore with NoScript :)
<br />
Notice that other crashes happening in buggy plugins as soon as you allow JS on a page, may be wrongly perceived as NoScript related even if they're not.<br />
The most commonly reported are caused by <a href="#qa3_4">Windows Media Player plugin</a>, by the <a href="#qa3_7">Yahoo Application State plugin</a> or by the VLC plugin.
The latter is installed by <a href="http://videolan.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">VLC</a>, a cool audio/video streaming application,
but notwithstanding the VLC coolness (I'm an enthusiast myself), this plugin is behind "Firefox Sudden Death" phenomena (i.e. Firefox abruptly disappear with no error message).
To cure this disease, you need to remove the <i>npvlc.dll</i> from your Firefox plugins folder.

Those services use JavaScript intensively also in subframes and dialogs which not necessarily
have the same URL as the login page. Easiest (even if not safest) thing you can do to fix
your problem is right-clicking on the page, opening the NoScript menu and <i>Allow</i>ing the base domain (i.e. hotmail.com or google.com) rather than the full URL.
The really safest behaviour would be right-clicking on every page which doesn't work and allow one by one
those address entries which are marked as forbidden, starting with the ones apparently more connected with the main site and stopping when the page works.<br />
Some common settings:

This is (was?) a Windows Media Player (WMP) plugin bug, not a NoScript problem.
On some pages, WMP crashes if JavaScript is not enabled.
If you uninstall NoScript but disable JavaScript using the built-in Firefox interface, you get
the very same error. A work-around is keeping WMP disabled on untrusted sites, using

Good news is that this bug <i>seems</i> to be fixed in the

Due to a limitation in Mozilla Suite and SeaMonkey (which lacks the true extensions support introduced with Firefox),
installing an addon which delivers its own XPCOM components (such as FlashGot, NoScript, FoxyTunes, ColorZilla and many others) can be a bit cumbersome.
<br />
You <b>need</b> write access to the Mozilla/SeaMonkey installation directory when you install the extension.
You can either:
<ol>
<li>Start SeaMonkey as root/Administrator and install the package.
When you restart SeaMonkey from your usual account, NoScript will be available to your unprivileged profile as well.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can install a local copy of mozilla in your home directory and use it.
In this case, you can install the extension just once as an unprivileged user because you have write access to the install directory.</li>
</ol>
Firefox doesn't suffer of this problem because XPCOM components are installed in the profile directory (where you always have write permissions).<br />
SeaMonkey versions 2 and above (AKA "Suite Runner") borrow a similar extensions management system.

(That answer does not apply to SeaMonkey 2.x and above.

the <em>Allow 216.xxx.yyy.zzz</em> command you'll find there. Next Yahoo! Mail attachment download will just work.<br />

One of the NoScript keyboard shortcuts overrides a shortcut used by another important extension of mine (e.g. Web Developer). What can I do?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a3_11"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
NoScript keyboard shortcuts have been carefully chosen not to overlap any Firefox built-in function (it's harder than it looks) and also not
to impact with any extension likely to be used by non-technical people.
Notwithstanding, there are literally thousands of Firefox add-ons out there, hence a collision is still possible.
If you see this happening, you can easily reconfigure NoScript's keyboard shortcuts by editing the <i>noscript.keys.*</i> preferences in
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">about:config</a>.<br />
Defaults are:
<ul>
<li><b>noscript.keys.toggle</b>: ctrl shift VK_BACK_SLASH.|</li>
<li><b>noscript.keys.ui</b>: ctrl shift S</li>
<li><b>noscript.keys.tempAllowPage</b>: <i>[no default keyboard shortcut]</i></li>
<li><b>noscript.keys.revokeTemp</b>: <i>[no default keyboard shortcut]</i></li>
</ul>
As you can see, shortcuts are specified as a combination of some modifiers ("ctrl", "shift", "alt") followed by one character (e.g. "A", "1", "Z") or
one virtual keycode (e.g. "VK_BACK_SPACE", "VK_X", "VK_Y"), all space separated.
You can even specify a pair character/virtual keycode (separated by a dot character) to cope with keyboard glitches on different systems
(useful if you use a roaming profile or a portable browser).<br />
Virtual keycodes are listed below for your reference:

      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
As noticed by Mr. T. Logan Scott, the ScrapBook extensions needs (quite oddly) the <i>file://</i> "protocol" to be
whitelisted in NoScript to correctly operate. So, if you absolutely need the ScrapBook extension and until ScrapBook
authors don't work-around this limitation, you have to <i>Allow file://</i>, either from the NoScript menu or the NoScript
Options Dialog.

Why do recent NoScript versions prevent me from using <i>XMLHttpRequest</i> in the Firebug console on untrusted sites?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a3_14"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
Older versions of Firebug uses various hacks to allow JavaScript interactive execution for web developers in the "apparent" context of sites where
JavaScript is otherwise disabled (e.g. by NoScript).
Unfortunately one of these hacks, which allows <i>XMLHttpRequest</i> usage, doesn't work if the <b>noscript.forbidData</b>
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">about:config</a> preference is set to <i>true</i>.
Just toggle it to <i>false</i> and Firebug will fully work again.<br />
Notice that this change doesn't imply any special security weakening, as long as <a href="#xss">XSS protection</a> is kept enabled.<br />
<br />
In current versions of Firebug, its console does not work on pages where JavaScript is disabled.  You need to open the NoScript menu and (Temporarily) allow the main site for it to work.

I get an "Unresponsive Script" message from Firefox on some page or on startup. If I disable NoScript, it doesn't happen. What does it mean?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a3_16"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
The message you're getting is usually related to poor coded JavaScript in web pages.
Under normal circumstances, you should get far <i>less</i> messages like that since you install NoScript (by logic).
However, since Firefox extensions are written in JavaScript too and NoScript doesn't block scripts living outside web pages
(i.e. the browser components, included extensions), if one of them misbehaves you get that message as well.<br />
Now the tricky part: some extensions don't like JavaScript being disabled for web pages. Most of them simply refuse to work, but
a very few enter infinite loops and cause the "Unresponsive Script" message to pop up.<br />
One known offender is the Background Music (BGM) extension.
If you've got it, you may need to choose: music or security?
Otherwise, please use the
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Standard_diagnostic_-_Firefox#Extension_issues" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Standard Diagnostic</a>
procedure to find the culprit.
If you can't isolate a misbehaving extension, you may want to

      <br /><a name="a3_17"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
That's not the ordinary plugin placeholder, but JavaScript links auto-detected on an otherwise empty page or sub-frame

      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
tl;dr If you don't want that, upgrade your <b>very old</b> NoScript to the latest compatible version.<br />
<br />
Starting with version 1.9.2.3, NoScript configure<del>s</del>d a special AdBlock Plus filterset called "NoScript development support filterset",
whitelisting the <b>noscript.net</b>, <b>flashgot.net</b>, <b>informaction.com</b> and <b>hackademix.net</b> web sites, after they were
<a href="http://forums.informaction.com/viewtopic.php?p=2777#p2777">broken by a virulent attack from EasyList</a>
which <strong>crippled even essential features such as links for direct downloads and development builds</strong>.
While EasyList finally mitigated its filters <em>after</em> this whitelist has been publicly released,
<s>keeping the filterset is still useful both to prevent such a breakage from happening again and to give users a chance to support NoScript development
if they don't mind seeing ads on these specific sites.
Should you prefer not to support NoScript development this way, you can just open the AdBlock Plus preferences
and disable the aforementioned filterset with one click.
Since version 1.9.2.5 (released May the 1<sup>st</sup> 2009), NoScript asks you once <strong>beforehand</strong> if you want to keep/install or delete the filterset permanently.

Version 1.9.2.6 (released May the 1<sup>st</sup> 2009) <strong>automatically and permanently removes the filter on startup, no questions asked</strong>.

What is XSS and why should I care?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a4_1"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
XSS stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_site_scripting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Cross site scripting</a>,
a web application vulnerability which allows the attacker to inject malicious code from a certain site into a different site,
and can be used by an attacker to "impersonate" a different user or to steal valuable information.
This kind of vulnerability has clear implications for NoScript users, because if a whitelisted site is vulnerable to a XSS attack,
the attacker can actually run JavaScript code injecting it into the vulnerable site and thus bypassing the whitelist.
That's why NoScript features unique and very effective <a href="features#xss">Anti-XSS protection</a> functionality, which
prevents untrusted sites from injecting JavaScript code into a trusted web page via reflective XSS and makes NoScript's whitelist bullet-proof.

      </div>      <div class="section">
      <a class="faq" name="qa4_2"></a><h4>4.2</h4>
      <span class="QA">Q: &nbsp;</span><b>
Looks like the Anti-XSS feature causes problems with URLs containing some characters such as <b>&lt;</b>, <b>'</b> (single quote) or <b>"</b> (double quotes).
What's happening?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a4_2"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
If you're following a link <i>contained in an <b>not trusted</b> page</i> and leading <i>to a <b>trusted</b> page</i>,
this behaviour is expected by design.
The reason is that those characters can be used to inject malicious code in the destination page, and since the source site is not trusted, "extreme" measures are taken by default.<br />
Possible work-arounds are:
<ol><li><i>Removing the target site from your whitelist</i>. This is usually the best and safest option,
unless the target site absolutely <i>mandates</i> JavaScript, and is also the wisest choice especially for
sites containing user-generated content, e.g. message boards or Wikipedia, because it prevents persistent XSS (also known as "Type 2").
</li>
<li>Clicking the "Options" button and choosing the <i>XSS|<b>Unsafe Reload</b></i> command from the contextual menu, in order to replay the suspicious request skipping sanitization.</li>
<li>(Temporarily) adding the source site to your whitelist. Of course, you should do this only if you (temporarily) trust it, and is
considerably less safe than #1 and #2*</li>
<li>For geeks only, <a href="#xss-exceptions">selectively turning off the Anti-XSS protection</a> for the target page, if you're confident it's immune from XSS attacks.</li>
</ol>
Cross-site requests from a trusted site to a different trusted site are checked through the InjectionChecker engine, which is more accurate
and sanitizes only requests which contain conspicuous fragments of HTML or syntactically valid JavaScript.

If you're a bit of the "geek" type, you know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"
>regular expressions</a> and you're very confident the target web page is immune to XSS vulnerabilities,
you can tweak the <i>NoScript Options|Advanced|XSS|<b>Anti-XSS Protection Exceptions</b></i> rules, i.e. a list of regular expressions (one on each line)
used to identify web addresses which you deem do not need to be protected against XSS.<br />
For instance, the "advanced search" feature on <b>Ebay</b> uses a syntax which is very likely to form syntactically valid JavaScript,
and thus triggers the XSS filters.
If you use this feature often, you may want to copy this line at the bottom of your filter exceptions, paying attention not to add extra spaces:<br />
<code style="line-height: 150%; padding: 4px; background: #eee">^http://[\w\-\.]*\bsearch[\w\-\.]*\.ebay\.(?:com|<strong style="color: #800">de</strong>|<strong style="color: #800">co\.uk</strong>)[\/\?]</code><br />
Notice that "<code><strong style="color: #800">de</strong></code>"
and "<code><strong style="color: #800">co\.uk</strong></code>"
match german and british Ebay respectively:
you will need to add your own country code / top level domain if you

Anyway this feature has been tweaked and fine-tuned over time, and it should be much more usable now, especially after the <em>Blocked objects</em>

Furthermore, since <a href="https://hackademix.net/2008/09/27/clickjacking-and-noscript/" target="_blank">clickjacking</a> became popular,
enabling it is probably a good idea.<br />
Here's how IFRAME blocking works, once enabled from <i>NoScript Options|Embeddings|Forbid IFRAMEs</i>:
<ol>
<li>IFRAMEs embedded in untrusted pages are always blocked, unless they load content from the same site as their parent</li>
<li>IFRAMEs embedded in trusted pages are blocked if they try to load content from untrusted sites</li>
<li>If <i>NoScript Options|Embeddings|Apply these restrictions to trusted sites too</i> is checked, no IFRAME can be loaded unless it loads content from the same site as its parent</li>
<li>In every case, IFRAMEs loading content from the same site as their parent are allowed.*</li>
</ol>
When an IFRAME is blocked, you can see a clickable yellow placeholder which you can use either to examine its URL, save the document without opening it or activate it on the fly.

Notice the leading dot "." before domains, which is syntactic sugar for <strong>site.com *.site.com</strong>, i.e. a domain and its subdomains.
<br />
It should also be noted that, <em>independently from this rule</em>, external scripts are never loaded from pages which don't belong to a
whitelisted site, hence no malicious website you didn't explicitly whitelisted could execute scripts from akamai.net anyway.

Why doesn't the NoScript menu disappear automatically after I allow/forbid one site?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a5_5"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
NoScript 1.8.4 introduced a long awaited enhancement for allowing multiple script sources on the same page at once, called <strong>the "sticky" UI</strong>.
Now if you open the NoScript menu by <em>left clicking</em> on a NoScript icon, or using the <em>ctrl+shift+S</em>
keyboard shortcut, you get the new "sticky" behavior, i.e. you can change multiple permissions without
closing the menu and causing a page refresh. When you're done and ready for reload, you just click outside the menu or hit the <em>Esc</em> key.<br />
You still get the old one-click/one-reload behavior when you open the menu by <em>right clicking</em>.
If you want the old behavior back for left clicks, just toggle the <strong>noscript.stickyUI</strong>
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">about:config</a> preference to false.
You can toggle the <strong>noscript.stickyUI.onKeyboard</strong> preference too if you don't want the keyboard-triggered menu to be sticky.<br />
Another setting you may be interested in is <strong>noscript.stickyUI.liveReload</strong>, which causes quick reloads to happen when you change
each single site even if the menu remains sticky (false by default).

</b>
      <br /><a name="a5_6"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
For security reasons, "all on this page" means every script source which has <em>already been detected on the page and shown in the NoScript menu</em>:
this way you can check in advance what you're whitelisting, even if you're doing it in a single move.
This means, on the other hand, that if a script you've just allowed now tries to dynamically
load another script from a different origin, not seen yet, this new load attempt will be blocked,
so you're given a chance to choose whether allowing it or not. In other words, you need to reiterate
<em>Allow all on this page</em> until no more "surprise" scripts surface after your command has been issued. If
you believe this is too much security for your needs, you can switch on the <em>Advanced|Trusted|Cascade top document's permissions to 3rd party scripts</em> option,
which will automatically allow all the (possibly nested) scripts on pages whose top document address is whitelisted.

What's HTTPS and why is that important for NoScript users?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a6_1"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">HTTPS</a> stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer", and you can figure it as HTTP
(the protocol you usually retrieve web pages with) over a secure encrypted connection.
It is meant to protect you from eavesdroppers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>.
An important feature of HTTPS is that if a web site has a valid digital certificate for its identity, as verified automatically by your browser, you can be reasonably sure
it is the one it says to be. You can recognize HTTPS web sites by looking at their addresses, always beginning with "https://".
Firefox hilights sites having a valid certificate turning part of the location bar to blue or green.
Since NoScript security is largely based on domain names, a malicious party capable of spoofing a trusted site might work-around your whitelist.
This kind of spoofing may happen through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">DNS Hijacking attack</a>
or because you're using an untrusted proxy server, like many anonymizers including <a href="http://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Tor</a>.
The former risk can be mitigated by configuring a static secure DNS, e.g.
<a href="http://www.opendns.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">OpenDNS</a>, and forcing its usage even if you're roaming with your laptop.
Untrusted proxies or connectivity providers are harder to tame, because a man-in-the-middle could inject arbitrary content in any non-secure (non-HTTPS) page.
In order to mitigate these issues, NoScript can be configured to honor your whitelist only if the current page is served through HTTPS, and therefore cannot be spoofed.
Additionally, NoScript can help you forcing your most sensitive sites to always use HTTPS, and

Yes, just open <em>NoScript Options|Advanced|HTTPS|Behavior</em>, entering the sites you want to force in the topmost box,

in the "Force" box and
<pre>www.google.com/search www.google.com/ig</pre>

<a name="cookiemonster"></a>What can NoScript do against HTTPS cookie hijacking?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a6_4"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
HTTPS cookie hijacking happens when a site sets sensitive cookies (e.g. those identifying authenticated sessions) over HTTPS connections but "forgets"
to flag them as "Secure". This means that subsequent unencrypted (non-HTTPS) requests for the same site will leak the session cookies away,
even if you logged in securely.
NoScript provides means to mitigate this issue, configurable in <em>NoScript Options|Advanced|HTTPS|Cookies</em>.
If <strong>Enable Automatic Secure Cookies Management</strong> is checked,
NoScript will try to "patch" insecure cookies set by HTTPS sites on the fly:
<ol>
<li>If the site matches the "<strong>Ignore unsafe cookies...</strong>" pattern list, NoScript lets
its cookies pass through untouched</li>
<li>If the site matches the "<strong>Force encryption for all the cookies...</strong>" pattern list, NoScript appends a
     ";Secure" flag to every non-secure cookie set by this response</li>
<li>Otherwise, NoScript just logs unsafe cookies BUT if no secure cookie
     is set in a HTTPS transaction setting other (unsafe) cookies, NoScript patches all these cookies with ";Secure" like in #2.
     However, if a navigation from an encrypted to a non-encrypted part of the same site (i.e. sharing the same cookies)
     happens in the same tab, NoScript removes its ";Secure" patch to
     ensure compatibility. When it happens, this event is logged to the Error Console, along with a recommendation
     to try forcing HTTPS by listing this site in the <em>HTTPS|Behavior|Force</em> section.
</li>

</b>
      <br /><a name="a6_5"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
Some web sites depend on very complicated domain interrelations and, while they handle sign-on on a certain domain through a secure HTTPS channel,
they need to propagate authentication across multiple domains which do not support HTTPS.
NoScript tries its best to gracefully degrade in these situation which simply cannot be protected,
but some sites are just too complex not to break and login fails.
In this case, you've got two options:
<ol>
<li>If you're in a hurry, disable <em>Automatic Secure Cookie Management</em>, clear your cookies
(at least those for the site you're trying to enter) from Firefox's <em>Options|Privacy|Cookies</em> and retry logging in. It should just work.</li>
<li>
If you've got a few minutes to investigate,
    <ul>
    <li>check your <em>Tools|Web Developer|Browser Console</em> output for lines starting with "<b>[NoScript HTTPS] AUTOMATIC SECURE on https://www.somewebsite.com</b>";</li>
    <li>open <em>NoScript Options|Advanced|HTTPS|Cookies</em> and add "*.somewebsite.com" (without the quotes) to the <em>Ignore unsafe cookies...</em> list;</li>
    <li>Close <em>NoScript Options</em> with "OK", clear your cookies (at least those for somewebsite.com) from Firefox's <em>Options|Privacy|Cookies</em> and try to log in.</li>
    </ul>
If, for instance, you can't login on www.ebay.com, the problem can be fixed adding <strong>*.ebay.com</strong> to <em>NoScript Options|Advanced|HTTPS|Cookies|Ignore unsafe cookies...</em>
and possibly resetting your cookies. If the problem happens on http://twitter.com (notice there's no "www." there),
you'll need to put <strong>.twitter.com</strong> (note the leading ".") to match both the top domain and the subdomains.
 </li>
</ol>
Whatever solution you choose, I'd appreciate you to <a href="https://maone.net/">send me</a> any <em>[NoScript HTTPS]</em> line you may find in <em>Tools|Web Developer|Browser Console</em>

      <span class="QA">Q: &nbsp;</span><b>
What is Clickjacking?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a7_1"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
The word "Clickjacking" has been coined by
<a href="http://ha.ckers.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Robert "RSnake" Hansen</a> and
<a href="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Jeremiah Grossman</a>,
two security researchers (and, incidentally, NoScript users) which back in September 2008 had been prompted by Adobe to withdraw
a speech about this matter because it revealed a critical exploitable flaw in the Flash player.
The concept itself is not new, though, even if there was no previous systematic research.
In facts, with "Clickjacking" we designate a class of attacks (also known as "UI Redressing") which consist in hiding
or disguising an user interface element from a site you trust (e.g. the "Send" button of your webmail site or a pre-configured "Donate" Paypal button)
in a way which leads you to click it without knowledge of what you're exactly doing.
In the impressive proof of concept by RSnake and Jeremiah, you clicked anywhere in their apparently innocuous page, believing you were doing nothing dangerous,
but in reality you were activating your microphone and/or your webcam for Flash access, allowing the remote attacker to spy on you instantaneously.
More in general, an attacker can frame a portion of a certain web page you trust inside a different page under his control,
decontextualizing it or making it transparent: this way he can easily trick you into interacting with it,
and you end to perform a financial transaction or allow him special permissions, without remotely suspecting that something evil is going on.
If JavaScript is allowed on the malicious site, this becomes much easier because the invisible target page can be automatically positioned exactly
under your mouse pointer, so anywhere you clicks the evildoer wins.
However this attack can work even without JavaScript being allowed:
the attacker just needs to trick you into clicking on a seemingly innocuous link or button.
Every web browser is affected, because this attack doesn't rely on any vulnerability or bug which might be fixed overnight:
instead, it exploits very basic and standard web features which are implemented everywhere and are unlikely to be removed any time soon.

If you're not an user of Mozilla Firefox or of another recent Gecko-based web browser,
your pretty much out of luck: you would need to disable plugins and IFrames, which is always impractical and sometimes impossible,
since most browsers have no mean to do it selectively.
<a href="https://hackademix.net/2008/09/29/clickjacking-and-other-browsers-ie-safari-chrome-opera/">Protecting yourself if you're not a Firefox user</a>

the <a href="#clearclick">ClearClick</a> technology.

How does NoScript protect me from Clickjacking / UI-redressing attacks?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a7_3"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
Default protections that NoScript has provided for a long time, i.e. JavaScript and plugin blocking can prevent most clickjacking attacks.
In older version, though, to be 100% protected against Clickjacking you needed to enable the <a href="#iframe">Forbid &lt;IFRAME&gt;</a> and possibly
<a href="/features#contentblocking">Apply these restrictions to trusted sites as well</a> NoScript options.<br />
Fortunately, since <a href="/changelog#1.8.2">version 1.8.2</a>, <strong>NoScript provides a new default kind of protection called
<a href="https://hackademix.net/2008/10/08/hello-clearclick-goodbye-clickjacking/">ClearClick, which defeats clickjacking</a>
<em>no matter if you block frames or not</em>
</strong>. Even better, ClearClick can protect you from Clickjacking / UI-redressing attack <strong>independently from JavaScript and plugins blocking</strong>:
you can even <em>Allow scripts globally</em> (which is not recommended anyway), and your ClearClick still works.

      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
<span id="clearclick">ClearClick is a NoScript specific anti-Clickjacking protection module developed during the September 2008 "Clickjacking panic".</span>
It received testing and feedback from many involved security researches such as RSnake and Jeremiah Grossman (the fathers of the term "Clickjacking"),
Eduardo "Sirdarckcat" Vela and others, and now it's enabled by default, protecting NoScript users from Clickjacking everywhere:
it even remains active if you switch NoScript in the less safe <em>Allow scripts globally</em> mode.
How does it work?
Clickjacking hides or displaces or partially covers something you wouldn't want to click, if you could see it in its original context.
ClearClick does the opposite: whenever you click a plugin object or a framed page, it takes a screenshot of it alone and opaque (i.e. an image of it with no transparencies and no overlaying objects),
then compares it with a screenshot of the parent page as you can see it.
If the two images differ, a clickjacking attack is probably happening and NoScript raises a "ClearClick warning", showing you the contextualized and "clear"
object you were about to click, so you can evaluate by yourself if that was really something you wanted to do.
Of course there are many subtle technical details involved, but the basic concept is just simple like that.

Disabling JavaScript using your browser built-in settings (or the IE's &lt;IFRAME SECURITY="restricted"&gt; feature)
actually disrupts any JavaScript-based anti-Clickjacking protection the target site may have deployed.
The good news is that this limitation does not apply if you use NoScript, thanks to
<strong>Frame Break Emulation</strong>: if a framed page which is not allowed to run JavaScript contains a
âframe bustingâ script, the <em>intention</em> of the page author is honored by NoScript,
i.e. the page replaces the topmost document. You can control this feature toggling the <em>noscript.emulateFrameBreak</em> about:config preference.

Can I use ABE to fine-tune NoScript's permissions?
</b>
      <br /><a name="a8_10"></a>
      <span class="QA">A: &nbsp;</span>
While ABE's main purpose is providing anti-CSRF protection, you can certainly
use it to conditionally block certain HTTP requests depending on their origin and destination URLs,
in order to add more granularity to NoScript's traditional domain-based whitelist.<br />
For instance, you may want to allow scripts from <em>google-analytics.com</em> to be executed on <em>www.friend.com</em> and <em>www.friend2.com</em> but fail on <em>www.foe.com</em> and any other web site.
You can do it by opening <em>NoScript Options|Advanced|ABE</em>, selecting your <em>USER</em> ruleset, and add the following rule in the text box:
<pre>
# google-analytics.com rule
Site .google-analytics.com
# the above is shortcut for google-analytics.com *.google-analytics.com
Accept from .friend.com .friend2.com
Deny
</pre>
Notice that since ABE's rule work independently from NoScript's permissions, <em>you need to "Allow google-analytics.com"</em> in NoScript's menu for the above to work.<br />
Notice also that, independently from ABE, even if a certain script source is whitelisted in NoScript
it won't run as a 3rd party script on pages whose origin is not whitelisted itself.<br />
<br />
You can also use finer grained Deny INCLUSION rules which allow some web sites (e.g. Facebook)
to work and be linked by other web sites, but not to embed iframes, plugins, and scripts (or other kind of inclusions, if you wish) in 3rd party web pages:
<pre>
# facebook containment rule
# This rule allows Facebook scripts objects and frames to be included only
# from Facebook pages and apps
Site ^[0-9A-Za-z-]+://(?:[^/:]+\.)?(?:facebook|fbcdn|insta(?:gram)?|fb[^/:]*-a\.akamaihd)\.[0-9A-Za-z]+[^0-9A-Za-z_\.%-] .fb.me ^https?://fbstatic-[a-z]+\.akamaihd\.net
Accept from SELF+ .facebook.com .fbcdn.net .facebook.net .mafiawars.com .eamobile.com .instagram.com .insta.me .fb.me
Deny INCLUSION
</pre>
Again, you will still need to allow those domains also from NoScript's permissions menu.<br />

<p>NoScript also provides <strong>the most powerful <a href="/features#xss">anti-XSS</a> and <a href="/faq#clearclick">anti-Clickjacking</a> protection</strong> ever available in a browser.

<p>
NoScript's unique <strong>whitelist based pre-emptive script blocking</strong> approach

with no loss of functionality...

<p>
You can enable JavaScript, Java and plugin execution for sites you trust with a simple left-click
on the <a href="/features"><strong>NoScript status bar icon</strong></a> (look at the picture), or
