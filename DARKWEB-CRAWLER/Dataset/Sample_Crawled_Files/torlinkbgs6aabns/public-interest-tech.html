<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As technologyâespecially computer, information, and Internet technologyâpermeates all aspects of our society, people who understand that technology need to be part of public-policy discussions. We need technologists who work in the public interest. We need public-interest technologists.</p>
<p>Defining this term is difficult. One Ford Foundation <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/equals-change-blog/posts/5-reasons-you-might-be-a-public-interest-technologist/">blog post</a> described public-interest technologists as &#8220;technology practitioners who focus on social justice, the common good, and/or the public interest.&#8221; A group of academics in this field wrote that &#8220;public-interest technology refers to the study and application of technology expertise to advance the public interest/generate public benefits/promote the public good.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think of public-interest technologists as people who combine their technological expertise with a public-interest focus, either by working on tech policy, working on a tech project with a public benefit, or working as a more traditional technologist for an organization with a public-interest focus. Public-interest technology isn&#8217;t one thing; it&#8217;s many things. And not everyone likes the term. Maybe it&#8217;s not the most accurate term for what different people do, but it&#8217;s the best umbrella term that covers everyone.</p>
<p>Public-interest technologists are a diverse and interdisciplinary group of people. Their backgrounds are in technology, policy, or law. (This is important, you do not need a computer-science degree to be a public-interest technologist.) They work inside governments, at nongovernmental agencies, for independent research institutions, within for-profit corporations, and for the press. Some of them do this full time as a career. Others take short leaves of absence from their careers to pursue public-interest technology. Still others do this in their spare time, as an avocation.</p>
<p>This is a resources page for public-interest technologists with a public policy focus. As such, it excludes the many tech organizations that are building public-interest tools. (Yes, they&#8217;re important, but they&#8217;re not my focus here.) The lists on this page are not exhaustive, and I am not endorsing or recommending any particular program. This is meant to be a curated sample of the richness of this space, one which I intend to further develop over time. Please e-mail me with corrections, additions, and suggestions &#8212; especially if you are from one of the organizations I list and I mischaracterize you in some important way.</p>
<h2 id="freedman-consulting-documents">Freedman Consulting Documents</h2>
<p>Working under contracts for the Ford Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, and others, Freedman Consulting produced a series of documents broadly discussing the area of public-interest technology. These are good starting points for anyone interested in the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freedman Consulting (2016), &#8220;<a href="https://www.netgainpartnership.org/resources/2018/1/26/a-pivotal-moment">A Pivotal Moment: Developing a New Generation of Technologists for the Public Interest</a>.&#8221; This comprehensive report surveys the current state of the field of public interest technology, and recommends specific interventions needed for it to flourish. It includes a long list of specific interventions.</li>
<li>Freedman Consulting (2018), &#8220;Building the Future: Educating Tomorrow&#8217;s Leaders in an Era of Rapid Technological Change.&#8221; This report summarizes the major academic programs in the US that can broadly classified as public-interest technology. These are generally cross-disciplinary programs, spanning both tech and policy. This report should become public soon.</li>
<li>Freedman Consulting (2018), &#8220;<a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/building-a-new-field-of-public-interest-technology-lessons-learned-from-public-interest-law/">Here to There: Lessons Learned From Public Interest Law</a>.&#8221; This report looks at the development of public-interest law in the 1970s, and draws parallels to public-interest technology today.</li>
<li>Freedman Consulting (2013), &#8220;<a href="https://tfreedmanconsulting.com/reports/a-future-of-failure-the-flow-of-technology-talent-into-government-and-civil-society">A Future of Failure? The Flow of Technology Talent into Government and Civil Society</a>.&#8221; This report investigates the talent pipeline that connects technology experts to careers in government and civil society, and provides an unvarnished assessment of the current state of the pipeline, key challenges and barriers to the development of technology-oriented human capital in government and civil society, models of successful interventions, and recommendations for a more robust pipeline.</li>

</ul>
<p>There are many more organizations that are working in and around this space, but for a variety of reasons don&#8217;t make the cut for this particular resources page.</p>
<p>I want to close with a <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/equals-change-blog/posts/public-interest-tech-a-growing-field-you-should-know/">quote</a> from Michael Brennan, also of the Ford Foundation: &#8220;The field of public interest tech brings people with specific technical expertise into the fight for social change: whether that means ensuring that biased algorithms don&#8217;t further prejudice the criminal justice system, understanding how marginalized communities are negatively impacted by &#8220;smart&#8221; technology, or examining the future of work as artificial intelligence and the gig economy upend the traditional rules of the economy. Since technology affects nearly every aspect of our lives and the world around us, the opportunities for technologists to put their skills to work for the public interest are endless.&#8221;</p>
<p id="endnote"> About that hyphen: Pretty much no one else hyphenates &#8220;public-interest technologist,&#8221; but since &#8220;public interest&#8221; doesn&#8217;t stand alone as a noun it should be there.</p>
