	    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@chrisbuetti/how-i-eat-for-free-in-nyc-using-python-automation-artificial-intelligence-and-instagram-a5ed8a1e2a10">This</a> is a fascinating hack:</p>

<blockquote><p>In today's digital age, a large Instagram audience is considered a valuable currency. I had also heard through the grapevine that I could monetize a large following -- or in my desired case -- use it to have my meals paid for. <i>So I did just that</i>.

<p>I created an Instagram page that showcased pictures of New York City's skylines, iconic spots, elegant skyscrapers Â­-- you name it. The page has amassed a following of over 25,000 users in the NYC area and it's still rapidly growing.</p>

<p>I reach out restaurants in the area either via Instagram's direct messaging or email and offer to post a positive review in return for a free entree or at least a discount. Almost every restaurant I've messaged came back at me with a compensated meal or a gift card. Most places have an allocated marketing budget for these types of things so they were happy to offer me a free dining experience in exchange for a promotion. I've ended up giving some of these meals away to my friends and family because at times I had too many queued up to use myself.</p>

<p>The beauty of this all is that <b>I automated the whole thing</b>. And I mean 100% of it. I wrote code that finds these pictures or videos, makes a caption, adds hashtags, credits where the picture or video comes from, weeds out bad or spammy posts, posts them, follows and unfollows users, likes pictures, monitors my inbox, and most importantly -- both direct messages and emails restaurants about a potential promotion. Since its inception, I haven't even really logged into the account. I spend zero time on it. It's essentially a robot that operates like a human, but the average viewer can't tell the difference. And as the programmer, I get to sit back and admire its (and my) work.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much going on in this project.</p>

	    <p>Yet another side-channel attack on smartphones: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11137">Hearing your touch: A new acoustic side channel on smartphones</a>," by Ilia Shumailov, Laurent Simon, Jeff Yan, and Ross Anderson.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present the first acoustic side-channel attack that recovers what users type on the virtual keyboard of their touch-screen smartphone or tablet. When a user taps the screen with a finger, the tap generates a sound wave that propagates on the screen surface and in the air. We found the device's microphone(s) can recover this wave and "hear" the finger's touch, and the wave's distortions are characteristic of the tap's location on the screen. Hence, by recording audio through the built-in microphone(s), a malicious app can infer text as the user enters it on their device. We evaluate the effectiveness of the attack with 45 participants in a real-world environment on an Android tablet and an Android smartphone. For the tablet, we recover 61% of 200 4-digit PIN-codes within 20 attempts, even if the model is not trained with the victim's data. For the smartphone, we recover 9 words of size 7-13 letters with 50 attempts in a common side-channel attack benchmark. Our results suggest that it not always sufficient to rely on isolation mechanisms such as TrustZone to protect user input. We propose and discuss hardware, operating-system and application-level mechanisms to block this attack more effectively. Mobile devices may need a richer capability model, a more user-friendly notification system for sensor usage and a more thorough evaluation of the information leaked by the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote>

			<h2 class="entry" id="a011998"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/malware_install.html">Malware Installed in Asus Computers through Hacked Update Process</a></h2>
			
		
	
    
	    <p>Kaspersky Labs is <a href="https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/">reporting</a> on a new supply chain attack they call "Shadowhammer."</p>

<blockquote><p>In January 2019, we discovered a sophisticated supply chain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility. The attack took place between June and November 2018 and according to our telemetry, it affected a large number of users. 

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, which were identified by their network adapters' MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses in the trojanized samples and this list was used to identify the actual intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique MAC addresses from over 200 samples used in this attack. Of course, there might be other samples out there with different MAC addresses in their list.</p>

<p>We believe this to be a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses <a href="https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/">the Shadowpad</a> and the <a href="https://blog.avast.com/update-to-the-ccleaner-5.33.6162-security-incident">CCleaner</a> incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed with legitimate certificates (eg: "ASUSTeK Computer Inc."). The malicious updaters were hosted on the official liveupdate01s.asus[.]com and liveupdate01.asus[.]com ASUS update servers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sophistication of the attack leads to the speculation that a nation-state -- and one of the cyber powers -- is responsible.</p>

<p>As I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/05/supply-chain_se.html">previously written</a>, supply chain security is "an incredibly complex problem." These attacks co-opt the very mechanisms we need to trust for our security. And the international nature of our industry results in an array of vulnerabilities that are very hard to secure.</p>

<p>Kim Zetter has a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers">really good article</a> on this.

	    <p>A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-shows-programmers-will-take-the-easy-way-out-and-not-implement-proper-password-security/">university study</a> confirmed the obvious: if you pay a random bunch of freelance programmers a small amount of money to write security software, they're not going to do a very good job at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>In an experiment that involved 43 programmers hired via the Freelancer.com platform, University of Bonn academics have discovered that developers tend to take the easy way out and write code that stores user passwords in an unsafe manner.

<p>For their study, the German academics asked a group of 260 Java programmers to write a user registration system for a fake social network.</p>

<p>Of the 260 developers, only 43 took up the job, which involved using technologies such as Java, JSF, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL to create the user registration component.</p>

<p>Of the 43, academics paid half of the group with â¬100, and the other half with â¬200, to determine if higher pay made a difference in the implementation of password security features.</p>

<p>Further, they divided the developer group a second time, prompting half of the developers to store passwords in a secure manner, and leaving the other half to store passwords in their preferred method -- hence forming four quarters of developers paid â¬100 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P100), developers paid â¬200 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P200), devs paid â¬100 but not prompted for password security (N100), and those paid â¬200 but not prompted for password security (N200).</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't know why anyone would expect this group of people to implement a good secure password system. Look at how they were hired. Look at the scope of the project. Look at what they were paid. I'm sure they grabbed the first thing they found on GitHub that did the job.</p>

<p>I'm not very impressed with the study or its conclusions.</p>

<p>This should come as no surprise. Simson Garfinkel performed the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220900464_Used_Disk_Drives">same</a> <a href="http://static.usenix.org/events/lisa04/tech/talks/garfinkel.pdf">experiment</a> in 2003, with similar results. </p>

	    <p>Not email, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/nyregion/mailbox-theft-fishing.html">paper mail</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thieves, often at night, use string to lower glue-covered rodent traps or bottles coated with an adhesive down the chute of a sidewalk mailbox. This bait attaches to the envelopes inside, and the fish in this case -- mail containing gift cards, money orders or checks, which can be altered with chemicals and cashed -- are reeled out slowly.</p></blockquote>

<p>In response, the US Post Office is introducing a more secure mailbox:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mail slots are only large enough for letters, meaning sending even small packages will require a trip to the post office. The opening is also equipped with a mechanism that grabs at a letter once inserted, making it difficult to retract.</p></blockquote>

<p>The crime has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/nyregion/new-york-ny-mailbox-theft.html">more common</a> in the past few years.</p>

	    <p>From the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/science/squid-camouflage-colors.html">New York Times</a></i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08891-x">a paper published last week in Nature Communications</a> suggests that their chromatophores, previously thought to be mainly pockets of pigment embedded in their skin, are also equipped with tiny reflectors made of proteins. These reflectors aid the squid to produce such a wide array of colors, including iridescent greens and blues, within a second of passing in front of a new background. The research reveals that by using tricks found in other parts of the animal kingdom -- like shimmering butterflies and peacocks -- squid are able to combine multiple approaches to produce their vivid camouflage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Researchers studied Doryteuthis pealeii, or the longfin squid.</p>

<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven't covered.</p>

	    <p>Sometimes it seems like the people in charge of homeland security spend too much time watching action movies. They defend against specific movie plots instead of against the broad threats of terrorism.</p>
<p>We all do it. Our imaginations run wild with detailed and specific threats. We imagine anthrax spread from crop dusters. Or a contaminated milk supply. Or terrorist scuba divers armed with almanacs. Before long, we're envisioning an entire movie plot, without Bruce Willis saving the day. And we're scared.</p>
<p>Psychologically, this all makes sense. Humans have good imaginations. Box cutters and shoe bombs conjure vivid mental images. "We must protect the Super Bowl" packs more emotional punch than the vague "we should defend ourselves against terrorism."</p>
<p>The 9/11 terrorists used small pointy things to take over airplanes, so we ban small pointy things from airplanes. Richard Reid tried to hide a bomb in his shoes, so now we all have to take off our shoes. Recently, the Department of Homeland Security said that it might relax airplane security rules. It's not that there's a lessened risk of shoes, or that small pointy things are suddenly less dangerous. It's that those movie plots no longer capture the imagination like they did in the months after 9/11, and everyone is beginning to see how silly (or pointless) they always were.</p>
<p>Commuter terrorism is the new movie plot. The London bombers carried bombs into the subway, so now we search people entering the subways. They used cell phones, so we're talking about ways to shut down the cell-phone network.</p>
<p>It's too early to tell if hurricanes are the next movie-plot threat that captures the imagination.</p>
<p>The problem with movie plot security is that it only works if we guess right. If we spend billions defending our subways, and the terrorists bomb a bus, we've wasted our money. To be sure, defending the subways makes commuting safer. But focusing on subways also has the effect of shifting attacks toward less-defended targets, and the result is that we're no safer overall.</p>
<p>Terrorists don't care if they blow up subways, buses, stadiums, theaters, restaurants, nightclubs, schools, churches, crowded markets or busy intersections. Reasonable arguments can be made that some targets are more attractive than others: airplanes because a small bomb can result in the death of everyone aboard, monuments because of their national significance, national events because of television coverage, and transportation because most people commute daily. But the United States is a big country; we can't defend everything.</p>
<p>One problem is that our nation's leaders are giving us what we want. Party affiliation notwithstanding, appearing tough on terrorism is important. Voting for missile defense makes for better campaigning than increasing intelligence funding. Elected officials want to do something visible, even if it turns out to be ineffective.</p>
<p>The other problem is that many security decisions are made at too low a level. The decision to turn off cell phones in some tunnels was made by those in charge of the tunnels. Even if terrorists then bomb a different tunnel elsewhere in the country, that person did his job.</p>
<p>And anyone in charge of security knows that he'll be judged in hindsight. If the next terrorist attack targets a chemical plant, we'll demand to know why more wasn't done to protect chemical plants. If it targets schoolchildren, we'll demand to know why that threat was ignored. We won't accept "we didn't know the target" as an answer. Defending particular targets protects reputations and careers.</p>
<p>We need to defend against the broad threat of terrorism, not against specific movie plots. Security is most effective when it doesn't make arbitrary assumptions about the next terrorist act. We need to spend more money on intelligence and investigation: identifying the terrorists themselves, cutting off their funding, and stopping them regardless of what their plans are. We need to spend more money on emergency response: lessening the impact of a terrorist attack, regardless of what it is. And we need to face the geopolitical consequences of our foreign policy and how it helps or hinders terrorism.</p>
<p>These vague things are less visible, and don't make for good political grandstanding. But they will make us safer. Throwing money at this year's movie plot threat won't.</p>

	    <p>Yet another side-channel attack on smartphones: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11137">Hearing your touch: A new acoustic side channel on smartphones</a>," by Ilia Shumailov, Laurent Simon, Jeff Yan, and Ross Anderson.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present the first acoustic side-channel attack that recovers what users type on the virtual keyboard of their touch-screen smartphone or tablet. When a user taps the screen with a finger, the tap generates a sound wave that propagates on the screen surface and in the air. We found the device's microphone(s) can recover this wave and "hear" the finger's touch, and the wave's distortions are characteristic of the tap's location on the screen. Hence, by recording audio through the built-in microphone(s), a malicious app can infer text as the user enters it on their device. We evaluate the effectiveness of the attack with 45 participants in a real-world environment on an Android tablet and an Android smartphone. For the tablet, we recover 61% of 200 4-digit PIN-codes within 20 attempts, even if the model is not trained with the victim's data. For the smartphone, we recover 9 words of size 7-13 letters with 50 attempts in a common side-channel attack benchmark. Our results suggest that it not always sufficient to rely on isolation mechanisms such as TrustZone to protect user input. We propose and discuss hardware, operating-system and application-level mechanisms to block this attack more effectively. Mobile devices may need a richer capability model, a more user-friendly notification system for sensor usage and a more thorough evaluation of the information leaked by the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The police are increasingly <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/reverse-location-search-warrants-google-police.html">getting search warrants</a> for information about all cell phones in a certain location at a certain time:</p>

<blockquote><p>Police departments across the country have been knocking at Google's door for at least the last two years with warrants to tap into the company's extensive stores of cellphone location data. Known as "reverse location search warrants," these legal mandates allow law enforcement to sweep up the coordinates and movements of every cellphone in a broad area. The police can then check to see if any of the phones came close to the crime scene. In doing so, however, the police can end up not only fishing for a suspect, but also gathering the location data of potentially hundreds (or thousands) of innocent people. There have only been anecdotal reports of reverse location searches, so it's unclear how widespread the practice is, but privacy advocates worry that Google's data will eventually allow more and more departments to conduct indiscriminate searches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it's not just Google who can provide this information.</p>

<p>I am also reminded of a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csec-used-airport-wi-fi-to-track-canadian-travellers-edward-snowden-documents-1.2517881">Canadian</a> <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news2/pdf/airports_redacted.pdf">surveillance program</a> disclosed by Snowden.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time talking about this sort of thing in <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/data_and_goliath/"><i>Data and Goliath</i></a>. Once you have everyone under surveillance all the time, many things are possible.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (3/13): <a href="https://lers.google.com/signup_v2/landing">Here'</a> the portal law enforcement uses to make its requests.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011905"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/01/security_vulner_19.html">Security Vulnerabilities in Cell Phone Systems</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Good <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/opinion/cellphones-security-spying.html">essay</a> on the inherent vulnerabilities in the cell phone standards and the market barriers to fixing them.</p>

<blockquote><p>So far, industry and policymakers have largely dragged their feet when it comes to blocking cell-site simulators and SS7 attacks. Senator Ron Wyden, one of the few lawmakers vocal about this issue, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/24/fbi-surveillance-devices-may-interfere-with-calls-us-senator-says/">sent a letter in August</a> encouraging the Department of Justice to "be forthright with federal courts about the disruptive nature of cell-site simulators." No response has ever been published.

<p>The lack of action could be because it is a big task -- there are hundreds of companies and international bodies involved in the cellular network. The other reason could be that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have a vested interest in exploiting these same vulnerabilities. But law enforcement has other effective tools that are unavailable to criminals and spies. For example, the police can work directly with phone companies, serving warrants and Title III wiretap orders. In the end, eliminating these vulnerabilities is just as valuable for law enforcement as it is for everyone else.</p>

<p>As it stands, there is no government agency that has the power, funding and mission to fix the problems. Large companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Google and Apple have not been public about their efforts, if any exist.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>It's amazing that this is even possible: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10250">SonarSnoop: Active Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We report the first active acoustic side-channel attack. Speakers are used to emit human inaudible acoustic signals and the echo is recorded via microphones, turning the acoustic system of a smart phone into a sonar system. The echo signal can be used to profile user interaction with the device. For example, a victim's finger movements can be inferred to steal Android phone unlock patterns. In our empirical study, the number of candidate unlock patterns that an attacker must try to authenticate herself to a Samsung S4 Android phone can be reduced by up to 70% using this novel acoustic side-channel. Our approach can be easily applied to other application scenarios and device types. Overall, our work highlights a new family of security threats.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Recently, Apple introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/07/apple-releases-ios-11-4-1-tvos-11-4-1-homepod-11-4-1-and-watchos-4-3-2/">restricted mode</a> to protect iPhones from attacks by companies like <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/02/cellebrite_unlo.html">Cellebrite</a> and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/02/cellebrite_unlo.html">Greyshift</a>, which allow attackers to recover information from a phone without the password or fingerprint. Elcomsoft <a href="https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2018/07/this-9-device-can-defeat-ios-usb-restricted-mode/">just announced</a> that it can easily bypass it.</p>

<p>There is an important lesson in this: security is hard. Apple Computer has one of the best security teams on the planet. This feature was not tossed out in a day; it was designed and implemented with a lot of thought and care. If this team could make a mistake like this, imagine how bad a security feature is when implemented by a team without this kind of expertise.</p>

<p>This is the reason actual cryptographers and security engineers are very skeptical when a random company announces that their product is "secure." We know that they don't have the requisite security expertise to design and implement security properly. We know they didn't take the time and care. We know that their engineers think they understand security, and designed to a level that <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html">they couldn't break</a>.</p>

<p>Getting security right is hard for the best teams on the world. It's impossible for average teams.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://m.phys.org/news/2018-06-gaps-lte-mobile-telephony-standard.html">Interesting</a> <a href="https://alter-attack.net/">research</a> in using traffic analysis to learn things about encrypted traffic. It's hard to know how critical these vulnerabilities are. They're very hard to close without wasting a huge amount of bandwidth.</p>

<p>The active attacks are more interesting.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (7/3): More <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/lte-wireless-connections-used-by-billions-arent-as-secure-as-we-thought/">information</a>.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about this, and now believe the attacks are more serious than I previously wrote.</p>

	    <p>Russia has <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/russia-blocks-telegram-backdoor-access,36881.html">banned</a> the secure messaging app Telegram.  It's making an <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180417/13133139649/trying-to-ban-telegram-russia-breaks-internet.shtml">absolute mess of the ban</a> -- blocking <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17246150/telegram-russia-ban">16 million IP addresses</a>, many belonging to the Amazon and Google clouds -- and it's not even clear that it's working. But, more importantly, I'm not convinced Telegram is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-right-now-1782557415">secure in the first place</a>.</p>

<p>Such a weird story. If you want secure messaging, use Signal. If you're concerned that having Signal on your phone will itself arouse suspicion, use WhatsApp.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/2018/03/graykey-iphone-unlocker-poses-serious-security-concerns/">Some details</a> about the iPhone unlocker from the US company Greyshift, with photos.</p>

<blockquote><p>Little is known about Grayshift or its sales model at this point. We don't know whether sales are limited to US law enforcement, or if it is also selling in other parts of the world. Regardless of that, it's highly likely that these devices will ultimately end up in the hands of agents of an oppressive regime, whether directly from Grayshift or indirectly through the black market.

<p>It's also entirely possible, based on the history of the IP-Box, that Grayshift devices will end up being available to anyone who wants them and can find a way to purchase them, perhaps by being reverse-engineered and reproduced by an enterprising hacker, then sold for a couple hundred bucks on eBay.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011482"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/02/cellebrite_unlo.html">Cellebrite Unlocks iPhones for the US Government</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p><i>Forbes</i> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/02/26/government-can-access-any-apple-iphone-cellebrite/#6d79f1a9667a">reports</a> that the Israeli company Cellebrite can probably unlock all iPhone models:</p>

<blockquote><p>Cellebrite, a Petah Tikva, Israel-based vendor that's become the U.S. government's company of choice when it comes to unlocking mobile devices, is this month telling customers its engineers currently have the ability to get around the security of devices running iOS 11. That includes the iPhone X, a model that <i>Forbes</i> has learned was successfully raided for data by the Department for Homeland Security back in November 2017, most likely with Cellebrite technology.

<p>[...]</p>

<p>It also appears the feds have already tried out Cellebrite tech on the most recent Apple handset, the iPhone X. That's according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4386077-iPhone-X-Cellebrite-Extraction.html">warrant</a> unearthed by <i>Forbes</i> in Michigan, marking the first known government inspection of the bleeding edge smartphone in a criminal investigation. The warrant detailed a probe into Abdulmajid Saidi, a suspect in an arms trafficking case, whose iPhone X was taken from him as he was about to leave America for Beirut, Lebanon, on November 20. The device was sent to a Cellebrite specialist at the DHS Homeland Security Investigations Grand Rapids labs and the data extracted on December 5.</p></blockquote>

<p>This story is based on some excellent reporting, but leaves a lot of questions unanswered. We don't know exactly what was extracted from any of the phones. Was it metadata or data, and what kind of metadata or data was it.</p>

<p>The story I hear is that Cellebrite hires ex-Apple engineers and moves them to countries where Apple can't prosecute them under the DMCA or its equivalents. There's also a credible rumor that Cellebrite's mechanisms only defeat the mechanism that limits the number of password attempts. It does not allow engineers to move the encrypted data off the phone and run an offline password cracker. If this is true, then strong passwords are still secure.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (3/1): Another <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/cellebrite-can-unlock-any-iphone-for-some-values-of-any/">article</a>, with more information. It looks like there's an arms race going on between Apple and Cellebrite. At least, if Cellebrite is telling the truth -- which they may or may not be.</p>

	    <p>From the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/science/squid-camouflage-colors.html">New York Times</a></i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08891-x">a paper published last week in Nature Communications</a> suggests that their chromatophores, previously thought to be mainly pockets of pigment embedded in their skin, are also equipped with tiny reflectors made of proteins. These reflectors aid the squid to produce such a wide array of colors, including iridescent greens and blues, within a second of passing in front of a new background. The research reveals that by using tricks found in other parts of the animal kingdom -- like shimmering butterflies and peacocks -- squid are able to combine multiple approaches to produce their vivid camouflage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Researchers studied Doryteuthis pealeii, or the longfin squid.</p>

<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven't covered.</p>

<p>Has anyone demonstrated a display that uses a mechanism like butterfly âstructuralâ color, i.e.  interference effects of light passing through and reflecting in the (controllable) gap between multiple surfaces ? Might offer low power and strong color obtained from ambient light, without the âstaring into a lightbulbâ effect of screen illumination by backing light.</p>

</p>
<p>For some months I have been mystified by the recent spate of newsworthy discoveries that some important corporation has made the mistake of keeping unencrypted files of user passwords. The mystery, of course, is not the complete obviousness of how bad that is, nor how easy it is to do better; rather, it is the complete idiocy of making such a mistake, and its prevalance among corporations that do not seem in all cases to be staffed entirely by idiots.</p>

<p>(I am ready to see corrections on the question of just how bad this is, and would be interested in the opinions of actual experts. I here omit my anecdotal evidence of its obviousness.)</p>

<p>The NYT piece by Brian X Chen on the Facebook security scandal of the day seems to imply an answer, deliberately or not, but does not carry it to its logical conclusion. The key passage: "Citing a Facebook insider, Mr. Krebs said access records revealed that 2,000 engineers or developers had made nine million queries for data that included plain-text user passwords." Please note the "or developers", and wonder whether they are all internal to Facebook.<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/technology/personaltech/facebook-passwords.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/technology/personaltech/facebook-passwords.html</a></p>

<p>A possible conclusion: the information was not kept securely because it was never intended to be secure. Much more convenient and profitable to let all the users' data leak to any of the 2,000 people who had access and the skills to make applications for selling everyone's private data. </p>

<p>I am curious whether this answer has been so obvious all along that no one has bothered to mention it, or it has been overlooked everywhere. The former seems unwise, since somewhere there is a congressperson with a at least an average IQ and the ability to follow the argument if it were presented - and the temperament to make a noise about it. The latter seems unlikely on the grounds of "If I can figure this out..."</p>

<p>Then again, there is the third possiblity, that I've got it all wrong. Ridiculous, of course?<br />

<p>@Porlock Junior</p>

<p>I agree entirely. While I consider the idiom "do not ascribe to malice that which can be explained by incompetence", you do not get to be the world's largest social media company by accident.</p>

<p>9 million queries? Why? Did they doubt their implementation of a hash function that much that they needed to test "edge-cases" using live data? I doubt it.</p>

<p>That surely leaves only one inescapable conclusion?</p>

<article><div class="comment by-gordo" id="c6790462">

</p>
<p>From the Krebs' article:</p>

<blockquote>The Facebook source said the investigation so far indicates between 200 million and 600 million Facebook users may have had their account passwords stored in plain text and searchable by more than 20,000 Facebook employees. The source said Facebook is still trying to determine how many passwords were exposed and for how long, but so far the inquiry has uncovered archives with plain text user passwords dating back to 2012.</blockquote>

<p>This may be a coincidence, but Facebook's pivot to mobile began in 2012.</p>

<p><b>Thoughts on the B737 Airliner Scandal</b></p>

<p>Though this blog and its comments usually focus on malicious intervention, I suggest that "automation gone wrong" is another important aspect of security, the hazards of which grow steadily.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>Without delving into aerodynamics, it's important to understand that airliners have two systems to control pitch (the angle of the nose relative to the horizon).  Elevator control is:<br />
â¢ rapid<br />
â¢ controlled by hand motions on a lever ("analog" input)<br />
â¢ limited in pitch effect</p>

<p>whereas stabilizer control is:<br />
â¢ slow<br />
â¢ controlled by switches ("binary" input)<br />
â¢ several times more effective than elevators</p>

<p>The difference in effect is crucial: the elevators used for maneuvering have the capacity to keep the plane in controlled flight if, and only if, the stabilizer position is in the right general neighborhood.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>What is believed to have happened in the Lion Air crash, and likely to have been repeated in the recent Ethiopian crash, is that an automatic function called MCAS (intended, ironically, for safety) made a series of stabilizer adjustments which eventually drove the planes downward even with full nose-up elevator position.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>There are several aspects to the safety breakdown which apparently occurred on these planes, including:<br />
â¢ design of the MCAS system<br />
â¢ coverage (or omission) in flight manuals<br />
â¢ flight crew training<br />
â¢ flight crew proficiency<br />
â¢ deficient certification (regulatory) process</p>

<p>Although there were almost surely opportunities for flight crews to save these situations, the seeming failures to respond effectively were themselves (in my opinion) aggravated by the automation design.</p>

<p>Note: It seems that on at least a few occasions, the same type of MCAS malfunction occurred without accident because flight crews responded timely.<br />

<p>To give one example of how MCAS design was dangerous: a much older safety system affecting pitch control (often called a "stick pusher") literally exerts a quite strong force on the yoke in the pilot's hands (at least, when not in autopilot).</p>

<p>This design (more than half a century old) had two great safety advantages:  first, the pilot would immediately feel the effect of the system intervention; and second, the pilot could immediately override the intervention (if s/he judged it inappropriate) by physically pulling on the yoke and overpowering the "pusher."  It's a sort of "right-brain" remedy.</p>

<p>By contrast, MCAS adjusts the stabilizer without making any noise other tactile/auditory signal (at least, as far as I have been able to learn).  When MCAS engages inappropriately, pilots must puzzle out why the plane is responding abnormally, process visual inputs in the cockpit, and reason through a "left-brain" process in order to diagnose the problem and respond effectively.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>The existing MCAS design bases its actions on values measured from one type of "air data" sensor on the aircraft.  The present hypothesis is that the observed MCAS anomalies occur when this angle-of-attack sensor malfunctions.</p>

<p>In essence, the MCAS makes correct responses to a false assessment of the aircraft state.  Obviously, the system design has (in effect) a single-point-of-failure vulnerability.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>Reports of a Boeing internal assessment of MCAS problems disclose several significant findings:</p>

<p>1. The actual MCAS range of pitch adjustment is about 4 times as great as the range on which the Boeing safety analysis was based.</p>

<p>2. The analysis was based on a single incorrect pitch adjustment by MCAS, and failed to account for a scenario in which after a while MCAS would effectively reset, and iteratively repeat the incorrect adjustment, leading to cumulatively large stabilizer mispositioning.</p>

<p>3. At the assessed level of criticality for MCAS, its design should not have relied on a single type of sensor as input.</p>

<p>@MarkH...</p>

<p>Nice summary, thanks...</p>

<p>The 737 MAX has a design flaw, wherein the airplaneâs center of gravity is permanently unstable. The larger, more fuel efficient engines are moved closer to fuselage. In addition, to meet ground clearance requirements, the engines are moved forward and higher on the wings. The article below explains this pretty well:</p>

<p>h**ps://graphics.reuters.com/ETHIOPIA-AIRLINE-CONTROLS/0100916V1NZ/index.html</p>

<p>The end result is a plane, that can stall, in another word lose lift. The MCAS is intended to keep the plane in balance to prevent stalling.</p>

<p>The end result, with all of its faults, is clearly on BOEING and to a certain extent on the FAA. In 2005, FAA changed how the airplanes are certified by allowing BOEING and others to certify their own planes. The FAA had been relegated to review and approve the manufacturer's documentation. The 737 MAX had been the first airplane that had been approved by FAA based on the new certification process, in 2012 or 2013.</p>

<p>The optional "security add on" included warning light for malfunctioning sensor and MCAS. Like most "add-on", it's an additional cost for airlines that some of them did not opt for. The main reason being, that they did not know much about the impact of the MCAS and unfortunately, neither did some of the pilots.</p>

<p>While BOEING and FAA are responsible for the end results, the pilots are not entirely innocent either. It's hard to understand how pilots would not learn the in and out of the new airplane and it's controls. The lack of appropiate training is part of it, but if you are a pilot, it isn't just the passengers on the plane whose life is at risk. The life of the pilot is at risk too.</p>

<p>Automation going haywire is a fact of life everywhere, it isn't necessarily the fault of automation. Humans are just as much at fault for not knowing how to correct the faulty automation at hand.   </p>

<p>@MarkH, Ergo Sum:<br />
Boeing was clearly aware of those problems, but they heavily underestimated them. They even had the "AOA disagree" system, but it was optional as it was the pilot training. <br />
I am sure that if the pilots did have the proper training they would have handled the situation. It's not the first time that faulty (or even working as intended for that matter) automation combined with lack of pilot training led to accidents, and unfortunately it won't be the last ... Not to mention most flights are fully automated and most pilots don't really know how to fly "manually" or how to react if the automation fails. <br />
Now the "AOA disagree" warning system will be default instead of optional, and pilot training will be mandatory. Too late for the 300+ souls though ... </p>

<p>The design flaw in the MAX is that it requires any flesh and blood pilot at all. Stop trying to train around human limitations and let the software do all the work--safer, faster, cheaper. </p>

<p>Boeings mistake was that it wanted to offload some flight deck responsibility to the children of the magenta line. Unsurprsingly, some of them biffed their task. Plane crashes. </p>

Pilots can't learn something if they don't know they are supposed to learn it. As i said, it was an overlooked piece of hardware/software. They heavily underestimated the MACS importance, after all it wasn't a system that controls the toilet lights, but a critical system in aircraft maneuvering. To fly a commercial airliner you need a type rating that's not easy to get nor cheap. It's not like you can buy or rent a 737 MAX and play with it. If more importance would have been given to the MACS system it would have made a huge difference.</p>

<p>@Bob Paddock:</p>

<p>"doesn't that mean that any moving mass, even if optically cloaked or undersea like a Sub, would be detectable?"</p>

<p>Yes and no, you have the single-v-multi sensor issue.</p>

<p>Put simply untill recently you detect mass by it's effect on other mass, part of that is the distance between the two masses. If you have your sensor mass indicating a 'mass at a distance' then the distant object can trade mass with distance from the sensor mass and it would not detect any change.</p>

<p>Thus with rockets for instance with most of their mass being fuel it might be possible to design it so that a war head could get in effective range before there is any significant mass movement directly to wards the sensor mass detected.</p>

<p>You have similar issues with passive range detectors that use just signal strength. If the transmitter knows where the range detector is it can change it's signal output level accordingly. It can also easily fake the Doppler shift for a single sensor as well.</p>

<p>It's why you should always have a long base line approximately orthagonal to the target with multiple sensors and move atleast one of them in an apparently random manner known only to the sensor operator.</p>

<p>Whilst it might appear academic you can turn things on their head. If your drone only has one GPS antenna then it's vulnerable to a form of fairly simple spoofing attack. Where you pick up the signals at a remote antenna and rebroadcast them at the drone, if your signal is stronger at the drone then you win. It's a little bit more complicated but in essence thats what you do.</p>

<p>@Sherman Jerrold re: FEMA breach - Just want to point out that most decisions in Federal bureaucracies are made by career bureaucrats whose tenure span multiple political administrations. With some exceptions, policies with respect to such criteria as security of data are also evolved and administered over the long term. As much as I despise Trump & co, I think it would be a mistake to attribute the dysfunction of FEMA in general, and the lack of planning and diligence leading to this breach specifically, too predominately to the current administration. That might be emotionally satisfying, to an extent, but inaccurate attribution will tend to hinder solutions more than to promote them.</p>

<p>@James re: 737 MAX "Not to mention most flights are fully automated and most pilots don't really know how to fly "manually" or how to react if the automation fails."<br />
This to me is a huge problem in and of itself. The first question that occurred to me as I read of these crashes was of how bad an aircraft design could be for its designers to believe that pilots were incompetent to correct likely flight anomalies, and that the corrections should be taken entirely out of their hands. I'm sorry to say that your statement rings true in that regard. Automated systems will sometimes fail; critical automated systems will sometimes fail catastrophically. Automated systems require human monitoring at some remove (the degree is certainly subject to debate.) To just flat out ignore that need in the interest of development resource economies is, and will continue to be, a recipe for disaster(s) I expect similar outcomes if (when?) US DOT begins allowing autonomous vehicles to share highways with human driven conveyances without sufficient testing with a human present and capable of overriding mistakes. At least the per incident carnage in those cases should be smaller in magnitude.</p>

<p>@VinnyG:<br />
I don't think the 737 MAX is actually flawed by design (just an opinion, i only have a PPL-A SEP, hobby license, what we're talking about here is on a whole different level). The fact they did not change the training to include this particular system is outright stupid, especially since (from what i have been reading) some pilots did complain. Allowing a single point of failure (one AOA sensor) for a critical system is also stupid.<br />
Take the B2 Spirit for example, the available public info, it's impossible to fly that plane by hand. Most critical systems are handeled by computers. But at a 2Bn price tag, i bet those pilots know every nut and bolt on that plane. <br />
It's not the first time a piece of automation designed to save your live ends up killing you, unfortunately it won't be the last ... </p>

</p>
<p>@Humdee: Let's agree to disagree. Remember that all our tech is made by humans. Indeed human error accounts for the better part of accidents. However, if you break that down, human error not always equals pilot error. Remember, automation is also made by humans. If a pilot fails, he crashes his flight. If an engineer fails, he crashes several flights, until the investigators catch up on the flaw. Most of the times an air crash is not caused by one single failure, but by a cascade of failures, human, mechanical, logistical or otherwise. It's a system strong as it's weakest link. You could conclude that the 737 MAX fiasco is technically human error, but not really pilot error. Human pilots saved the day on several occasions, they complained to the airlines "hey, this bird is doing something it wasn't supposed to do, and that isn't in the SOP" and they were ignored. Human error indeed, but not pilot error, until proven otherwise. I agree in our day is illogical to hold the yoke in your hand for a transatlantic flight when an automated system can hold your track / FL / etc, however i want a trained pilot in that cockpit not a computer. </p>

<p>@Humdee:</p>

<p>"Pilot error is the #1 cause of airline incidents reported to the FAA."</p>

<p>I'm aleays cautious of 'pilot error' when the person is not there to defend themselves, especially when auto pilots are involved.</p>

<p>Often it is easier to blaim the pilot than say we have to little evidence of what actually went wrong.</p>

<p>In the UK some years ago a Chinook helicopter flew into the ground in scotland when carrying quite a few anti-terrorism experts. The military enquirey was decidely deficient and the pilots who were dead were blaimed. A group of people carried out their own investigation and showed the enquiry to be the travisty it was. Eventually the military had to climb down and admit that actually the most likely cause was not pilot error but as the result of a software upgrade.</p>

<p>This prompted others to make their own investigations and an inyetesting statistic came to light. The likely hood of a pilot being blaimed was quite a bit different if the pilot was a survivour.</p>

<p>So I'd treat the pilot error findings when the pilots are dead as being a 'lift the corner of the carpet' excercise on behalf of those investigating.</p>

<p>That said I've long believed that automated systems are both more consistant and more reliable than humans.</p>

<p>The problem is that automated systems lack much of the awarness an alert and experienced pilot has when it comes to any one of a million or so errors. The engineers who design those systems work with 'what is known' not what is unknown. Thus any new type of failure is going to be unknown to the system and stay that way untill the software goes through an update, extensive testing and an eventually slow roll out around the world. This leaves a large window in which things can further go wrong.</p>

<p>But yes like you I want to get the pilot out of the airplane, but only when the system is sufficient, which currently they are for uneventful flights but the eventful flights no not yet not by quite some way.<br />

<p>@Ergo Sum:</p>

<p>Thanks for the link to the explainer, which is done quite well (as usual for Reuters).  I see that these planes still have trim wheels, so I stand corrected that stabilizer controls are only binary -- the switches on the control yokes are simply up/down, but the trim wheels are "analog style."</p>

<p>I would not say that the engine configuration change on the MAX introduced instability ... "unstable" has a quite specific meaning in aviation.  Rather, I would call it an unusual handling characteristic.</p>

<p>Aviation has a long history of automatic systems to counteract both tricky handling characteristics (which I believe exist in one form or another on all airliners), and actual instability.  Until now, these were designed in thoughtful ways that minimize any trouble to the flight crew.<br />
_______________________________</p>

<p>The beginning of the Reuters article explains how "yoke jerk" shut off the automatic trim system in older 737s.  This is a great example of the old Boeing design philosophy: the pilot's natural and intuitive response to aircraft misbehavior disables the automatic system.<br />
_______________________________</p>

<p>My interest in this type of aviation accident dates back to the early days of Airbus super-tech airliner design, when I read an account of a fatal crash which occurred (as I recall) in Asia.</p>

<p>In that case, the flight crew had accidentally set the "mode" of their highly automated plane for takeoff, when in fact they were in the landing phase.</p>

<p>The Airbus automatic control system kept winding in nose-up stabilizer, in response its observation of descent when it expected to ascend.  The pilots reacted by pushing their joysticks forward, in an effort to keep the nose down.  This continued until the stabilizer angle was so great that even with full down elevator, the jet stalled and crashed.</p>

<p>In Boeing designs of that era, the pilots' assertive control inputs would have switched off automatic trim ... but in the Airbus, the pilots needed to understand that automatic trim was the cause of their troubles, and then push a button to disable automatic trim.</p>

<p>I was horrified by this vision of the doomed aircrew in a losing battle with an automated system <i>which was fighting against them.</i></p>

<p>My takeaway, was to <i><b>NEVER</b></i> allow automation to wage an extended tug-of-war against the human pilots.  [Another example of getting this wrong was Toyota effectively preventing drivers from shutting off the engine in response to stuck throttle.]</p>

<p>A reasoned case can be made for removing people from vehicle control loops.  But as long as they are there, allowing the computers to override the pilots is a lousy policy.<br />
______________________________</p>

<p>A family member who long worked as an aerodynamicist at Boeing explained to me (many years ago now) that as long as Boeing retains its ideas about flight controls, they would never replace the cockpit yokes with Airbus-style "sidesticks" (similar to gaming joysticks).</p>

<p>It's really a shock to me, and very sad, to learn that Boeing forgot how to incorporate the pilots' natural, tactile responses as a cornerstone of flight control safety.</p>

<p>Yeah, automation is supposed to warn you if you do something stupid, and to help you. The point is that the plane maker and airline teaches you about all those details. Not knowing those it's like having an evil twin in the cockpit that pushes the yoke down "just because". As an analogy, is like driving a car on the freeway and someone just turns your steering wheel right or left. </p>

<p>The 737 MAX problem is not easily attributable, is a systemic fault. You can't blame it on a specific person/company/issue. Can't blame it on Boeing, can't blame it on the FAA, can't blame it on the airlines, can't blame it on the pilots. We made a very good and efficient plane, but it's a bit harder to fly. Oh well, forget about it, it makes us money, why not ? How hard can it be to fly it ? and so on. Everybody has cut corners here, not just Boeing, not just the FAA , but everybody. Systemic fault. Too bad 300+ people had to die. </p>

<p>Just wanted to share , what I thought was a very well thought out email from one of the service provides I have an online account with, regarding a recent data breach they encountered on their system.</p>

<p>"Hello Kanopy Community:</p>

<p>I wanted to send you one final note with an update from my email yesterday, regarding the recent security incident we experienced at Kanopy. </p>

<p>We have hired a leading forensics firm to assist with our ongoing investigation and continue to gather more specific information. During the incident, some of our web logs were made available, showing usersâ IP addresses and associated activity. While this is unfortunate, we have no evidence to date that this information has been used maliciously and, upon learning of the incident, we immediately secured all of the data on our system. At this time, there is no required action for you to take.</p>

<p>For a five-hour window during the incident, it may have also exposed data from 162 accounts â a very small subset of our total user base â containing usersâ registered email address, Kanopy password, and in 82 cases, the public library account number. We have terminated the passwords for the known impacted accounts and have contacted those individuals via email so that they can take steps to reset their passwords. If you did not receive an email from us asking you to reset your Kanopy password, then we do not believe that your account was impacted.</p>

<p>Our investigation into the full scope of the incident remains ongoing, and, when more information is available, we will advise the impacted individuals as appropriate. <br />
We take the privacy and security of your personal information seriously and we apologize for any inconvenience or concern this may cause. "</p>

<p>@Rach El @James:</p>

<p>"Eucalyptus essential oil. quality kind that comes in a 10ml vial, not the supermarket variety. Or oregano oil essential oil."</p>

<p>Yes some essential oils do have antibiotic properties whilst others astringent properties, by which they protect themselves from microbes of various kinds (even real maple syrup has some if you don't cook them out). But... some also have protections against larger organics that munch thus they have poisons for us 'meat sacks'</p>

<p>Eucalyptus smells nice and can even make bad tempered Koalas appear more cute. However the reason for both their cuteness and bad temper is what they eat and the high levels of cyanide it contains. Whilst nearly ever tree that produces 'pitted fruit' generates some level of cyanide, they tend to localise it in the pits (stone kernels/seeds) the Eucaluptus puts it in the leves and other places as well along with it's high calorific oils. If you ever have the misfortune to be near a Eucalyptus when it burns you will find it burns hot and vigorously.</p>

<p>But it's not just trees many carbohydrate rich plant tubers also contain cyanide or other poisons some like cassava can have low quantities in some varieties and can have the cyanide simply processed out to a safe level, whilst other almost the same looking varieties can not... Look up 'Death by cassava' to see why you realy should listen to old grannie tales. The same is true for potatoes, tomatoes and rhubarb all of which you would have found in British gardens.</p>

<p>Contrary to what some says about security attacks not getting worse with time, food security is in part bassed on knowledge, and the knowledge is not getting handed down from generation to generation any longer. What I learnt about 'green potato' and various beans like 'kiddney beans' is not getting taught to most children.</p>

<p>But it's not just food security, ICT Security appears to suffer with mistakes endlessly repeated, a sure sign people are not learning from yesterdays mistakes.</p>

<p>And now the lack of 'past knowledge' mistakes have 'Physical Agency' and are killing people. The software industry in particular needs to get a grip on it's self before the politicians are forced to act, because in this century they tend to over react and 'kill the golden goose'.  </p>

<p><strong>Comments on the 'quality' of my country's BSc Infosec courses</strong></p>

<p>For the last couple of months, I've had the company at work of someone who did my country's officially sanctioned "Whitehat hacker" BSc programme. He can do penetration tests and the like, and has learned a lot about security (or so he thinks).</p>

<p>I've been less that impressed with his knowledge and especially his description of the courses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Almost exclusive focus on modern Windows and (Ubuntu) Linux. Macs are completely glossed over, security-oriented Linuxes are mentioned in passing (but no real experience) with the caveat that NONE of the Linuxes often mentioned on this blog are taught, other OSes are completely not mentioned, no knowledge of Unix history, no knowledge of differences between Ubuntu Linux and other *n*xes - and anything that isn't Windows or Ubuntu-derived apparently sucks.</li>
<li>Very strong focus on security through obscurity (that pretty much damns it all).</li>
<li>No clue where to find things on the internet that aren't part of the curriculum.</li>
<li>They teach about the Dark Web, as well as the more popular protocols (HTTP(S), FTP, Windows-exclusive shit...). Nothing about Usenet and other older protocols. Nothing about the less well-known seedier parts of the internet (e.g. Imageboards such as 4chan).</li>
<li>They are told about Hacker News...and that's pretty much it. Places such as security blogs and other things that might at occasion skirt my country's official position on what people may or may not do on the internet are unknown (and can't be found because they were told not to look for them).</li>
<li>Thinking out of the box is out of the question.</li>
<li>Lots of focus on all kind of gadgets and iot stuff, lots of focus on modern approaches, close to zero background knowledge.</li>
<li>Very limited methodological knowledge that would be very helpful on figuring out why things go wrong or don't work straight away. </li>
</ul>

<p>The result is a security researcher who doesn't seem to understand the essential parts of being a security researcher, simply because he was not taught how to be properly curious (or rather: it was partially extinguished during his education). Suggestions on where to find stuff are often ignored for the sole reason of "I've never heard of that, can't be good.", while anything he finds on his own must be good (without really looking into it). He makes a lot of avoidable errors as a result of this. Also, I didn't know that a good way of "hardening" a system was to install it with all possible optional software packages...</p>

<p>Much of this also generally applies to University level IT here...gods, it's bad. And the people that come out of it have no clue how bad they are.</p>

<p>@James,</p>

<p>"...The 737 MAX problem is not easily attributable, is a systemic fault. You can't blame it on a specific person/company/issue...."</p>

<p>The -accidents- were systemic faults, the -blame- rests -entirely- on Boeing.<br />
..</p>

<p>@Anyone,<br />
1. Some aircraft -cannot fly- without very sophisticated Flight Control Systems; the 737MAX is -not- one of them.</p>

<p>2. The human brain is quite capable of making split-second decisions in an emergency; pilots often have only seconds to do that.</p>

<p>3. We are quickly reaching the point where pilots are being overloaded with data regarding the behavior of the FCS, especially the human/machine interface.  If they encounter FCS anti-stall behavior during takeoff, they don't have time to review a checklist, folks are gonna die.</p>

<p>4. Extensive use of autopilot can result in complacency in the cockpit. Modern FCS can takeoff, fly and land by themselves.  This gives the technologists the idea that pilots can be eliminated.  It's already happening in the automotive sector.</p>

<p>I'm not usually a fan of retribution, but some cases call for it.  Class action lawsuits merely scratch the surface.  Jail time might be more appropriate.</p>

<p>Those two articles important to human factor in security, the second in particular related to necessity of privacy as well:</p>

<p>"I donât really think I believe that âbusiness speakâ exists,â he says. âWeâre all the same species of bipedal mammal. <br />
[!!!!}Putting business suits on a bunch of hairless primates and putting them together in an office block doesnât really change them much. [The way] they will tussle, rival each other, look for leadership, listen to each other, pick up words and phrases will evolve from each other.</p>

<p>New York City-based executive coach Alisa Cohn agrees. âWe are tribal animals, and there is something about jargon that marks us as insiders Â­â one of the tribe Â­â [who] will be protected and not eaten in the event of an attack by tigers.â</p>

<p>Cohn hears a lot of jargon in her line of work, and even has her own favorite words: âecosystemâ, âswim laneâ (aka scope of someoneâs job) and âpeanut butter the raisesâ, which she says âmeans spreads evenly like a peanut butter sandwichâ.<br />
*****</p>

<p>Weâre told that lying is always the worst option, but that isnât always true.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190324-what-if-we-knew-when-people-were-lying" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190324-what-if-we-knew-when-people-were-lying</a></p>

<p>"For Chidi and some other philosophers, the obligation not to lie trumps all other moral imperatives, including not hurting someoneâs feelings. Few people actually adhere to such a strict prescription for honesty, however. Lying is an accepted part of daily life, from our automatic response of âgoodâ when asked how we are, to the praise we give when a friend asks if we like her awful new haircut (or pair of boots).</p>

<p><br />
Yet despite the ubiquity of lies in our lives, most of us are not very good at detecting deception. What would happen, though, if we could suddenly tell, without a doubt, when we were being lied to? The technological or psychological mechanism that would enable this impossible new skill is not worth dwelling on. Instead, what matters is what it reveals about the often-overlooked and underestimated role lying plays in our lives.  </p>

<p>Many researchers believe humans began lying to each other almost as soon as they invented language, primarily as a way to get ahead. âLying is so easy compared to other ways of gaining power,â Sissela Bok, an ethicist at Harvard University, told National Geographic. âItâs much easier to lie in order to get somebodyâs money or wealth than to hit them over the head or rob a bank.â </p>

<p>Throughout human history, lying has also served as âan evolutionary necessity to protect ourselves from harm,â says Michael Lewis, a distinguished professor of paediatrics and psychiatry at Rutgers University. This includes protection from persecution â a purpose that lying still serves today for many people around the world. If we could suddenly detect all lies, lives in countries where infidelity, homosexuality or certain religious beliefs are illegal could be put at risk.</p>

<p>Lying also benefits us when the stakes are less high, including at work. If we told our boss what we really thought of him, or why we actually didnât make our deadline, we might be fired or demoted. We also lie to make ourselves look better and maintain an air of professionalism. âRecently, I was late to a meeting, and I just said the subway was slow,â says Kang Lee, a professor of applied psychology and human development at the University of Toronto. âIn fact, the subway didnât delay me â I was just late because of my own fault â but I donât think it would be good for me professionally if my colleagues could detect this.â</p>

<p>Weâd also have more hurt feelings. For most of us, a world without lies would deliver an immediate blow to our self-image, says Dan Ariely, professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University. âLiving with the truth means you would get more honest, brutal feedback about your work, the way you dress, the way you kiss â all kinds of things like that,â he says. âYou would realize that people donât pay as much attention to you and youâre not as important and highly qualified as you think you are.â</p>

<p>Children themselves learn the social value of lying from a very young age. âMom might say to the child, âListen, grandma is going to give you a present for Hanukkah, and youâve got to tell grandma that you like it, otherwise itâll hurt her feelings,ââ Lewis says. By the age of three or four, studies show that many children have mastered the art of the polite lie.</p>

<p>Indeed, in terms of interpersonal relationships, âit would be an utter disaster if we could in fact detect lying and deception,â Lewis says. âLying is a total and complete necessity in a culture in which the moral understanding is you donât want to hurt the feelings of other people.â</p>

<p>most people said they engaged in dishonesty in order to avoid hurting their partner or damaging their relationship. If romances suddenly involved total truthfulness about everything from the way our partner looks in the morning to whether we ever engaged in infidelity, many relationships likely would not last.</p>

<p>âI like to joke that the reason my wife and I have been married 40 years is because we have separate bathrooms,â Ekman says. âThatâs only partially a joke, though, because thereâs things you donât want people, even your spouse, to know about â and it isnât just bathroom behavior.â</p>

<p>It's impossible to predict all the ways we would benefit and suffer if all lies were laid bare, but what is for certain is that the world would be a very different place to the one we live in today. Humans, however, are adaptable, and âover time, we would develop new norms and acceptable codes of social conduct,â Bakir says.</p>

<p>At the same time, she continues, we would likely do all we could to develop new ways of lying and deceiving each other, whether through technology, drugs, social behavior or mental training.</p>

<p>Kang agrees. âIâm 100% certain weâd continue to deceive each other somehow, weâd just find a different way to do it. Itâs a life necessity.â</p>

<p>My take: sometimes small lie is better than big scandal.</p>

<p>"Newly Disclosed NSA Documents Shed Further Light on Five Eyes Alliance"</p>

<p>If you look back far enough on this blog you will find posts on both the BURSA (original name) and UKUSA (later name) agrements as they became 'officialy' public knowledge.</p>

<p>It's clear from those that various people had made earlier posts outlining much of what was under the agrements.</p>

<p>What the author of the article apparently does not realise is that the British set up the agrement in exactly that way, very specifically to their advantage. Even now the UK is still in many respects the dominant partner on policy and many operational asspects.</p>

<p>The original British idea was that the US did the manufacturing of equipment for the British, as well as providing technical staff at the lower layers. The British however would bring to the table what the US lacked and still does which is 'access'to satellites and cables. Part of the reason the US is fighting hard to keep the US the 'hub of the internet' is to try and remove the strangle hold on access the UK has via Australia, Canada, and New Zeland.</p>

<p>What few realise and the NZ Premier found out the hardway is they do not run their SigInt agencies and the agencies have no allegiance except in 'lip service' to their elected Governments and the citizens. Put simply the UK and to a lesser extent the US that run the show as an unalined entity responsible only to it's self. The UK usually setting the stratigic direction and the US implementing it. Even though 9/11 caused a major shake up of the US IC it had very little effect on the UK-US SigInt relationship. In part it's because of this that the questions about secondments of UK personnel in various key areas are being asked, but mainly ignored. Because it's actually not in the interests of either the US or UK SigInt's to change a system that serves them very well as effectively a combined or symbiotic entity.</p>

<p>In part the NSA has suffered a loss of turf to other parts of the US Mil&IC to do with the Internet. Whilst this would worry the NSA as an independent entity, what it has appeared to loose at home, has been more than covered by the UK and their dependent Five Eyes partners who have the access covered.</p>

<p>Which begs the question of US 'home traffic going international' if people care to look it up there is one heck of a load of US2US traffic that gets routed across international boundries by the likes of BGP misconfiguration. It's been assumed by some that this is the likes of the Chinese etc 'stealing traffic', few ask the obvious question of who benifits from these oddities over all, to which the answer is the Five-Eye SigInt community via the fairly obvious --if people look-- choke points sitting in the teritorial waters and skys of the non US Five-Eye partners.</p>

<p>Much of what this symbiotic SigInt entity gets upto at the base level is 'hiding in plain sight'. From this and a little thought gives you the stratigic direction and appropriate technical knowledge 'fills in the middle'.</p>

<p>As has been observed on this blog fairly often, these SigInt entities are realy not that much in front of the open academic and tellecommunication communities. Where they do have leads is becoming less relevant, which is just as well as the 'talent pool' they used to draw on has in effect dried up for them as they can no longer offer either the 'ego food' or 'material rewards' for such people in the face of Silicon Valley etc. Thus all the SigInt agencies are starting to suffer from 'in house time servers' and 'out sourced contractors' who only nominaly work for the SigInt agencies.</p>

<p>It is in effect 'COTS' wave II, they have to get not just their tech from the open market but now their staff as well. Which is the heart felt wish of the MIC with the likes of Silicon Valley effectively becoming the US IC technical arm and increasingly compeating with the SigInt and CommsInt analysts via 'Big Data' and orher leading edge tech. Have a look at Peter Thiels Palantair service and one or two others. What they hold tends to make Facebook look a joke. </p>

<p>"Many researchers believe humans began lying to each other almost as soon as they invented language, primarily as a way to get ahead."</p>

<p>They would be wrong...</p>

<p>Anthropologists worked out years ago that 'secrecy' thus 'deception' which is 'lying by deed or action' was happening right from the begining with tribes.</p>

<p>That is it was in a faimily or larger tribes interest to conceal prime food sights from other families and tribes.</p>

<p>Thus lying in it's various forms is a prime survival skill not just for humans, not just primates but most other mamals and hot blooded creatures.</p>

<p>Writing on the âDescription of SIGINT Relations between NSA and GCHQâ (December 1985) document, the authors of the Lawfare piece seem to touch on that here, but your point is clear:</p>

<blockquote>The document hints at how the two agencies facilitate such sharing in practice, including by ensuring that the âGCHQ has direct access to NSA computer systems.â</blockquote>

<p>Though the times they are 'a changin', collection remains paramount. As so, it seems to me that traffic shaping, 5g network slicing and IoT are ready-made efficiencies built to serve  the likes of XKeyscore interception and analysis engines. Where the two, UKUSA, come out on 5g will be interesting, to say the least.</p>

<p>@gordo:</p>

<p>"Where the two, UKUSA, come out on 5g will be interesting, to say the least."</p>

<p>The owner of most of the relevant 5G patents is China. The company concerned is known to have had a good relationship with not just the UK Gov, but also the public face of GCHQ via their center in Aylesbury UK where the GCHQ bods work alongside the company employees verifying not just code but hardware as well.</p>

<p>There have been few if any problems untill the US started making lots of noise about the company who unlike the US Gov has not been caught red handed hiding security failings in various major US Company products (not just Juniper and Cisco). Then the UK Gov issued a report that to be honest could have been aimed as much against the US Gov as it was the Chinese Gov. In simple terms they kind of said the company supply chain was vulnerable... That said it's fairly obvious that most major US Companies and UK companies all have supply chain issues, there is basically nothing that can be done about it and remain economically viable.</p>

<p>Back some years ago the NSA for instance had doubts about the integrity of it's supply chain even though at the time it was still making equipment entirely within the US. However it realy went 'out the window' when US Politicos decided that the NSA had to buy standard parts etc etc on not just on the commercial market, but the 'Consumer Of The Shelf' market. Which they knew ment that they would suffer from 'grey market' and 'counterfit market' issues, along with various dial home implants. If you remember back there was a lot of noise about the consumer arm that had once been part of IBM. The company that took it over was Lenovo and they were caught out installing 'Advanced Peraistant Threat' (APT) malware in the BIOS that used an original IBM PC feature supported by DOS and later Windows to alow 'IO ROM Code' to install malware no mater how often you replaced the OS or hard drive.</p>

<p>So realistically the UK Gov report via GCHQ was more 'political posturing' than anything else. As they have not as far as I know asked any other 5G tenderers to meet anything remotely like they do of the Chinese Company.</p>

<p>The joke is that EU legislation requires a level playing field for large tenders with Government involvement. The fact the UK Gov is not abiding by these rules kind of tells you fairly well nearly everthing you need to know about the UK-US 'Special Relationship' at the inter-government level.</p>

<p>But to be honest I rather hope 5G fails misserably, it actually has little to offer over 4GLTE in terms of performance and has the specific issue that 5G handsets are not transferable from one operator to another. So are the old equivalent of 'Service Provider Locked Phones' which in the EU is a bit of a 'no no'. Thus network interoperabilty with 5G can not realistically happen, thus it will fall back to 4GLTE anyway... So from the consumer perspective you have to ask what the 'value added' is for them and the answer is little or nothing.</p>

<p>Thoughts on the B737 Airliner Scandal<br />
...</p>

<p>well worded/well summarized but some errors in my opinion - When the MCAS system activates, a large wheel next to the pilots knee spins offering an immediate indication that the horizontal stabilizer is changing position<br />
based on time activated and rotation rate.  The wheel has a knob on it that can be pulled out if manual control is required/desired (suicide knob like).  If you pull out that knob and forget, automatic activation may bruise your leg/break your kneecap.  Likewise if you pull that out you can slow or jam the system so the drive motor can't move the stabilizer.  This design is common since 707/KC-135 aircraft in Boeing airplanes.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jetphotos/status/911612875923320832" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/jetphotos/status/911612875923320832</a><br />
see the big black wheels (edge view) on either side of the throttle quadrant.</p>

<p>The problem was the crew was task saturated and did not understand they needed to over ride an automatic system deliberately and with force because there was no guidance in the manual and no training to do so. They were using the yoke mounted manual drive to slew the stabilizer back into position, and then the faulty automatic system was driving if ever further out of trim - hence the aircraft was repeatedly pitching up and down.  While this was occuring they likely became fixated/task saturated and did not realize their airspeed was getting dangerously high on the descents.  It is entirely probable they damaged/tore off a flight control surface from excess airspeed/dynamic pressure on the last dive which precluded the ability to recover.</p>

<p>The automatic system was installed because the center of thrust with the new engines was forward of the old engines and Boeing wanted the plane to manually handle similar to the old 737 so no retraining was required.</p>

<p>Increasing the thrust on the new aircraft as you would in a go around or other emergency scenario, causes a greater pitch up moment due to the new forward center of thrust.  Changing the horizontal stabilizer position automatically (without pilot action) counters this moment (in theory) so the aircraft continues to handle normally (as expected like an old 737) in manual flight control.  Tragic that nobody throught this through.  But also explains why a culture with a suspicion of automatic systems and a mental mind set/willingness to override automatic systems could deal with this emergency and save the aircraft while a culture of compliant/passive people might not due to reluctance to counter authority (automatic control).  I would have found the damn circuit breaker powering the drive screw motor and pulled it, and then reverted to manual positioning of the horizontal stabilizer for the balance of the flight.  Any malfunction of this system should have been a red X in the aircraft logs prohibiting flight until repaired - but since the system didn't exist in the pilots aircraft manuals, they could only write up the general stabilizer system and not the automatic drive function (MCAS) as they did not know it existed!  That is Boeings criminal act - failure to fully inform the pilots due to their desire for common training requirements with the older 737s.</p>

Recently (several month ago) on American Heroes Channel (USA) such fact was disclosed:<br />
In 1940 when Britain was already in war with Nazi Germany, they (GB) provided Roosevelt with allegedly stolen from Germans plan to invade and occupy Panama Canal in order to bring US to war with Germany. Hitler find it out somehow and was pissed off because Germany never had such plans. It was discovered later that British Intel fabricated that plan (fake news of 1940).<br />
Just interesting fact of the history of relationship. That is regarding lying to survive even to close ally. </p>

<p>Has Never Say Anything done it again?</p>

<p>Even if they have when are people going to get to grips with the idea that 'code signing' is a busted security mechanism and they have to be way more proactive, especially the development side.</p>

<p>This is a quite spectacular in many ways Supply Chain attack,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/25/asus_software_update_utility_backdoor/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/25/asus_software_update_utility_backdoor/</a></p>

<p>Backend servers in Asus Taiwan got attacked in some way as a result a false update file of the right size and apparently signed by Asus's security key was put in place of a routien update download.</p>

<p>The result probably over a million computers infected with the malware.</p>

<p>Why did it not come to notice more readily by side effects etc? Well apparently it was only aimed at six hundred machines...</p>

<p>This kind of puts it in the State Level Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) catagory. Which is not to say it is a Nation State but the level of resources required is similar to that of just a few nation states, and the number of actual targets is very small. Thus the returns required are way above what most Cyber-Criminals would be capable of and also suggest it's very much geo-political in intent.</p>

<p>What would be interesting to see is an analysis of those 600 machine identities, then maybe Shodan them etc ;-)</p>

<p>EU rejects US calls over 5G.</p>

<p>I guess most know there is a trade war between the US and China, and that this is causing diplomatic silliness.</p>

<p>One such side of US trade policy appears to be accusing without supplying evidence that companies in these nations are being used to commit espionage. Which is a bit embarasing because the US has been caught red-handed doing exactly this a number of times.</p>

<p>One aspect is the US appears to think that other nations should follow suit without question. And if they do not then they get threatened / blackmailed by the US...</p>

<p>Well a little while ago Germany told the US where it could go in this respect, and to ramp up the preasure even more the EU has just come out and said it's up to individual nations within the EU to come up with their own 5G suppliers list. Which some see as a snub to the US,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/26/euro_5g_plans/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/26/euro_5g_plans/</a></p>

<p>No doubt there will be tweets after bed time on this, but it would be fun just to sit back and watch if it were not so serious.</p>

<p>There is one fun side though, any one remember the strange 'Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS)' mechanism  clauses in the previous administrations 'trade policies' over disputes?</p>

<p>Well it would have put the US Gov in the position of being judged and getting fined, because premptive 'national security' argument is not a valid reason for refusing to allow companies or products already in the US market to continue to remain...</p>

<p>AT&T CEO says China's Huawei hinders carriers from shifting suppliers for 5G<br />
David Shepardson, Reuters, March 20, 2019</p>

<blockquote>AT&T Inc Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said Wednesday that Chinaâs Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is making it very difficult for European carriers to drop the company from its supply chain for next-generation 5G wireless service.

<p><br />
"If you have deployed Huawei as your 4G network, Huawei is not allowing interoperability to 5G -- meaning if you are 4G, you are stuck with Huawei for 5G," said Stephenson at a speech in Washington. "When the Europeans say we got a problem -- that's their problem. They really don't have an option to go to somebody else."</p></blockquote>

<p>Huey Pilot wrote:</p>

<p>"I would have found the damn circuit breaker powering the drive screw motor and pulled it"</p>

<p>That's how a safe pilot thinks.  Because (as I explained above) the stabilizer is so much more powerful than the elevator in a jet transport, a mispositioned stabilizer can doom the aircraft.</p>

<p>For this reason, a runaway stabilizer (i.e., large deflection not correctable by the cockpit crew) is among the most dangerous of flight control malfunctions, and it's a matter of life and death to arrest the deflection before it becomes impossible to maintain a normal pitch attitude.</p>

<p>So if a runaway is suspected, the thing to do is pull the breaker immediately, and leave analysis of the fault for later.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this type of runaway is extremely rare.  One sad case comes to mind which was not a failure of any of the active systems, but rather mechanical breakage of the link to the stabilizer.  The pilots were able to keep their jet aloft for just a few horrifying minutes ...</p>

<p>"NCSC does not believe that the defects identified are a result of Chinese state interference" (p.21 of report PDF). I guess there's a bright side to everything . . . ;)</p>

<p>UK cyber security officials report Huaweiâs security practices are a mess<br />
<i>Huawei never delivered on changes promised years ago, National Cybersecurity Centre reports.</i><br />
by Sean Gallagher - Mar 28, 2019</p>

<blockquote>The problems unearthed by HCSEC [Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre], however, suggest that the bigger threat is that Huawei gear could be hacked by just about anyone who cared to make an effort. And because of how Huawei runs its software development, itâs impossible to give blanket certification for any one productâs security.</blockquote>

<p>Interesting is who funded research:<br />
"This research was supported initially by the Human Frontiers Science Program and more recently by the <br />
RadioBio program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to the Caltech group,<br />
 by the Japanese Science and Technology Agency (CREST) to Wang and Shimojo, and by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science to the University of Tokyo group."</p>

<p>@gordo:</p>

<p>"'UK cyber security officials report Huaweiâs security practices are a mess'"</p>

<p>Yup I'm fairly sure they are, just like every other company that compeates in markets where such aspects are 'not regulated for'.</p>

<p>In fact we know both Cisco and Jupiter are in that mess atleast as badly if not worse, considerably worse. Then there are the other telco back end providers like Ericsson, lets just say 'the less said the better', as people want to sleep at night.</p>

<p>The problem is these are engineering organisations driven by over heated 'market expectations' that to be honest have now crossed a tipping point that we have seen with IoT and other markets. Speed to market now trumps the more traditional values of reliability, stability, quality, and worst of all 'good engineering practice'.</p>

<p>The fact that the NCSC is holding them to some 'ideal' the market obviously does not want nor can it afford in the face of competition kind of says just how out of touch the NCSC are with the reality of the current market.</p>

<p>If nations want telecommunications security rather than the ability to spy on others or play idiotic power politics games, then they need to 'level the playing field' and hold all potential market suppliers to the same standards by regulation with no exception. But that won't happen as long as 'home market protectionism' and 'collect it all' are in play.</p>

<p>Oh and to be honest you have to ask when the mobile telecommunications market is going to collapse in on it's self. Actually sit down and go through the 4G-LTE and 5G specs and produce a list of pros and cons. Then compare the 5G pros with what you loose from 4G-LTE pros.</p>

<p>Take a close look at how 5G falls back to 4G-LTE then the price you pay for 5G like the fact you do not get network roaming with 5G but you do with 4G-LTE. Yes I know that some bits of 5G might potentially turn into the new SMS but it's actually not that likely when you consider how 5G gets it's supposed advantages.</p>

<p>I'm still a 3G user and don't want much of what 4G let alone 4G-LTE offers. But the dirty little secret that the mobile industry is not talking about publically is 2G users. Or more correctly 2G using infrastructure that won't or can not be upgraded, things like smart meters, electricity/gas/water supply control, industrial control systems, traffic lights, vehical tracking for delivery control, road toll/tracking systems and lots more you don't see even though it's all around you. Mobile is even replacing 'emergancy radio' used by first responders and the like and the official parts use 2/3G because it's cheap. That is the nature of accountancy led infrastructure, and it's getting worse daily as people are replaced by communications technology that is expensive, then by mobile technology on the cheap, which unfortunatly is fast becoming a millstone around the Mobile Service Providers necks.</p>

<p>Hereâs proof Huawei is now a titanic consumer brand<br />
<i>Revenue from the smartphone division ballooned by 45 percent</i><br />
By Jon Porter, The Verge, Mar 29, 2019</p>

<blockquote>Huawei has announced record financial results for the last year. The companyâs revenue increased to $105 billion, a 20 percent annual rise, while profit was up by 25 percent to $8 billion. The New York Times notes that the results put Huawei in the same league as Google and Microsoft, which both passed the $100 billion milestone last year.

<p><br />
[. . .]</p>

<p>Revenue from Huaweiâs carrier technology division was weaker. Reuters notes that revenue from this unit fell by 1.3 percent last year, although Huawei explained that the fall was caused by telecoms investment cycles.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Ahh, but wouldn't you know it, last year Huawei started a bi-monthly patch schedule for mostly their flagship smartphones. "Primarily, each update will include the latest monthly Android security patches." <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Huawei-smartphones-updates-schedule_id106157" rel="nofollow">https://www.phonearena.com/news/Huawei-smartphones-updates-schedule_id106157</a></p>

<p>The more things change, . . .</p>

	<h2 class="entry" id="a012002">Hacking Instagram to Get Free Meals in Exchange for Positive Reviews</h2>
	
	
		
	
    
	    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@chrisbuetti/how-i-eat-for-free-in-nyc-using-python-automation-artificial-intelligence-and-instagram-a5ed8a1e2a10">This</a> is a fascinating hack:</p>

<blockquote><p>In today's digital age, a large Instagram audience is considered a valuable currency. I had also heard through the grapevine that I could monetize a large following -- or in my desired case -- use it to have my meals paid for. <i>So I did just that</i>.

<p>I created an Instagram page that showcased pictures of New York City's skylines, iconic spots, elegant skyscrapers Â­-- you name it. The page has amassed a following of over 25,000 users in the NYC area and it's still rapidly growing.</p>

<p>I reach out restaurants in the area either via Instagram's direct messaging or email and offer to post a positive review in return for a free entree or at least a discount. Almost every restaurant I've messaged came back at me with a compensated meal or a gift card. Most places have an allocated marketing budget for these types of things so they were happy to offer me a free dining experience in exchange for a promotion. I've ended up giving some of these meals away to my friends and family because at times I had too many queued up to use myself.</p>

<p>The beauty of this all is that <b>I automated the whole thing</b>. And I mean 100% of it. I wrote code that finds these pictures or videos, makes a caption, adds hashtags, credits where the picture or video comes from, weeds out bad or spammy posts, posts them, follows and unfollows users, likes pictures, monitors my inbox, and most importantly -- both direct messages and emails restaurants about a potential promotion. Since its inception, I haven't even really logged into the account. I spend zero time on it. It's essentially a robot that operates like a human, but the average viewer can't tell the difference. And as the programmer, I get to sit back and admire its (and my) work.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much going on in this project.</p>

<p>Yes, clever and all. But I don't think I would be proud of this part:</p>

<p>"Now, none of the content my account posts is owned by me. This is a contested topicâââsome people seem to think this can lead to some issues. However, if you credit where the content comes from itâs usually not a problem. Iâve never had any issues re-sharing content. In fact, Iâve only had people thank me for sharing their photos. Worst case, someone reports your post and it gets taken down by Instagram. As long as you give credit where credit is due, you should be good."</p>

<p>He is not concerned about whether it is right to steal other people's content, just whether it gets in the way of him getting a free meal.</p>

<p>Yup it looks like it is a lot of work for a 'free meal'.</p>

<p>But it's not a 'free meal' at all.</p>

<p>Look at it from the other side, food in most restaurants is the least expensive part of the operation, you only have to look at the wine list prices to know where they try to make the most money.</p>

<p>They will see the cost of that meal as less than the postage and admin of getting the voucher to him. And way way less than they would otherwise have to pay for advertising via leaflets, local papers, hordings and the sides of busses. Knowing that the eyes on those going to that site are going to the site because they want to.</p>

<p>I would say the restaurants are getting a realy good deal out of his hard work, especially if he also leaves the staff a tip.</p>

<p>But it probably won't last because fairly soon lots of people will do the same thing, and as he notes there is a budjet for advertising.</p>

<p>But whilst it's going for him, I wish him the best at it, he's earned it.</p>

<p>The Social Engineer goes to the restaurant; pretends to be a writer for  a famous magazine; asks if they are interested in a review; gets the free meal.</p>

<p>Its OK, most of the followers of the Instagram account are probably bots too.</p>

<p>I predict that in the future, 90% of the world's economy will be bots sending spam to other bots, that filter and repackage it to spam it to other bots.</p>

<p>@zuc</p>

<p>That is not a new observation. Study the topic of clickjack fraud. Some astute commentators think that in the early years Google's entire business model was "fake it till you make it." The problem was that no one could ever come up with hard proof that Google was behind the problem. </p>

<p>More broadly I am reminded of the observation that highly advanced technology is the same as magic.</p>

<p>Clever, @zuc.</p>

<p>The other problem with this strategy is that the supply of restaurants is not unlimited.</p>

</p>
<p>@Jason</p>

<p>The supply of restaurants is not unlimited, but neither is the demand from a single person. Even if I lived in San Francisco, and could afford to dine out for every meal, I suspect I could not get around to every restaurant on a list created as a snapshot at a single instant. Many will go out of business before I reach their position in the list, to be replaced by others. Or, you know, I could get bored with the whole process, or maybe die, during this marathon review task.</p>

<p>And NYC has even more restaurants.</p>

<p>But I agree that if "everybody" (or even a noticeable fraction of the populace) did this, the scheme would collapse.</p>

<p>Hack: gain unauthorized access to data in a system or computer</p>

<p>The story is indeed fascinating but I can hardly call that a hack. Sure, OP is pretty skilled and is knowledgeable about automation/coding. Other parts are mostly trivial webmarketing tactics or Instagram uses (follow/unfollow, repost, direct messages, content scrapping, customization...).</p>

<p>@1&1~=Umm<br />
>  I would say the restaurants are getting a realy good deal out of his hard work, especially if he also leaves the staff a tip.<br />
Same, especially if this account manages to attract human users. Even 1% will be enough</p>

<p>@zuc<br />
> Its OK, most of the followers of the Instagram account are probably bots too.<br />
You're statistically right, but it's common sense. Most digital marketers know that too and they are willing to deal with bots noise if they can achieve a decent ROI. Platform metrics may be rigged but the bottom line does not lie.</p>

<p>This is not interesting because of the free meals. Think of this technique used in more sophisticated influence campaigns.</p>

<p><i>and offer to post a positive review</i></p>

<p>It's not clear whether the review too was created automatically.</p>

<p>A "positive" review? Please, honest reviewing work doesn't work like that.</p>

<p>In the cult film "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XB0hTPKVKQ" rel="nofollow">L'aile ou la cuisse</a>" (1976), Louis de FunÃ¨s plays a "Guide Michelin" type inspector who visits restaurants incognito and bestows stars on them. In this scene he disguises as a clichÃ©d American tourist (complete with pink suit, purse, Hawaiian shirt, and 5-gallon hat) to check out a particularly seedy establishment. ("Where are the toilets please? Down the hallway, follow the flies".) [for some reason the punch line at the end was cut out.]</p>

<p><i>in return for a free entree or at least a discount.</i></p>

<p>Will eat for food!<br />

<p>@bruce</p>

<p>Yes, and what is startling is just how few real people need to be influnced for the viral contagion to happen. Studies in behavorial/social contagion indicate that a critical mass of between 5-15% is all that is needed before ideas and emotional affects begin to spread spontaneously  within a targeted population. There have been similar results found by those who study innovation propagation.</p>

<p>So one does not need to fool all the people all the time. Fool some of the people some of the time and these early converts will do the rest of the work of social influence. </p>

	    <p>This is an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/how-microsoft-found-a-huawei-driver-that-opened-systems-up-to-attack/">interesting story</a> of a serious vulnerability in a Huawei driver that Microsoft found. The vulnerability is similar in style to the NSA's DOUBLEPULSAR that was leaked by the Shadow Brokers -- believed to be the Russian government -- and it's obvious that this attack copied that technique.</p>

<p>What is less clear is whether the vulnerability -- which has been fixed -- was put into the Huwei driver accidentally or on purpose.</p>

	    <p>Kaspersky Labs is <a href="https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/">reporting</a> on a new supply chain attack they call "Shadowhammer."</p>

<blockquote><p>In January 2019, we discovered a sophisticated supply chain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility. The attack took place between June and November 2018 and according to our telemetry, it affected a large number of users. 

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, which were identified by their network adapters' MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses in the trojanized samples and this list was used to identify the actual intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique MAC addresses from over 200 samples used in this attack. Of course, there might be other samples out there with different MAC addresses in their list.</p>

<p>We believe this to be a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses <a href="https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/">the Shadowpad</a> and the <a href="https://blog.avast.com/update-to-the-ccleaner-5.33.6162-security-incident">CCleaner</a> incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed with legitimate certificates (eg: "ASUSTeK Computer Inc."). The malicious updaters were hosted on the official liveupdate01s.asus[.]com and liveupdate01.asus[.]com ASUS update servers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sophistication of the attack leads to the speculation that a nation-state -- and one of the cyber powers -- is responsible.</p>

<p>As I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/05/supply-chain_se.html">previously written</a>, supply chain security is "an incredibly complex problem." These attacks co-opt the very mechanisms we need to trust for our security. And the international nature of our industry results in an array of vulnerabilities that are very hard to secure.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3345967/is-the-world-ready-for-the-next-big-ransomware-attack.html">This</a> will complicate things:</p>

<blockquote><p>To complicate matters, having cyber insurance might not cover everyone's losses. Zurich American Insurance Company refused to pay out a $100 million claim from Mondelez, saying that since the U.S. and other governments <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-25/">labeled</a> the NotPetya attack as an action by the Russian military their claim <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-11/mondelez-lawsuit-shows-the-dangers-of-attributing-cyberattacks">was excluded</a> under the "hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war" exemption.</p></blockquote>

<p>I get that $100 million is real money, but the insurance industry needs to figure out how to properly insure commercial networks against this sort of thing.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/google-play-malware-used-phones-motion-sensors-to-conceal-itself/">This</a> is clever</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Malicious apps hosted in the Google Play market are trying a clever trick to avoid detection -- they monitor the motion-sensor input of an infected device before installing a powerful banking trojan to make sure it doesn't load on emulators researchers use to detect attacks.

<p>The thinking behind the monitoring is that sensors in real end-user devices will record motion as people use them. By contrast, emulators used by security researchersÂ­ -- and possibly Google employees screening apps submitted to PlayÂ­ -- are less likely to use sensors. Two Google Play apps <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/google-play-apps-drop-anubis-banking-malware-use-motion-based-evasion-tactics/">recently caught dropping the Anubis banking malware on infected devices</a> would activate the payload only when motion was detected first. Otherwise, the trojan would remain dormant.</p></blockquote><br />

	    <p>A new variant of the Shamoon malware has destroyed significant amounts of data at a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/12/13/warnings-as-destructive-shamoon-cyber-attacks-hit-middle-east-energy-industry/?ss=cybersecurity#2771dcae3e0f">UAE "heavy engineering company"</a> and the Italian oil and gas contractor <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/shamoon-malware-destroys-data-at-italian-oil-and-gas-company/">Saipem</a>.</p>

<p>Shamoon is the Iranian malware that was targeted against the Saudi Arabian oil company, Saudi Aramco, in 2012 and 2016. We have no idea if this new variant is also Iranian in origin, or if it is someone else entirely using the old Iranian code base.</p>

	    <p>Kaspersky is <a href="https://securelist.com/darkvishnya/89169/">reporting</a> on a series of bank hacks -- called DarkVishnya -- perpetrated through malicious hardware being surreptitiously installed into the target network:</p>

<blockquote><p>In 2017-2018, Kaspersky Lab specialists were invited to research a series of cybertheft incidents. Each attack had a common springboard: an unknown device directly connected to the company's local network. In some cases, it was the central office, in others a regional office, sometimes located in another country. At least eight banks in Eastern Europe were the targets of the attacks (collectively nicknamed DarkVishnya), which caused damage estimated in the tens of millions of dollars.

<p>Each attack can be divided into several identical stages. At the first stage, a cybercriminal entered the organization's building under the guise of a courier, job seeker, etc., and connected a device to the local network, for example, in one of the meeting rooms. Where possible, the device was hidden or blended into the surroundings, so as not to arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>The devices used in the DarkVishnya attacks varied in accordance with the cybercriminals' abilities and personal preferences. In the cases we researched, it was one of three tools:</p>

<ul><li>netbook or inexpensive laptop
<li>Raspberry Pi computer
<li>Bash Bunny, a special tool for carrying out USB attacks</ul>

<p>Inside the local network, the device appeared as an unknown computer, an external flash drive, or even a keyboard. Combined with the fact that Bash Bunny is comparable in size to a USB flash drive, this seriously complicated the search for the entry point. Remote access to the planted device was via a built-in or USB-connected GPRS/3G/LTE modem.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cory Doctorow <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/11/26/candy-from-strangers.html">points out</a> that this is a clever new attack vector:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many open source projects attain a level of "maturity" where no one really needs any new features and there aren't a lot of new bugs being found, and the contributors to these projects dwindle, often to a single maintainer who is generally grateful for developers who take an interest in these older projects and offer to share the choresome, intermittent work of keeping the projects alive. 

<p>Ironically, these are often projects with millions of users, who trust them specifically because of their stolid, unexciting maturity. </p>

<p>This presents a scary social-engineering vector for malware: A malicious person volunteers to help maintain the project, makes some small, positive contributions, gets commit access to the project, and releases a malicious patch, infecting millions of users and apps.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The Daily Beast is <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-intercept-shuts-down-access-to-snowden-trove">reporting</a> that First Look Media -- home of The Intercept and Glenn Greenwald -- is shutting down access to the Snowden archives.</p>

<p>The Intercept was the home for Greenwald's subset of Snowden's NSA documents since 2014, after he parted ways with the <em>Guardian</em> the year before. I don't know the details of how the archive was stored, but it was offline and well secured -- and it was available to journalists for research purposes. Many stories were published based on those archives over the years, albeit fewer in recent years.</p>

<p>The article doesn't say what "shutting down access" means, but my guess is that it means that First Look Media will no longer make the archive available to outside journalists, and probably not to staff journalists, either. Reading between the lines, I think they will delete what they have.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that we're done with the documents. Glenn Greenwald <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1106015482598043648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Both Laura & I have full copies of the archives, as do others. The Intercept has given full access to multiple media orgs, reporters & researchers. I've been looking for the right partner -- an academic institution or research facility -- that has the funds to robustly publish.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm sure there are still stories in those NSA documents, but with many of them a decade or more old, they are increasingly history and decreasingly current events. Every capability discussed in the documents needs to be read with a "and then they had ten years to improve this" mentality.</p>

<p>Eventually it'll all become public, but not before it is 100% history and 0% current events.</p>

	    <p>This isn't a security story, but it easily could have been. Last Saturday, Zipcar had a <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/03/13/zipcar-disruption-reveals-vagaries-tech-connectivity/OXdeNy9L6aLD1Yz6qyemdK/story.html">system outage</a>: "an outage experienced by a third party telecommunications vendor disrupted connections between the company's vehicles and its reservation software."</p>

<p>That didn't just mean people couldn't get cars they reserved. Sometimes is meant they couldn't get the cars they were already driving to work:</p>

<blockquote><p>Andrew Jones of Roxbury was stuck on hold with customer service for at least a half-hour while he and his wife waited inside a Zipcar that would not turn back on after they stopped to fill it up with gas.

<p>"We were just waiting and waiting for the call back," he said.</p>

<p>Customers in other states, including New York, California, and Oregon, reported a similar problem. One user who tweeted about issues with a Zipcar vehicle listed his location as Toronto.</p>

<p>Some, like Jones, stayed with the inoperative cars. Others, including Tina Penman in Portland, Ore., and Heather Reid in Cambridge, abandoned their Zipcar. Penman took an Uber home, while Reid walked from the grocery store back to her apartment. </p></blockquote>

<p>This is a reliability issue that turns into a safety issue. Systems that touch the direct physical world like this need better fail-safe defaults.</p>

	    <p>Andrew Odlyzko's new essay is worth reading -- "<a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/cyberinsecurity.pdf">Cybersecurity is not very important</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> There is a rising tide of security breaches. There is an even faster rising tide of hysteria over the ostensible reason for these breaches, namely the deficient state of our information infrastructure. Yet the world is doing remarkably well overall, and has not suffered any of the oft-threatened giant digital catastrophes. This continuing general progress of society suggests that cyber security is not very important. Adaptations to cyberspace of techniques that worked to protect the traditional physical world have been the main means of mitigating the problems that occurred. This "chewing gum and baling wire"approach is likely to continue to be the basic method of handling problems that arise, and to provide adequate levels of security.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am reminded of <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3328555/security/maybe-we-have-the-cybersecurity-we-deserve.html">these</a> <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-reason-software-remains-insecure/">two</a> essays. And, as I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/01/why_internet_se.html">said</a> in the blog post about those two essays:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is true, and is something I worry will <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">change</a> in a world of physically capable computers. Automation, autonomy, and physical agency will make computer security a matter of life and death, and not just a matter of data.</p></blockquote>

			<h2 class="entry" id="a011987"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/cas_reissue_ove.html">CAs Reissue Over One Million Weak Certificates</a></h2>
			
		
	
    
	    <p>Turns out that the software a bunch of CAs used to generate public-key certificates <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-google-godaddy-misissued-tls-certificates-with-weak-serial-numbers/">was</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/godaddy-apple-and-google-goof-results-in-1-million-misissued-certificates/">flawed</a>: they created random serial numbers with only 63 bits instead of the required 64. That may not seem like a big deal to the layman, but that one bit change means that the serial numbers only have half the required entropy. This really isn't a security problem; the serial numbers are to protect against attacks that involve weak hash functions, and we don't allow those weak hash functions anymore. Still, it's a good thing that the CAs are reissuing the certificates. The point of a standard is that it's to be followed.<br />

	    <p>An <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2938033">article I co-wrote</a> -- my first law journal article -- was <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/03/06/12564.pdf">cited</a> by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court -- the state supreme court -- in a case on compelled decryption.</p>

<p>Here's the first, in footnote 1:</p>

<blockquote><p>We understand the word "password" to be synonymous with other terms that cell phone users may be familiar with, such as Personal Identification Number or "passcode." Each term refers to the personalized combination of letters or digits that, when manually entered by the user, "unlocks" a cell phone. For simplicity, we use "password" throughout. See generally, Kerr & Schneier, Encryption Workarounds, 106 Geo. L.J. 989, 990, 994, 998 (2018).</p></blockquote>

<p>And here's the second, in footnote 5:</p>

<blockquote><p>We recognize that ordinary cell phone users are likely unfamiliar with the complexities of encryption technology. For instance, although entering a password "unlocks" a cell phone, the password itself is not the "encryption key" that decrypts the cell phone's contents. See Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em> at 995. Rather, "entering the [password] decrypts the [encryption] key, enabling the key to be processed and unlocking the phone. This two-stage process is invisible to the casual user." <em>Id</em>. Because the technical details of encryption technology do not play a role in our analysis, they are not worth belaboring. Accordingly, we treat the entry of a password as effectively decrypting the contents of a cell phone. For a more detailed discussion of encryption technology, see generally Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em>.</p></blockquote>

			<h2 class="entry" id="a011986"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/critical_flaw_i.html">Critical Flaw in Swiss Internet Voting System</a></h2>
			
		
	
    
	    <p>Researchers have found a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zmakk3/researchers-find-critical-backdoor-in-swiss-online-voting-system"> critical flaw</a> in the Swiss Internet voting system. I was going to write an essay about how this demonstrates that Internet voting is a stupid idea and should never be attempted -- and that this system in particular should never be deployed, even if the found flaw is fixed -- but Cory Doctorow <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/03/13/principal-agent-problems.html">beat me to it</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The belief that companies can be trusted with this power defies all logic, but it persists. Someone found Swiss Post's embrace of the idea too odious to bear, and they leaked the source code that Swiss Post had shared under its nondisclosure terms, and then an international team of some of the world's top security experts (including some of our favorites, like <a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22matthew%20green%22">Matthew Green</a>) set about analyzing that code, and (as every security expert who doesn't work for an e-voting company has predicted since the beginning of time), they found an incredibly powerful bug that would allow a single untrusted party at Swiss Post to undetectably alter the election results.

<p>And, as everyone who's ever advocated for the right of security researchers to speak in public without permission from the companies whose products they were assessing has predicted since the beginning of time, Swiss Post and Scytl downplayed the importance of this objectively very, very, very important bug. Swiss Post's position is that since the bug only allows elections to be stolen by Swiss Post employees, it's not a big deal, because Swiss Post employees wouldn't steal an election.</p>

<p>But when Swiss Post agreed to run the election, they promised an e-voting system based on "zero knowledge" proofs that would allow voters to trust the outcome of the election <i>without</i> having to trust Swiss Post. Swiss Post is now moving the goalposts, saying that it wouldn't be such a big deal if you had to trust Swiss Post implicitly to trust the outcome of the election.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, "Well, what <i>is</i> the big deal? If you don't trust the people administering an election, you can't trust the election's outcome, right?" Not really: we design election systems so that multiple, uncoordinated people all act as checks and balances on each other. To suborn a well-run election takes massive coordination at many polling- and counting-places, as well as independent scrutineers from different political parties, as well as outside observers, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Read the whole thing. It's excellent.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw84q7/darpa-is-building-a-dollar10-million-open-source-secure-voting-system">This</a> sounds like a good development:</p>

<blockquote><p>...a new $10 million contract the Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has launched to design and build a secure voting system that it hopes will be impervious to hacking.

<p>The first-of-its-kind system will be designed by an Oregon-based firm called Galois, a longtime government contractor with experience in designing secure and verifiable systems. The system will use fully open source voting software, instead of the closed, proprietary software currently used in the vast majority of voting machines, which no one outside of voting machine testing labs can examine. More importantly, it will be built on secure open source hardware, made from special secure designs and techniques developed over the last year as part of a special program at DARPA. The voting system will also be designed to create fully verifiable and transparent results so that voters don't have to blindly trust that the machines and election officials delivered correct results.</p>

<p>But DARPA and Galois won't be asking people to blindly trust that their voting systems are secure -- as voting machine vendors currently do. Instead they'll be publishing source code for the software online and bring prototypes of the systems to the Def Con Voting Village this summer and next, so that hackers and researchers will be able to freely examine the systems themselves and conduct penetration tests to gauge their security. They'll also be working with a number of university teams over the next year to have them examine the systems in formal test environments.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011998"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/malware_install.html">Malware Installed in Asus Computers through Hacked Update Process</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Kaspersky Labs is <a href="https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/">reporting</a> on a new supply chain attack they call "Shadowhammer."</p>

<blockquote><p>In January 2019, we discovered a sophisticated supply chain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility. The attack took place between June and November 2018 and according to our telemetry, it affected a large number of users. 

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, which were identified by their network adapters' MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses in the trojanized samples and this list was used to identify the actual intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique MAC addresses from over 200 samples used in this attack. Of course, there might be other samples out there with different MAC addresses in their list.</p>

<p>We believe this to be a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses <a href="https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/">the Shadowpad</a> and the <a href="https://blog.avast.com/update-to-the-ccleaner-5.33.6162-security-incident">CCleaner</a> incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed with legitimate certificates (eg: "ASUSTeK Computer Inc."). The malicious updaters were hosted on the official liveupdate01s.asus[.]com and liveupdate01.asus[.]com ASUS update servers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sophistication of the attack leads to the speculation that a nation-state -- and one of the cyber powers -- is responsible.</p>

<p>As I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/05/supply-chain_se.html">previously written</a>, supply chain security is "an incredibly complex problem." These attacks co-opt the very mechanisms we need to trust for our security. And the international nature of our industry results in an array of vulnerabilities that are very hard to secure.</p>

<p>Kim Zetter has a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers">really good article</a> on this.

	    <p>Back in October, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies">reported</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom">that</a> China has managed to install backdoors into server equipment that ended up in networks belonging to -- among others -- Apple and Amazon. Pretty much everybody has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-amazon-apple-supermicro-and-beijing-respond">denied</a> it (including the US <a href="https://gizmodo.com/homeland-security-denies-report-that-chinese-spies-put-1829585079">DHS</a> and the UK <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-britain/uk-cyber-security-agency-backs-apple-amazon-china-hack-denials-idUSKCN1MF1DN">NCSC</a>). Bloomberg has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/bloomberg-stands-by-chinese-chip-story-as-apple-amazon-ratchet-up-denials/">stood by</a> its story -- and is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/11/27/bloomberg-is-still-reporting-on-challenged-story-regarding-china-hardware-hack/">still standing</a> by it.</p>

<p>I don't think it's real. Yes, it's plausible. But first of all, if someone actually surreptitiously put malicious chips onto motherboards en masse, we would have seen a photo of the alleged chip already. And second, there are easier, more effective, and less obvious ways of adding backdoors to networking equipment.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (12/17): SuperMicro now <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/12/supermicro-refutes-report-of-malicious-implants-with-audit/#p3">denies</a> it.</p>

	    <p>Two New Yorkers <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Father-Son-Sell-Squid-Octopus-New-York-Long-Island-494462231.html">have been charged</a> with importing squid from Peru and then reselling it as octopus.</p>

<p>Yet another problem that a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/03/23/how-blockchain-will-transform-the-supply-chain-and-logistics-industry/">blockchain-enabled supply-chain system</a> won't solve.</p>

<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven't covered.</p>

<p>Our neighborhood has community PO Boxes at the end of each street.  Individual house boxes are locked, and there are a couple of drop slots to mail letters.  Those slots are approximately 12" wide and 1/2" high, with an angled opening.  Each bank of boxes has a couple of lockers, which the mail carrier can lock small packages in, leaving the key in your mailbox.</p>

<p>I haven't heard of this kind of mail theft.  It seems like a complete shot in the dark that someone would get something worthwhile.  Most people rarely send checks anymore.</p>

<p>Our neighborhood has a much bigger problem with package theft off people's front porches.  This applies to USPS, UPS, FedEX, Amazon, etc.</p>

<p>@Rick Lobrecht</p>

<p>Mail thieves regularly hit community mailbox clusters to steal outgoing mail.  Especially during the holidays, but anytime throughout the year grandma can be mailing out a gift card or cash.  One favorite are paper checks, which can be "washed" and the re-written.</p>

<p>I never used my community mailbox cluster for any outgoing mail of importance.  A few years ago I sent out a mail merge for 20 or so new "hams" (amateur radio operators) inviting them to the next upcoming local club meeting.</p>

<p>A few weeks later I got a letter from the local police department saying they had property of mine down at their evidence facility.  I was puzzled what it was.  Turns out it was this mail, which someone had stolen.  No value, except I was out the 20 or so stamps plus the folks didn't get a timely congratulations and invite.</p>

<p>The other problem we've had is thieves somehow making or duplicating the main cluster key.  Then they just take all of the mail, including outgoing.  This is usually done late at night or in the wee hours so no one will see them.  So, never leave mail in the cluster overnight, and if you're going to be gone have a mail hold put in place.</p>

<p>They can add a laser movement checker that checks movement of object inside of entrance of mailbox. If the object moves backwards ( I mean down to up) instead of forwards (up to down), it should have a auto lock system or warning by SMS, sound and etc. </p>

</p>
<p>In the 1963 film "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057616/" rel="nofollow">Un drÃ´le de paroissien</a>" (EN: "Heaven Sent") by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006620/" rel="nofollow">Jean-Pierre Mocky</a>, the character played by actor Bourvil is a member of the aristocracy for whom working is beneath his dignity. But after the French revolution living off your serfs became a little bit complicated, and his family was in dire straights, with almost every piece of furniture pawned, and no electricity.</p>

<p>So he goes to church to get advice from God, who sends him a sign: thou shalt help yourself to the offering boxes. They are there for the poor, and you are poor, so this isn't theft. (There is a strong taste of Jesuit casuistic...)</p>

<p>With that revelation, George runs home, to dedicate himself to his new vocation.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/j3SUHg5q4oQ?t=703" rel="nofollow">In the sequence from @ 11'43"</a>, he rips his own mailbox for the wall to use as training material, and in the next minutes he perfects his skills. He begins with caramels on strings, and by end of the film he prepares the boxes for faster service by sawing off their top and installing additional hinges, while ridiculing the police (which doesn't really need any help in that area).</p>

<p>I checked whether the USPS had any interesting innovations in  mailboxes. Nothing worth mentioning, but I incidentally came across this <a href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&NR=2019051079A1&KC=A1&FT=D&ND=3&date=20190214&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_ep" rel="nofollow">2017 filing published a few weeks ago</a>, called "CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY TRACKED AND SECURED VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEM". Blockchain is of course mentioned. Besides the technical aspects, which I don't really have time to delve into, I'm curious as to what their business model would be. A federal service provider to states and local governments?<br />

<p>I've read this whole page and only at the end suddenly realised you are not talking about mail boxes at your house.  Which I assumed all had 'shark teeth' style slots. picking the lock sounds like exponentially less effort.  You are talking about a post box - the kind the postperson attends on the bicylce or motorbike to retrieve the large quantity of motherlode in a big sack, once or twice a day. Added to the confusion is I understand the US has a system whereby one can send outgoing mail from ones own personal letter box, by raising the red flag. Or is that just in the pictures?</p>

<p>maybe this was the real intention of the IRA and pillar boxes in London. <br />
Quick access to grannies christmas cards, perhaps a winning sweepstakes ticket sent off by the claimant.<br />

<p>My neighborhood of northeastern Queens, NY has been struggling with an epidemic of this for more than a year. It's been a constant refrain of the local precincts' crime prevention teams to post valuable mail from inside the P.O. only, and the rollout of upgraded mailboxes is in full effect. <a href="https://qns.com/story/2018/07/09/residents-urged-not-use-usps-mailboxes-mail-thefts-reported-bayside-little-neck/" rel="nofollow">QNS.com</a></p>

<p>Amusingly, it was apparently so lucrative an undertaking around here that some thieves decided the whole "fishing" schtick was a waste of valuable time. They pulled together a few strong guys and a van so they could just rip the whole box off the sidewalk and drive away with it. Points for chutzpah, but <a href="https://patch.com/new-york/foresthills/perps-caught-stealing-usps-mailbox-forest-hills-police-say" rel="nofollow">it didn't work</a>.</p>

<p>re: The crime has become more common in the past few years.<br />
How common? The linked article has zero metrics. Isn't security supposed to balance risk against cost? Further - Does USPS *really* intend to mitigate this by wholesale replacement of mail boxes? How many millions will that cost? Per Baba K: If the magnitude really does require the issue to be addressed (again, no metrics,) surely existing mailboxes could be modified. If the suggestion of a "motion direction detector" is infeasible (I do like it, but wonder what should happen next, after "anti-peristalsis" is detected :) it would seem ridiculously cheap and easy to retrofit a smaller slot that would allow letters only. </p>

<p>@VinnyG<br />
Very few people use letters as a means of communication anymore, which means the proportion of mail containing bills is much higher now. So assuming a similar risk per letter stolen now vs then, we can assume that the risk/reward is much better now.</p>

</p>
<p>Surely there's an operational solution to this.<br />
If the postperson collect mail at say 18hrs, only mail deposited after that time is going to be stolen - given that thieves strike in the tiny hours.  The thieves can only steal after hours deposits. <br />
A sliding deadbolt by the postperson could secure the hatch on mail collection preventing deposits, and open it again at 07hrs. Only one mail collection a day for at risk boxes. <br />
Rip out all the boxes and have secure walk-in rooms a la ATM'S for after hours posting. That would be cheaper than hi-tech implementation </p>

<p>Change your mail delivery as follows. Have the mail delivered by persons unknown at times unknown in a thickly stuffed unmarked manila envelope directly to an apparently beat-up, disused, rusty mail box, at the edge of an unkempt, weed strewn yard, surrounding a decrepit apparently abandoned house, with a good number of large trees. There should be a yellow chalk mark somewhere on the fence. If the loose metal fence gate is hanging by one hinge and makes gentle creaking sounds, so much the better. Pick up your mail at 2 am. Be driving an early fifties American make car, black in color (the delivery should also be made using a black car) . Make sure you're not followed. Leave expeditiously.</p>

<p>@ Peter re: "Very few people use letters as a means of communication anymore..." Plausible. I would need to see a statistical analysis of types of mail deposited in street corner USPS boxes before completely agreeing with your proposition, however. On the other hand, I suspect that such an analysis might indicate that those boxes no longer serve any compelling purpose of any kind, which would ensure  that you will never see it...</p>

	    <p>It seems that someone from a company called Swift Recovery Ltd. is impersonating me -- at least on Telegram. The person is using a photo of me, and is using details of my life available on Wikipedia to convince people that they are me.</p>

<p>They are not.</p>

<p>If anyone has any more information -- stories, screen shots of chats, etc. -- please forward them to me.<br />

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011947"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/using_gmail_dot.html">Using Gmail "Dot Addresses" to Commit Fraud</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>In Gmail addresses, the dots don't matter. The account "bruceschneier@gmail.com" maps to the exact same address as "bruce.schneier@gmail.com" and "b.r.u.c.e.schneier@gmail.com" -- and so on. (Note: I own none of those addresses, if they are actually valid.)</p>

<p>This fact can be used <a href="https://www.agari.com/email-security-blog/bec-actors-exploit-google-dot-feature/">to commit fraud</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Recently, we observed a group of BEC actors make extensive use of Gmail dot accounts to commit a large and diverse amount of fraud.  Since early 2018, this group has used this fairly simple tactic to facilitate the following fraudulent activities:

<ul><li>Submit 48 credit card applications at four US-based financial institutions, resulting in the approval of at least $65,000 in fraudulent credit
<li>Register for 14 trial accounts with a commercial sales leads service to collect targeting data for BEC attacks
<li>File 13 fraudulent tax returns with an online tax filing service
<li>Submit 12 change of address requests with the US Postal Service
<li>Submit 11 fraudulent Social Security benefit applications
<li>Apply for unemployment benefits under nine identities in a large US state
<li>Submit applications for FEMA disaster assistance under three identities </ul>

<p>In each case, the scammers created multiple accounts on each website within a short period of time, modifying the placement of periods in the email address for each account.  Each of these accounts is associated with a different stolen identity, but all email from these services are received by the same Gmail account. Thus, the group is able to centralize and organize their fraudulent activity around a small set of email accounts, thereby increasing productivity and making it easier to continue their fraudulent behavior.</p></blockquote>

<p>This isn't a new trick. It has been <a href="https://jameshfisher.com/2018/04/07/the-dots-do-matter-how-to-scam-a-gmail-user.html">previously documented</a> as a way to trick Netflix users.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/users-report-losing-bitcoin-in-clever-hack-of-electrum-wallets/">This</a> is clever:</p>

<blockquote><p>How the attack works:

<ul><li>Attacker added tens of malicious servers to the Electrum wallet network.
<li>Users of legitimate Electrum wallets initiate a Bitcoin transaction.
<li>If the transaction reaches one of the malicious servers, these servers reply with an error message that urges users to download a wallet app update from a malicious website (GitHub repo).</li><li>User clicks the link and downloads the <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/370a9a9759154c2c9ec6d224462907184a5b283a8ff0cb3b316fd3ffb2df6aaa/detection">malicious update</a>.
<li>When the user opens the malicious Electrum wallet, the app asks the user for a two-factor authentication (2FA) code. This is a red flag, as these 2FA codes are only requested before sending funds, and not at wallet startup.
<li>The malicious Electrum wallet uses the 2FA code to steal the user's funds and transfer them to the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/14MVEf1X4Qmrpxx6oASqzYzJQZUwwG7Fb5">attacker's Bitcoin addresses</a>.</ul>

<p>The problem here is that Electrum servers are allowed to trigger popups with custom text inside users' wallets.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011893"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/12/massive_ad_frau.html">Massive Ad Fraud Scheme Relied on BGP Hijacking</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>This is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/12/how-3ves-bgp-hijackers-eluded-the-internet-and-made-29m/">really interesting story</a> of an ad fraud scheme that relied on hijacking the Border Gateway Protocol:</p>

<blockquote><p>Members of 3ve (pronounced "eve") used their large reservoir of trusted IP addresses to conceal a fraud that otherwise would have been easy for advertisers to detect. The scheme employed a thousand servers hosted inside data centers to impersonate real human beings who purportedly "viewed" ads that were hosted on bogus pages run by the scammers themselvesÂ­ -- who then received a check from ad networks for these billions of fake ad impressions. Normally, a scam of this magnitude coming from such a small pool of server-hosted bots would have stuck out to defrauded advertisers. To camouflage the scam, 3ve operators funneled the servers' fraudulent page requests through millions of compromised IP addresses.

<p>About one million of those IP addresses belonged to computers, primarily based in the US and the UK, that attackers had infected with botnet software strains known as Boaxxe and Kovter. But at the scale employed by 3ve, not even that number of IP addresses was enough. And that's where the BGP hijacking came in. The hijacking gave 3ve a nearly <i>limitless</i> supply of high-value IP addresses. Combined with the botnets, the ruse made it seem like millions of real people from some of the most affluent parts of the world were viewing the ads.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lots of details in the article.</p>

<p>An aphorism I often use in my talks is "expertise flows downhill: today's top-secret NSA programs become tomorrow's PhD theses and the next day's hacking tools." This is an example of that. BGP hacking -- known as "<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/07/more_on_the_nsa_2.html">traffic shaping</a>" inside the NSA -- has <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/10/chinas_hacking_.html">long been a tool</a> of national intelligence agencies. Now it is being used by cybercriminals.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (1/2): Classified NSA presentation on "<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2919677-Network-Shaping-101.html">network shaping</a>." I don't know if there is a difference inside the NSA between the two terms.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011885"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/12/fraudulent_tact.html">Fraudulent Tactics on Amazon Marketplace</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Fascinating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement">article</a> about the many ways Amazon Marketplace sellers sabotage each other and defraud customers. The opening example: framing a seller for false advertising by buying fake five-star reviews for their products.</p>

<blockquote><p>Defacement: Sellers armed with the accounts of Amazon distributors (sometimes legitimately, sometimes through the black market) can make all manner of changes to a rival's listings, from changing images to altering text to reclassifying a product into an irrelevant category, like "sex toys."

<p>Phony fires: Sellers will buy their rival's product, light it on fire, and post a picture to the reviews, claiming it exploded. Amazon is quick to suspend sellers for safety claims.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Over the following days, Harris came to realize that someone had been targeting him for almost a year, preparing an intricate trap. While he had trademarked his watch and registered his brand, Dead End Survival, with Amazon, Harris hadn't trademarked the name of his Amazon seller account, SharpSurvival. So the interloper did just that, submitting to the patent office as evidence that he owned the goods a photo taken from Harris' Amazon listings, including one of Harris' own hands lighting a fire using the clasp of his survival watch. The hijacker then took that trademark to Amazon and registered it, giving him the power to kick Harris off his own listings and commandeer his name.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>There are more subtle methods of sabotage as well. Sellers will sometimes buy Google ads for their competitors for unrelated products -- say, a dog food ad linking to a shampoo listing -- so that Amazon's algorithm sees the rate of clicks converting to sales drop and automatically demotes their product.</p></blockquote>

<p>What's also interesting is how Amazon is basically its own government -- with its own rules that its suppliers have no choice but to follow. And, of course, increasingly there is no option but to sell your stuff on Amazon. </p>

	    <p>The FBI <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/two-international-cybercriminal-rings-dismantled-and-eight-defendants-indicted-causing">announced</a> that it dismantled a large Internet advertising fraud network, and arrested eight people:</p>

<blockquote><p>A 13-count indictment was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging Aleksandr Zhukov, Boris Timokhin, Mikhail Andreev, Denis Avdeev, Dmitry Novikov, Sergey Ovsyannikov, Aleksandr Isaev and Yevgeniy Timchenko with criminal violations for their involvement in perpetrating widespread digital advertising fraud.  The charges include wire fraud, computer intrusion, aggravated identity theft and money laundering.  Ovsyannikov was arrested last month in Malaysia; Zhukov was arrested earlier this month in Bulgaria; and Timchenko was arrested earlier this month in Estonia, all pursuant to provisional arrest warrants issued at the request of the United States. They await extradition.  The remaining defendants are at large.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>On November 4, 2016, the hacker "Guccifer 2.0," a front for Russia's military intelligence service, <a href="https://guccifer2.wordpress.com/2016/11/04/info-from-inside-the-fec-the-democrats-may-rig-the-elections/">claimed</a> in a blogpost that the Democrats were likely to use vulnerabilities to hack the presidential elections. On November 9, 2018, President Donald Trump started tweeting about the senatorial elections in Florida and Arizona. Without any evidence whatsoever, he said that Democrats were trying to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1060938144336367616">steal the election</a> through "FRAUD."</p>

<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3015680">Cybersecurity experts</a> <a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/watts_webreadypdf.pdf">would say</a> that posts like Guccifer 2.0's are intended to undermine public confidence in voting: a cyber-attack against the US democratic system. Yet Donald Trump's actions are doing far more damage to democracy. So far, his tweets on the topic have been retweeted over 270,000 times, eroding confidence far more effectively than any foreign influence campaign.</p>

<p>We need new ideas to explain how public statements on the Internet can weaken American democracy. Cybersecurity today is not only about computer systems. It's also about the ways attackers can use computer systems to manipulate and undermine public expectations about democracy. Not only do we need to rethink attacks against democracy; we also need to rethink the attackers as well.</p>

<p>This is one key reason why we wrote a <a href="http://henryfarrell.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SSRN-id3273111.pdf">new research paper</a> which uses ideas from computer security to understand the relationship between democracy and information. These ideas help us understand attacks which destabilize confidence in democratic institutions or debate.</p>

<p>Our research implies that insider attacks from within American politics can be more pernicious than attacks from other countries. They are more sophisticated, employ tools that are harder to defend against, and lead to harsh political tradeoffs. The US can threaten charges or impose sanctions when Russian trolling agencies attack its democratic system. But what punishments can it use when the attacker is the US president?</p>

<p>People who think about cybersecurity build on ideas about confrontations between states during the Cold War. Intellectuals such as Thomas Schelling developed deterrence theory, which explained how the US and USSR could maneuver to limit each other's options without ever actually going to war. Deterrence theory, and related concepts about the relative ease of attack and defense, seemed to explain the tradeoffs that the US and rival states faced, as they started to use cyber techniques to probe and compromise each others' information networks.</p>

<p>However, these ideas fail to acknowledge one key differences between the Cold War and today. Nearly all states -- whether democratic or authoritarian -- are entangled on the Internet. This creates both new tensions and new opportunities. The US assumed that the internet would help spread American liberal values, and that this was a good and uncontroversial thing. Illiberal states like Russia and China feared that Internet freedom was a direct threat to their own systems of rule. Opponents of the regime might use social media and online communication to coordinate among themselves, and appeal to the broader public, perhaps toppling their governments, as happened in Tunisia during the Arab Spring.</p>

<p>This led illiberal states to develop new domestic defenses against open information flows. As scholars like <a href="http://www.margaretroberts.net/">Molly Roberts</a> have shown, states like China and Russia discovered how they could &quot;flood&quot; internet discussion with online nonsense and distraction, making it impossible for their opponents to talk to each other, or even to distinguish between truth and falsehood. These flooding techniques stabilized authoritarian regimes, because they demoralized and confused the regime's opponents. Libertarians often argue that the best antidote to bad speech is more speech. What Vladimir Putin discovered was that the best antidote to more speech was bad speech.</p>

<p>Russia saw the Arab Spring and efforts to encourage democracy in its neighborhood as direct threats, and began experimenting with counter-offensive techniques. When a Russia-friendly government in Ukraine collapsed due to popular protests, Russia tried to destabilize new, democratic elections by hacking the system through which the election results would be announced. The <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2852461">clear intention</a> was to discredit the election results by announcing fake voting numbers that would throw public discussion into disarray.</p>

<p>This attack on public confidence in election results was thwarted at the last moment. Even so, it provided the model for a new kind of attack. Hackers don't have to secretly alter people's votes to affect elections. All they need to do is to damage public confidence that the votes were counted fairly. As researchers <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2852461">have argued</a>, "simply put, the attacker might not care who wins; the losing side believing that the election was stolen from them may be equally, if not more, valuable."</p>

<p>These two kinds of attacks -- "flooding" attacks aimed at destabilizing public discourse, and "confidence" attacks aimed at undermining public belief in elections -- were weaponized against the US in 2016. Russian social media trolls, hired by the "Internet Research Agency," flooded online political discussions with rumors and counter-rumors in order to create confusion and political division. Peter Pomerantsev <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-True-Everything-Possible-Surreal/dp/1610396006">describes</a> how in Russia, "one moment [Putin's media wizard] Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West." Similarly, Russian trolls tried to get Black Lives Matter protesters and anti-Black Lives Matter protesters to march at the same time and place, to create conflict and the appearance of chaos. Guccifer 2.0's blog post was surely intended to undermine confidence in the vote, preparing the ground for a wider destabilization campaign after Hillary Clinton won the election. Neither Putin nor anyone else anticipated that Trump would win, ushering in chaos on a vastly greater scale.</p>

<p>We do not know how successful these attacks were. A <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11084.html">new book</a> by John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck suggests that Russian efforts had no measurable long-term consequences. <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624">Detailed research</a> on the flow of news articles through social media by Yochai Benker, Robert Farris, and Hal Roberts agrees, showing that Fox News was far more influential in the spread of false news stories than any Russian effort.</p>

<p>However, global adversaries like the Russians aren't the only actors who can use flooding and confidence attacks. US actors can use just the same techniques. Indeed, they can arguably use them better, since they have a better understanding of US politics, more resources, and are far more difficult for the government to counter without raising First Amendment issues.</p>

<p>For example, when the Federal Communication Commission asked for comments on its proposal to get rid of "net neutrality," it was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/many-comments-critical-of-fiduciary-rule-are-fake-1514370601">flooded by fake comments</a> supporting the proposal. Nearly every <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/blogs/FilteringOutTheBotsUnique2017NetNeutralityComments.pdf">real person who commented</a> was in favor of net neutrality, but their arguments were drowned out by a flood of spurious comments purportedly made by identities stolen from porn sites, by people whose names and email addresses had been harvested without their permission, and, in some cases, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evg3xw/dead-people-are-posting-anti-net-neutrality-comments-to-the-fcc-website">from dead people</a>. This was done not just to generate fake support for the FCC's controversial proposal. It was to devalue public comments in general, making the general public's support for net neutrality politically irrelevant. FCC decision making on issues like net neutrality used to be dominated by industry insiders, and many would like to go back to the old regime.</p>

<p>Trump's efforts to undermine confidence in the Florida and Arizona votes work on a much larger scale. There are clear short-term benefits to asserting fraud where no fraud exists. This may sway judges or other public officials to make concessions to the Republicans to preserve their legitimacy. Yet they also destabilize American democracy in the long term. If Republicans are convinced that Democrats win by cheating, they will feel that their own manipulation of the system (by purging voter rolls, making voting more difficult and so on) are legitimate, and very probably cheat even more flagrantly in the future. This will trash collective institutions and leave everyone worse off.</p>

<p>It is notable that some Arizonan Republicans -- including Martha McSally -- have so far stayed firm against pressure from the White House and the Republican National Committee to claim that cheating is happening. They presumably see more long term value from preserving existing institutions than undermining them. Very plausibly, Donald Trump has exactly the opposite incentives. By weakening public confidence in the vote today, he makes it easier to claim fraud and perhaps plunge American politics into chaos if he is defeated in 2020.</p>

<p>If experts who see Russian flooding and confidence measures as cyberattacks on US democracy are right, then these attacks are just as dangerous -- and perhaps more dangerous -- when they are used by domestic actors. The risk is that over time they will destabilize American democracy so that it comes closer to Russia's managed democracy -- where nothing is real any more, and ordinary people feel a mixture of paranoia, helplessness and disgust when they think about politics. Paradoxically, Russian interference is far too ineffectual to get us there -- but domestically mounted attacks by all-American political actors might.</p>

<p>To protect against that possibility, we need to start thinking more systematically about the relationship between democracy and information. <a href="http://henryfarrell.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SSRN-id3273111.pdf">Our paper</a> provides one way to do this, highlighting the vulnerabilities of democracy against certain kinds of information attack. More generally, we need to build levees against flooding while shoring up public confidence in voting and other public information systems that are necessary to democracy.</p>

<p>The first may require radical changes in how we regulate social media companies. Modernization of government commenting platforms to make them robust against flooding is only a very minimal first step. Up until very recently, companies like Twitter have won market advantage from bot infestations -- even when it couldn't make a profit, it seemed that user numbers were growing. CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg have begun to worry about democracy, but their worries will likely only go so far. It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his business model depends on not understanding it. Sharp -- and legally enforceable -- limits on automated accounts are a first step. Radical redesign of networks and of trending indicators so that flooding attacks are less effective may be a second.</p>

<p>The second requires general standards for voting at the federal level, and a constitutional guarantee of the right to vote. Technical experts <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2018/04/american_elections_a.html">nearly universally favor</a> robust voting systems that would combine paper records with random post-election auditing, to prevent fraud and secure public confidence in voting. Other steps to ensure proper ballot design, and standardize vote counting and reporting will take more time and discussion -- yet the record of other countries show that they are not impossible.</p>

<p>The US is nearly unique among major democracies in the persistent flaws of its election machinery. Yet voting is not the only important form of democratic information. Apparent efforts to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/28/17168048/census-citizenship-2020-immigrants-count-trump-lawsuit">deliberately skew</a> the US census against counting undocumented immigrants show the need for a more general audit of the political information systems that we need if democracy is to function properly.</p>

<p>It's easier to respond to Russian hackers through sanctions, counter-attacks and the like than to domestic political attacks that undermine US democracy. To preserve the basic political freedoms of democracy requires recognizing that these freedoms are sometimes going to be abused by politicians such as Donald Trump. The best that we can do is to minimize the possibilities of abuse up to the point where they encroach on basic freedoms and harden the general institutions that secure democratic information against attacks intended to undermine them.</p>

<p>This essay was co-authored with Henry Farrell, and <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbyg3x/the-most-damaging-election-disinformation-campaign-came-from-donald-trump-not-russia">previously appeared</a> on Motherboard, with a terrible headline that I was unable to get changed.</p>

	    <p>A new study <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/11/05/credit-card-chips-fail-to-halt-fraud-survey-says/">finds</a> that credit card fraud has not declined since the introduction of chip cards in the US. The majority of stolen card information comes from hacked point-of-sale terminals.</p>

<p>The reasons seem to be twofold. One, the US uses chip-and-signature instead of chip-and-PIN, obviating the most critical security benefit of the chip. And two, US merchants still accept magnetic stripe cards, meaning that thieves can steal credentials from a chip card and create a working cloned mag stripe card.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/these-new-tricks-can-outsmart-deepfake-videosfor-now/">This story</a> nicely illustrates the arms race between technologies to create fake videos and technologies to detect fake videos:</p>

<blockquote><p>These fakes, while convincing if you watch a few seconds on a phone screen, aren't perfect (yet). They contain tells, like creepily ever-open eyes, from flaws in their creation process. In looking into DeepFake's guts, Lyu realized that the images that the program learned from didn't include many with closed eyes (after all, you wouldn't keep a selfie where you were blinking, would you?). "This becomes a bias," he says. The neural network doesn't <i>get</i> blinking. Programs also might miss other "physiological signals intrinsic to human beings," says Lyu's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02877.pdf">paper</a> on the phenomenon, such as breathing at a normal rate, or having a pulse. (Autonomic signs of constant existential distress are not listed.) While this research focused specifically on videos created with this particular software, it is a truth universally acknowledged that even a large set of snapshots might not adequately capture the physical human experience, and so any software trained on those images may be found lacking.

<p>Lyu's blinking revelation revealed a lot of fakes. But a few weeks after his team put a draft of their paper online, they got anonymous emails with links to deeply faked YouTube videos whose stars opened and closed their eyes more normally. The fake content creators had evolved.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't know who will win this arms race, if there ever will be a winner. But the problem with fake videos goes deeper: they affect people even if they are later told that they are fake, and there always will be people that will believe they are real, despite any evidence to the contrary.</p>

	    <p>BuzzFeed is <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/how-a-massive-ad-fraud-scheme-exploited-android-phones-to">reporting</a> on a scheme where fraudsters buy legitimate Android apps, track users' behavior in order to mimic it in a way that evades bot detectors, and then uses bots to perpetuate an ad-fraud scheme.</p>

<blockquote><p>After being provided with a list of the apps and websites connected to the scheme, Google investigated and found that dozens of the apps used its mobile advertising network. Its independent analysis confirmed the presence of a botnet driving traffic to websites and apps in the scheme. Google has removed more than 30 apps from the Play store, and terminated multiple publisher accounts with its ad networks. Google said that prior to being contacted by BuzzFeed News it had previously removed 10 apps in the scheme and blocked many of the websites. It continues to investigate, and <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/10/google-tackles-new-ad-fraud-scheme.html">published a blog post</a> to detail its findings.

<p>The company estimates this operation stole close to $10 million from advertisers who used Google's ad network to place ads in the affected websites and apps. It said the vast majority of ads being placed in these apps and websites came via other major ad networks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lots of details in both the BuzzFeed and the Google links.</p>

<p>The Internet advertising industry is rife with fraud, at all levels. This is just one scheme among many.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011969"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/cybersecurity_f_1.html">Cybersecurity for the Public Interest</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The Crypto Wars have been waging off-and-on for a quarter-century. On one side is law enforcement, which wants to be able to break encryption, to access devices and communications of terrorists and criminals. On the other are almost every cryptographer and computer security expert, repeatedly explaining that there's no way to provide this capability without also weakening the security of every user of those devices and communications systems.</p>

<p>It's an impassioned debate, acrimonious at times, but there are real technologies that can be brought to bear on the problem: key-escrow technologies, code obfuscation technologies, and backdoors with different properties. Pervasive surveillance capitalism -- Â­as practiced by the Internet companies that are already spying on everyoneÂ­ -- matters. So does society's underlying security needs. There is a security benefit to giving access to law enforcement, even though it would inevitably and invariably also give that access to others. However, there is also a security benefit of having these systems protected from all attackers, including law enforcement. These benefits are mutually exclusive. Which is more important, and to what degree?</p>

<p>The problem is that almost no policymakers are discussing this policy issue from a technologically informed perspective, and very few technologists truly understand the policy contours of the debate. The result is both sides consistently talking past each other, and policy proposals -- Â­that occasionally become lawÂ­ -- that are technological disasters.</p>

<p>This isn't sustainable, either for this issue or any of the other policy issues surrounding Internet security. We need policymakers who understand technology, but we also need cybersecurity technologists who understandÂ­ -- and are involved in -- Â­policy. We need public-interest technologists.</p>

<p>Let's pause at that term. The Ford Foundation defines public-interest technologists as "technology practitioners who focus on social justice, the common good, and/or the public interest." A group of academics recently wrote that public-interest technologists are people who "study the application of technology expertise to advance the public interest, generate public benefits, or promote the public good." Tim Berners-Lee has called them "philosophical engineers." I think of public-interest technologists as people who combine their technological expertise with a public-interest focus: by working on tech policy, by working on a tech project with a public benefit, or by working as a traditional technologist for an organization with a public benefit. Maybe it's not the best termÂ­ -- and I know not everyone likes itÂ­ -- but it's a decent umbrella term that can encompass all these roles.</p>

<p>We need public-interest technologists in policy discussions. We need them on congressional staff, in federal agencies, at non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in academia, inside companies, and as part of the press. In our field, we need them to get involved in not only the Crypto Wars, but everywhere cybersecurity and policy touch each other: the vulnerability equities debate, election security, cryptocurrency policy, Internet of Things safety and security, big data, algorithmic fairness, adversarial machine learning, critical infrastructure, and national security. When you broaden the definition of Internet security, many additional areas fall within the intersection of cybersecurity and policy. Our particular expertise and way of looking at the world is critical for understanding a great many technological issues, such as net neutrality and the regulation of critical infrastructure. I wouldn't want to formulate public policy about artificial intelligence and robotics without a security technologist involved.</p>

<p>Public-interest technology isn't new. Many organizations are working in this area, from older organizations like EFF and EPIC to newer ones like Verified Voting and Access Now. Many academic classes and programs combine technology and public policy. My cybersecurity policy class at the Harvard Kennedy School is just one example. Media startups like The Markup are doing technology-driven journalism. There are even programs and initiatives related to public-interest technology inside for-profit corporations.</p>

<p>This might all seem like a lot, but it's really not. There aren't enough people doing it, there aren't enough people who know it needs to be done, and there aren't enough places to do it. We need to build a world where there is a viable career path for public-interest technologists.</p>

<p>There are many barriers. There's a report titled A Pivotal Moment that includes this quote: "While we cite individual instances of visionary leadership and successful deployment of technology skill for the public interest, there was a consensus that a stubborn cycle of inadequate supply, misarticulated demand, and an inefficient marketplace stymie progress."</p>

<p>That quote speaks to the three places for intervention. One: the supply side. There just isn't enough talent to meet the eventual demand. This is especially acute in cybersecurity, which has a talent problem across the field. Public-interest technologists are a diverse and multidisciplinary group of people. Their backgrounds come from technology, policy, and law. We also need to foster diversity within public-interest technology; the populations using the technology must be represented in the groups that shape the technology. We need a variety of ways for people to engage in this sphere: ways people can do it on the side, for a couple of years between more traditional technology jobs, or as a full-time rewarding career. We need public-interest technology to be part of every core computer-science curriculum, with "clinics" at universities where students can get a taste of public-interest work. We need technology companies to give people sabbaticals to do this work, and then value what they've learned and done.</p>

<p>Two: the demand side. This is our biggest problem right now; not enough organizations understand that they need technologists doing public-interest work. We need jobs to be funded across a wide variety of NGOs. We need staff positions throughout the government: executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. President Obama's US Digital Service should be expanded and replicated; so should Code for America. We need more press organizations that perform this kind of work.</p>

<p>Three: the marketplace. We need job boards, conferences, and skills exchangesÂ­ -- places where people on the supply side can learn about the demand.</p>

<p>Major foundations are starting to provide funding in this space: the Ford and MacArthur Foundations in particular, but others as well.</p>

<p>This problem in our field has an interesting parallel with the field of public-interest law. In the 1960s, there was no such thing as public-interest law. The field was deliberately created, funded by organizations like the Ford Foundation. They financed legal aid clinics at universities, so students could learn housing, discrimination, or immigration law. They funded fellowships at organizations like the ACLU and the NAACP. They created a world where public-interest law is valued, where all the partners at major law firms are expected to have done some public-interest work. Today, when the ACLU advertises for a staff attorney, paying one-third to one-tenth normal salary, it gets hundreds of applicants. Today, 20% of Harvard Law School graduates go into public-interest law, and the school has soul-searching seminars because that percentage is so low. Meanwhile, the percentage of computer-science graduates going into public-interest work is basically zero.</p>

<p>This is bigger than computer security. Technology now permeates society in a way it didn't just a couple of decades ago, and governments move too slowly to take this into account. That means technologists now are relevant to all sorts of areas that they had no traditional connection to: climate change, food safety, future of work, public health, bioengineering.</p>

<p>More generally, technologists need to understand the policy ramifications of their work. There's a pervasive myth in Silicon Valley that technology is politically neutral. It's not, and I hope most people reading this today knows that. We built a world where programmers felt they had an inherent right to code the world as they saw fit. We were allowed to do this because, until recently, it didn't matter. Now, too many issues are being decided in an unregulated capitalist environment where significant social costs are too often not taken into account.</p>

<p>This is where the core issues of society lie. The defining political question of the 20th century was: "What should be governed by the state, and what should be governed by the market?" This defined the difference between East and West, and the difference between political parties within countries. The defining political question of the first half of the 21st century is: "How much of our lives should be governed by technology, and under what terms?" In the last century, economists drove public policy. In this century, it will be technologists.</p>

<p>The future is coming faster than our current set of policy tools can deal with. The only way to fix this is to develop a new set of policy tools with the help of technologists. We need to be in all aspects of public-interest work, from informing policy to creating tools all building the future. The world needs all of our help.</p>

	    <p>Really interesting <a href="https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/jfq/jfq-92/jfq-92.pdf">article by and interview with</a> Paul M. Nakasone (Commander of US Cyber Command, Director of the National Security Agency, and Chief of the Central Security Service) in the current issue of <i>Joint Forces Quarterly</i>. He talks about the evolving role of US Cyber Command, and its new posture of "persistent engagement" using a "cyber-persistant force."</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>We must "defend forward" in cyberspace, as we do in the physical domains. Our naval forces do not defend by staying in port, and our airpower does not remain at airfields. They patrol the seas and skies to ensure they are positioned to defend our country before our borders are crossed. The same logic applies in cyberspace. Persistent engagement of our adversaries in cyberspace cannot be successful if our actions are limited to DOD networks. To defend critical military and national interests, our forces must operate against our enemies on their virtual territory as well. Shifting from a response outlook to a persistence force that defends forward moves our cyber capabilities out of their virtual garrisons, adopting a posture that matches the cyberspace operational environment.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the interview:</p>

<blockquote><p>As we think about cyberspace, we should agree on a few foundational concepts. First, our nation is in constant contact with its adversaries; we're not waiting for adversaries to come to us. Our adversaries understand this, and they are always working to improve that contact. Second, our security is challenged in cyberspace. We have to actively defend; we have to conduct reconnaissance; we have to understand where our adversary is and his capabilities; and we have to understand their intent. Third, superiority in cyberspace is temporary; we may achieve it for a period of time, but it's ephemeral. That's why we must operate continuously to seize and maintain the initiative in the face of persistent threats. Why do the threats persist in cyberspace? They persist because the barriers to entry are low and the capabilities are rapidly available and can be easily repurposed. Fourth, in this domain, the advantage favors those who have initiative. If we want to have an advantage in cyberspace, we have to actively work to either improve our defenses, create new accesses, or upgrade our capabilities. This is a domain that requires constant action because we're going to get reactions from our adversary.

<p>[...]</p>

<p><i>Persistent engagement</i> is the concept that states we are in constant contact with our adversaries in cyberspace, and success is determined by how we <i>enable</i> and <i>act</i>. In persistent engagement, we <i>enable</i> other interagency partners. Whether it's the FBI or DHS, we enable them with information or intelligence to share with elements of the CIKR [critical infrastructure and key resources] or with select private-sector companies. The recent midterm elections is an example of how we enabled our partners. As part of the Russia Small Group, USCYBERCOM and the National Security Agency [NSA] enabled the FBI and DHS to prevent interference and influence operations aimed at our political processes. Enabling our partners is two-thirds of persistent engagement. The other third rests with our ability to act -- that is, how we act against our adversaries in cyberspace. Acting includes defending forward. How do we warn, how do we influence our adversaries, how do we position ourselves in case we have to achieve outcomes in the future? Acting is the concept of operating outside our borders, being outside our networks, to ensure that we understand what our adversaries are doing. If we find ourselves defending inside our own networks, we have lost the initiative and the advantage. </p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The concept of persistent engagement has to be teamed with "persistent presence" and "persistent innovation." Persistent presence is what the Intelligence Community is able to provide us to better understand and track our adversaries in cyberspace. The other piece is persistent innovation. In the last couple of years, we have learned that capabilities rapidly change; accesses are tenuous; and tools, techniques, and tradecraft must evolve to keep pace with our adversaries. We rely on operational structures that are enabled with the rapid development of capabilities. Let me offer an example regarding the need for rapid change in technologies. Compare the air and cyberspace domains. Weapons like JDAMs [Joint Direct Attack Munitions] are an important armament for air operations. How long are those JDAMs good for? Perhaps 5, 10, or 15 years, some-times longer given the adversary. When we buy a capability or tool for cyberspace...we rarely get a prolonged use we can measure in years. Our capabilities rarely last 6 months, let alone 6 years. This is a big difference in two important domains of future conflict. Thus, we will need formations that have ready access to developers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Solely from a military perspective, these are obviously the right things to be doing. From a societal perspective -- from the perspective a potential arms race -- I'm much less sure. I'm also worried about the singular focus on nation-state actors in an environment where capabilities diffuse so quickly. But Cyber Command's job is not cybersecurity and resilience.</p>

<p>The whole thing is worth reading, regardless of whether you agree or disagree.</p>

	    <p>Our work in cybersecurity is inexorably intertwined with public policy andÂ­ -- more generallyÂ­ -- the public interest. It's obvious in the debates on encryption and vulnerability disclosure, but it's also part of the policy discussions about the Internet of Things, cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, social media platforms, and pretty much everything else related to IT.</p>

<p>This societal dimension to our traditionally technical area is bringing with it a need for public-interest technologists.</p>

<p>Defining this term is difficult. One <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/equals-change-blog/posts/5-reasons-you-might-be-a-public-interest-technologist/">blog post</a> described public-interest technologists as "technology practitioners who focus on social justice, the common good, and/or the public interest." A group of academics in this field wrote that "public-interest technology refers to the study and application of technology expertise to advance the public interest/generate public benefits/promote the public good."</p>

<p>I think of public-interest technologists as people who combine their technological expertise with a public-interest focus, either by working on tech policy (for the EFF or as a congressional staffer, as examples), working on a technology project with a public benefit (such as Tor or Signal), or working as a more traditional technologist for an organization with a public-interest focus (providing IT security for Human Rights Watch, as an example). Public-interest technology isn't one thing; it's many things. And not everyone likes the term. Maybe it's not the most accurate term for what different people do, but it's the best umbrella term that covers everyone.</p>

<p>It's a growing field -- one far broader than cybersecurity -- and one that I am increasingly focusing my time on. I maintain a <a href="https://public-interest-tech.com/">resources page</a> for public-interest technology. (<a href="https://www.netgainpartnership.org/resources/2018/1/26/a-pivotal-moment">This</a> is the single best document to read about the current state of public-interest technology, and what is still to be done.)</p>

<p>This year, <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/press/97/rsa-conference-and-bruce-schneier-to-host-first">I am bringing some of these ideas to the RSA Conference</a>. In <a href="/blogs/why-ford-foundation-is-helping-bruce-schneier-bring-a-new-field-to-rsa-conference-in-2019">partnership </a> with the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/campaigns/public-interest-tech/">Ford Foundation</a>, I am hosting a mini-track on public-interest technology. Six sessions throughout the day on Thursday will highlight different aspects of this important work. We'll look at public-interest technologists inside governments, as part of civil society, at universities, and in corporate environments.</p>

<ol><li><strong>How Public-Interest Technologists are Changing the World </strong>. This introductory panel lays the groundwork for the day to come. I'll be joined on stage with Matt Mitchell of Tactical Tech, and we'll discuss how public-interest technologists are already changing the world.</li>

<p><li><strong>Public-Interest Tech in Silicon Valley</strong>. Most of us work for technology companies, and this panel discusses public-interest technology work within companies. Mitchell Baker of Mozilla Corp. and Cindy Cohn of the EFF will lead the discussion, looking at both public-interest projects within corporations and employee activism initiatives by corporate employees.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Working in Civil Society.</strong> Bringing a technological perspective into civil society can transform how organizations do their work. Through a series of lightning talks, this session examines how this transformation can happen from a variety of perspectives: exposing government surveillance, protecting journalists worldwide, preserving a free and open Internet, bringing a security focus to artificial intelligence research, protecting NGO networks, and more. For those of us in security, bringing tech tools to those who need them is core to what we do.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Government Needs You.</strong> Government needs technologists at all levels. We're needed on legislative staffs and at regulatory agencies in order to make effective tech policy, but we're also needed elsewhere to implement policy more broadly. We're needed to advise courts, testify at hearings, and serve on advisory committees. At this session, you'll hear from public-interest technologists who have had a major impact on government from a variety of positions, and learn about ways you can get involved.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Changing Academia.</strong> Higher education needs to incorporate a public-interest perspective in technology departments, and a technology perspective in public-policy departments. This could look like ethics courses for computer science majors, programming for law students, or joint degrees that combine technology and social science. Danny Weitzner of MIT and Latanya Sweeney of Harvard will discuss efforts to build these sorts of interdisciplinary classes, programs, and institutes.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>The Future of Public-Interest Tech</strong> Creating an environment where public-interest technology can flourish will require a robust pipeline: more people wanting to go into this field, more places for them to go, and an improved market that matches supply with demand. In this closing session, Jenny Toomey of the Ford Foundation and I will sum up the day and discuss future directions for growing the field, funding trajectories, highlighting outstanding needs and gaps, and describing how you can get involved.</li></ol></p>

<p>Check <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19/agenda/bridging-the-gap-cybersecurity-public-interest-tech">here</a> for times and locations, and be sure to reserve your seat.</p>

<p>We all need to help. I don't mean that we all need to quit our jobs and go work on legislative staffs; there's a lot we can do while still maintaining our existing careers. We can advise governments and other public-interest organizations. We can agitate for the public interest inside the corporations we work for. We can speak at conferences and write opinion pieces for publication. We can teach part-time at all levels. But some of us will need to do this full-time.</p>

<p>There's an <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/building-a-new-field-of-public-interest-technology-lessons-learned-from-public-interest-law/">interesting parallel</a> to public-interest law, which covers everything from human-rights lawyers to public defenders. In the 1960s, that field didn't exist. The field was deliberately created, funded by organizations like the Ford Foundation. They created a world where public-interest law is valued. Today, when the ACLU advertises for a staff attorney, paying a third to a tenth of a normal salary, it gets hundreds of applicants. Today, 20% of Harvard Law School grads go into public-interest law, while the percentage of computer science grads doing public-interest work is basically zero. This is what we need to fix.</p>

<p>Please stop in at my mini-track. Come for a panel that interests you, or stay for the whole day. Bring your ideas. Find me to talk about this further. Pretty much all the major policy debates of this century will have a strong technological component -- and an important cybersecurity angle -- and we all need to get involved.</p>

	    <p>Good <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/opinion/cellphones-security-spying.html">essay</a> on the inherent vulnerabilities in the cell phone standards and the market barriers to fixing them.</p>

<blockquote><p>So far, industry and policymakers have largely dragged their feet when it comes to blocking cell-site simulators and SS7 attacks. Senator Ron Wyden, one of the few lawmakers vocal about this issue, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/24/fbi-surveillance-devices-may-interfere-with-calls-us-senator-says/">sent a letter in August</a> encouraging the Department of Justice to "be forthright with federal courts about the disruptive nature of cell-site simulators." No response has ever been published.

<p>The lack of action could be because it is a big task -- there are hundreds of companies and international bodies involved in the cellular network. The other reason could be that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have a vested interest in exploiting these same vulnerabilities. But law enforcement has other effective tools that are unavailable to criminals and spies. For example, the police can work directly with phone companies, serving warrants and Title III wiretap orders. In the end, eliminating these vulnerabilities is just as valuable for law enforcement as it is for everyone else.</p>

<p>As it stands, there is no government agency that has the power, funding and mission to fix the problems. Large companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Google and Apple have not been public about their efforts, if any exist.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011835"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/11/new_iot_securit.html">New IoT Security Regulations</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Due to ever-evolving technological advances, manufacturers are connecting consumer goodsÂ­ -- from toys to light bulbs to major appliancesÂ­ -- to the Internet at breakneck speeds. This is the Internet of Things, and it's a security nightmare.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things fuses products with communications technology to make daily life more effortless. Think Amazon's Alexa, which not only answers questions and plays music but allows you to control your home's lights and thermostat. Or the current generation of implanted pacemakers, which can both receive commands and send information to doctors over the Internet.</p>

<p>But like nearly all innovation, there are risks involved. And for products born out of the Internet of Things, this means the risk of having personal information stolen or devices being overtaken and controlled remotely. For devices that affect the world in a direct physical manner -- Â­cars, pacemakers, thermostatsÂ­ -- the risks include loss of life and property.</p>

<p>By developing more advanced security features and building them into these products, hacks can be avoided. The problem is that there is no monetary incentive for companies to invest in the cybersecurity measures needed to keep their products secure. Consumers will buy products without proper security features, unaware that their information is vulnerable. And current liability laws make it hard to hold companies accountable for shoddy software security.</p>

<p>It falls upon lawmakers to create laws that protect consumers. While the US government is largely absent in this area of consumer protection, the state of California has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17874768/california-iot-smart-device-cybersecurity-bill-sb-327-signed-law">stepped</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/30/california-connected-device-laws/">in</a> and started regulating the Internet of Things, or "IoT" devices sold in the stateÂ­ -- and the effects will soon be felt worldwide.</p>

<p>California's new <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327">SB 327 law</a>, which will take effect in January 2020, requires all "connected devices" to have a "reasonable security feature." The good news is that the term "connected devices" is broadly defined to include just about everything connected to the Internet. The not-so-good news is that "reasonable security" remains defined such that companies trying to avoid compliance can argue that the law is unenforceable.</p>

<p>The legislation requires that security features must be able to protect the device and the information on it from a variety of threats and be appropriate to both the nature of the device and the information it collects. California's attorney general will interpret the law and define the specifics, which will surely be the subject of much lobbying by tech companies.</p>

<p>There's just one specific in the law that's not subject to the attorney general's interpretation: default passwords are not allowed. This is a good thing; they are a terrible security practice. But it's just one of dozens of awful "security" measures commonly found in IoT devices.</p>

<p>This law is not a <a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/09/californias-bad-iot-law.html#.W-SaLNVKhhE">panacea</a>. But we have to start somewhere, and it is a start.</p>

<p>Though the legislation covers only the state of California, its effects will reach much further. All of usÂ­ -- in the United States or elsewhereÂ­ -- are likely to benefit because of the way software is written and sold.</p>

<p>Automobile manufacturers sell their cars worldwide, but they are customized for local markets. The car you buy in the United States is different from the same model <a href="https://www.export.gov/article?id=Mexico-Automotive-Parts-and-Supplies">sold in Mexico</a>, because the local environmental laws are not the same and manufacturers optimize engines based on where the product will be sold. The economics of building and selling automobiles easily allows for this differentiation.</p>

<p>But software is different. Once California forces minimum security standards on IoT devices, manufacturers will have to rewrite their software to comply. At that point, it won't make sense to have two versions: one for California and another for everywhere else. It's much easier to maintain the single, more secure version and sell it everywhere.</p>

<p>The European General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://eugdpr.org/">GDPR</a>), which implemented the annoying warnings and agreements that pop up on websites, is another example of a law that extends well beyond physical borders. You might have noticed an increase in websites that force you to acknowledge you've read and agreed to the website's privacy policies. This is because it is tricky to differentiate between users who are subject to the protections of the GDPRÂ­ -- people physically in the European Union, and EU citizens wherever they are -- Â­and those who are not. It's easier to extend the protection to everyone.</p>

<p>Once this kind of sorting is possible, companies will, in all likelihood, return to their profitable surveillance capitalism practices on those who are still fair game. Surveillance is still the primary business model of the Internet, and companies want to spy on us and our activities as much as they can so they can sell us more things and monetize what they know about our behavior.</p>

<p>Insecurity is profitable only if you can get away with it worldwide. Once you can't, you might as well make a virtue out of necessity. So everyone will benefit from the California regulation, as they would from similar security regulations enacted in any market around the world large enough to matter, just like everyone will <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3254511">benefit</a> from the portion of GDPR compliance that involves data security.</p>

<p>Most importantly, laws like these spur innovations in cybersecurity. Right now, we have a market failure. Because the courts have traditionally not held software manufacturers <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/114973/bad-code-should-software-makers-pay-part-1">liable for vulnerabilities</a>, and because consumers don't have the expertise to differentiate between a secure product and an insecure one, manufacturers have prioritized low prices, getting devices out on the market quickly and additional features over security.</p>

<p>But once a government steps in and imposes more stringent security regulations, companies have an incentive to meet those standards as quickly, cheaply, and effectively as possible. This means more security innovation, because now there's a market for new ideas and new products. We've seen this pattern again and again in safety and security engineering, and we'll see it with the Internet of Things as well.</p>

<p>IoT devices are more <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/01/the-internet-of-things-dangerous-future-bruce-schneier.html">dangerous</a> than our traditional computers because they sense the world around us, and affect that world in a direct physical manner. Increasing the cybersecurity of these devices is paramount, and it's heartening to see both individual states and the European Union step in where the US federal government is abdicating responsibility. But we need more, and soon.</p>

	<h2 class="entry" id="a011997">Programmers Who Don't Understand Security Are Poor at Security</h2>
	
	
		
	
    
	    <p>A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-shows-programmers-will-take-the-easy-way-out-and-not-implement-proper-password-security/">university study</a> confirmed the obvious: if you pay a random bunch of freelance programmers a small amount of money to write security software, they're not going to do a very good job at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>In an experiment that involved 43 programmers hired via the Freelancer.com platform, University of Bonn academics have discovered that developers tend to take the easy way out and write code that stores user passwords in an unsafe manner.

<p>For their study, the German academics asked a group of 260 Java programmers to write a user registration system for a fake social network.</p>

<p>Of the 260 developers, only 43 took up the job, which involved using technologies such as Java, JSF, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL to create the user registration component.</p>

<p>Of the 43, academics paid half of the group with â¬100, and the other half with â¬200, to determine if higher pay made a difference in the implementation of password security features.</p>

<p>Further, they divided the developer group a second time, prompting half of the developers to store passwords in a secure manner, and leaving the other half to store passwords in their preferred method -- hence forming four quarters of developers paid â¬100 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P100), developers paid â¬200 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P200), devs paid â¬100 but not prompted for password security (N100), and those paid â¬200 but not prompted for password security (N200).</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't know why anyone would expect this group of people to implement a good secure password system. Look at how they were hired. Look at the scope of the project. Look at what they were paid. I'm sure they grabbed the first thing they found on GitHub that did the job.</p>

<p>I'm not very impressed with the study or its conclusions.</p>

<blockquote>... showing that developers don't inherently think about security when writing code.</blockquote>

<p>Isn't this rather a demonstration of management failure? I.e., the specification is incomplete or non-existant, but the "Auftraggeber" implicitly expected the underling to make up for this.</p>

<p>Hex encoding is still not the worst possible option. </p>

<p>At a place I worked at, a critical application logged all mainframe interactions in a file visible to all users on the workstation. This included user credentials (why???), which were synchronised with the general Microsoft authentication system. Whoever wrote this garbage knew it wasn't quite a good idea, as the password was "encrypted": Caesar cipher with an offset of one, which isn't quite nearly as secure as ROT13.</p>

<p>Management was full of themselves with so-called PRINCE2 methodology, and shelves of binders full of charts and procedures, but in the end, the code grinder in Bucarest or Mumbai was on his own, and the finished product the real specification. I didn't have access to the source code, and reading decompiled Java byte code only made me dumber. I did have a copy of the holy grail, a sheet of paper photocopied by generations of monks from a medieval manuscript describing the fundamental business logic and transaction validation rules.</p>

<p>I don't think that paying a big management consultancy a 5 or 6 digit amount would have produced a much better result that the 100â¬ or 200â¬ charity raffle.<br />
 <br />
I'm interested in a new title from MIT Press, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/problem-software" rel="nofollow">Adam Barr: The Problem with Software -- Why Smart Engineers Write Bad Code</a>, but from the blurb and the few available excerpts I'm afraid I might be disappointed.</p>

<p>Several years ago I began writing RESTful applications, for which had to deal with the Oauth2 authorization mechanism. Trying to understand what I had to do, and why, I looked it up, and found  scathing criticisms of this "standard", and on how it was allegedly been watered down by industry from the first version. Basically, industry didn't want to have anything too complicated.</p>

<p>IIRC, the main gripe with Oauth2 was that it used implicitly TLS for a purpose for which it wasn't designed. The exchange of access credentials, which are sent <i>en clair</i> over the link is directly dependent on the presence of transport security, i.e., a valid certificate chain.</p>

<p>So the fish rots from the head, as they say.</p>

<p>Seriously? They expected someone to put forth the effort of security for $200?</p>

<p>this is what happens when a company goes i can get this software for â¬100 you are crazy quoting me â¬10,000 for something this simple. in-house developers have actual risks of losing their jobs freelancers do not. the faster they can ship something out the more money they can make. <br />

<p>I just got back from the University of Tulsa's cybersecurity conference, and the main theme there seemed to be that you _must_ seriously push security at all levels, all the time, or bad things will happen.  While the general speakers were fairly optimistic about things (ironically, this included FB's CSO, days after they leaked 200 million plaintext passwords), the speakers on the technical track (the USAF's head of security, several former CIA) were a lot more pessimistic about the current state of things.  Clearly someone in the IDF read "Ender's Game", because they seem to be taking the "find them as young as possible, and train them aggressively and early" approach.  Not quite pre-school level, but more than one speaker did mention that to truly prepare users for information security, you have to start teaching them as early as possible, so that the security mindset is fully internalized.  The insurance industry might end up being the ones to really start pushing security standards, since they will want to ensure that those they insure against security related losses are actually following good standards, and they will be the ones with the most to lose.</p>

<p>What a horrible study. Kinda makes a mockery of actual scientific research. I understand the push for more security inclined programming off the bat, but this seems like a heavy-handed way to deliver that message. </p>

<p>@TatÃ¼tata:</p>

<p>"Caesar cipher with an offset of one, which isn't quite nearly as secure as ROT13."</p>

<p>My goodness no, my manager told me Caesar is way more secure than ROT13, and they couldn't be wrong they get payed squillions more than me.</p>

<p>They said, you have to do Caesar 26 times in a row to get back to the 'plaintext' with ROT13 only twice. </p>

<p>Oh that and apparently Microsoft use ROT13 on every Windows OS instaled as the default in the registry as well...</p>

<p>Joking aside, that last bit is true,</p>

<p>Those who are focusing on the low pay and Freelancer.com are missing the point. The issue is systemic. I have seen it several times in-house, where programmers are making over $100K and fear to be fired. </p>

<p>If not defined on the requirements, most will store in plaintext. If the expectations are not set, most will use MD5 or SHA1. </p>

<p>This is industry knowledge not typically taught in most Computer Science programs, not all companies will pay $6k for a SANS class, governments are not regulating products based on these factors, and most startups will continue to use these services, which means, those that make it big into a component that the industry adopts or sell their product to a major competitor, came from this shaky foundations. </p>

<p>Food for thought.</p>

<p>As a developer myself, I am not really specificed with how this was conducted.<br />
Programming properly requires skill and experience.<br />
Only people with 5+ years can start to learn how to write code with decent security. And it takes years of refactoring and programming defensively to be able to somewhat get "good" quality (keeping in mind in principe that the question is not if you will be hacked, but that you will be hacked, and must have layers upon layers of security and be able to act while the attack is going through one of those layers).</p>

<p>Seriously. You grab people that are not even skilled enough from my point of view as programmers working outside of security code. And you ask them to write secure code ? What do you think is going ot happen ?</p>

<p>Because of this, I cannot take this thing seriously. Even less take anything from it of value.</p>

<p>If you want to know what writing code for securing things, go make interviews with Theo de Raadt or OpenBSD developers. They will show you that most security holes are first bugs, not security holes. Bugs that become exploited as security holes. But they are bugs, most of them.</p>

<p>Then, that it takes a LOT of time to read code to look for vulnerabilities. OpenBSD when they did their fork from NetBSD, they choose to focus on security, and they had to invest a heckton of time.. working on reading code, and fixing bugs, refactoring stuff. And that took monthes, years and we're only talking about the operating system base code, not all the crap you are going to install over that system where you can bet that 99.99999 % of people will not go check the sources for trojans or bugs. No way.</p>

<p>This is why they worked hard to invent mecanisms to give the system better security : Niels Provos work on the PRNG, the Canary work on the stack, the development of the amazing OpenBSD packet filter software...</p>

<p>Seriously. Go talk with them and give those questions a proper answer and point of view. Because if someone knows what they're talking about on this field of knowledge, it's the OpenBSD people.</p>

<p>Nahh.  I gotta harp on the money/time thing here.  Money is Time.  â¬100 is, what, $132 U.S.?  A decent programmer can pull down a salary of, what, over $48/hr?  So you're talking about 2.5 hours of work.  Of course freelancers will charge more per hour to cover their overhead, so less than 2 hours of work.  Perhaps only 1 hour.</p>

<p>How many homework assignments, coding projects that is, did you get in College that could be completed in 2 hours?</p>

<p>Even full time employees with 6-figure salaries, they have a long list of things they have to do, with managers breathing down their neck.  Time is money.  Spend your time on something that's not required, and find yourself out of a job.</p>

<p>It all comes down to spend the money on security, or don't.  And that's decided at the top.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, so is blaming the guys on the bottom for what the guys at the top decided.</p>

<p>@ALL:</p>

<p>A question for you all,</p>

<p>'What are your in house coding rules?'</p>

<p>Firstly do you have any that are actually meaningful?</p>

<p>Also how do you deal with 'errors and exceptions'? Likewise is your 'input validation' at the input or distributed in with the actual business logic from which it is derived?</p>

<p>How about correct use for 'Design by Contract' or 'Defensive Development' when should you use one over the other?</p>

<p>How do your base in house rules compare with say,</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_10:_Rules_for_Developing_Safety-Critical_Code" rel="nofollow">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_10:_Rules_for_Developing_Safety-Critical_Code</a></p>

<p>Or the MISRA ruleset and DO-178B compliance requirments?</p>

<p>Do you think you could actually write code that does not use pointer math, recursion and fixed at load time process memory size, and importantly a call depth of no more than four? Just as 8bit micro developers had to do all the time.</p>

<p>Have a read of,</p>

</p>
<p>Isn't the summary of this that programmers who aren't properly incentivized to deliver secure software are bad at security software?</p>

<p>It seems to me that if you ran the same experiment but with the secure implementation specifics being the focal point / key deliverable or otherwise a contingency for getting paid you would get better results.</p>

<p>Bruce says:  "Programmers Who Don't Understand Security Are Poor at Security"</p>

<p>In order to reach that interpretation of the study, you first need to know that "most freelance programmers don't understand security".  I'm not sure that's currently known as widely as one might hope.</p>

<p>I also agree with the point that the low wages may be skewing things.  83% of freelance programmers that they approached refused the job entirely; I wouldn't be surprised if a significant number of those refused because the payment offered was too low for a competent execution of the task.</p>

<p>200 euros? really? What did they hired? <br />
Freelancer.com? does that site still exists? I only looked at it one time like in 2005 and that was all. Extremely unfriendly to developers, no wonder they got crap programmers there. At least if they wanted freelancers should've gone with upwork.com</p>

<p>This test proves only one thing. And that's the pay should match the requirement. Or the corollary - if you pay crap you get crap back.<br />
Next time they should hire actual programmers, not wannabe's. </p>

<p>So, no room any more now for the honour of the regiment, staying late and doing it on your own time because itâs right, smoothly producing it when done with a spiel that makes it part of the bossâs intention spoken and unspoken ? The kind if thing that carves your character and contributes to that invisible aura of a hope of a way forward that is somehow sensed by those that need or deserve to know ?

<p>Obvious stuff, but it is *good* that even things that seems obvious gets tested in research. You never know when you are up to a surprise.</p>

<p>Some may have the opposite problem. A basic know-how about security, but a boss or constituent that doesn't. I once got ridiculed at an workplace for storing passcodes by salted hashes. "We are not trying to build Fort Knox" where among the condescending comments I got. My boss thought I wasted time and resources by implementing the bare minimum of password security and I had a hard time fighting off 1234 as an default passcode. This was a couple of years ago, and of course, it was an "internet of things" thingy, but I don't know if the term was coined then. </p>

<p>I managed in the end to use hash and salts and refused to set 1234 as an default passcode. I guess I should have used an "in house" XOR-crypto instead! ;) </p>

<p>Why not indeed, after all it was good enough for Adobe last century ;-)</p>

<p>You will find,</p>

<p>"'The default algorithm, which is the same one used in ColdFusion 5 and ColdFusion MX, uses an XOR-based algorithm that uses a pseudo-random 32-bit key, based on a seed passed by the user as a function parameter. This algorithm is less secure than the other available algorithms.'"</p>

<p>Please note 'The default algorithm', so that makes it still 'The manufacturers recommended setting'. Or you could say 'Adobe still loves XOR encryption' despite knowing better...</p>

<p>Because they have previously been ridiculed for using it, very publically with the help of both the FBI and the world computer press...</p>

<p>For those with long memories, back nearly two degades ago, you might remember when the US arrested a Russian, the company for whom he had worked revealing that Adobe used xor encryption for their e-book reader, with the 'pseudo-random' key beeing the repeated use of 'Adobe',</p>

<p>@Leon:</p>

<p>"a small app, first release, plaintext passwords in a database managed by one trusted person on a internal server can very well be good enough."</p>

<p>But then it grows in scope, as all such things tend to do, untill it breaks.</p>

<p>The mantra of the software industry is 'code reuse' in various forms, with the result insecure code hangs around at best like the smell of cheap perfume and stale cigars in an out of town motel, but more often like fermenting fish in a tin can*.</p>

<p>The software industry needs to learn that as far as security is concerned you need to 'throw out the garbage' before you find yourself on top of a festering midden of code rotting beneath your feet, that nobody want's to touch let alone dive into...</p>

<p>Anyway it's late thus my brain needs sleep before it can do the subject of insecure legacy code justice.</p>

<p>* According to a Japanese study, a newly opened can of surstrÃ¶mming has one of the most putrid food smells in the world, stronger than similarly fermented fish dishes such as the Korean hongeohoe or Japanese kusaya. Because of the smell and preasure in the can it is normally opened in a bucket of water some distance from any building. It is likewise mostly eaten out doors served with both strong condiments, and strong spirits are often consumed prior, during and after it's consumption for obvious reasons. Apparently archeologists have found the 'delicacy' was made and consumed over nine millennia ago even without the assistance of barrels or cans. Among it's finer top notes is an astringent vinigar smell with base notes including that of rancid butter/cream, and briny middle notes. Therefor having attacked the olfactory senses like a battering ram and caused tears to flow in the young and maidens to flee in horror, it must qualify as a delicacy to be celebrated and it is with it's own festival...</p>

<p>I think all here is pointing to the fact that you get what you pay for and that good programmers cost money. I would argue that this is not the whole story and that ,as is the case with any other product, following  proper processes is the key to ensuring quality. This is even more so when dealing with more unforgiving areas like security where the cost of potential failure can outstrip any development costs by orders of magnitude. This fact, I am afraid, is not something sales people and project managers are still willing to accept in their short-term mindsets.</p>

Of the secure password storage systems developers chose to implement for this study, only the last two, PBKDF2 and Bcrypt, are considered secure.

<p>The first, Base64, isn't even an encryption algorithm, but an encoding function, something that the participating developers didn't seem to know. Similarly for MD5, which is a hashing function.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>...did I not read this correctly? SHA-256 is considered insecure? I thought they might be referring to salting, but that comes up later.</p>

<p>And MD5 is a hashing function (don't mention SHA for some reason?), which makes it irrelevant how?..</p>

<p>@outadoc</p>

<p>It's not that SHA256 is insecure per se, but it's not what you want to use for password hashing.</p>

<p>See, SHA256, and any standard hashing function, from md5 to SHA3/Keccak, are designed to be fast.</p>

<p>This is not something you want for password hashing. You need slow hashing functions, which is made to be slow.</p>

<p>Bcrypt, PBKDF2, Argon2 are slow hashing functions, and are considered secure for password hashing.</p>

<p>Also, a slow hashing function will usually come with some parameters to be able to tune the time it takes to compute the hash (e.g. the cost factor in BCrypt).</p>

<p>Also, these functions will usually handle the salting for you, which make them inherently more secure by default.</p>

<p>So the take here is : <b>use the right tool for the job</b>.<br />
Password hashing? Slow hashing functions (Bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2).<br />
But file hashing? Then fast hashing functions with enough bits according to your need (SHA1, SHA2 or SHA3).<br />

<p>"The technology that repelled the hackers was a style of software programming known as formal verification.

<p>@Ismar:</p>

<p>"I think all here is pointing to the fact that you get what you pay for and that good programmers cost money"</p>

<p>You left out 'experienced' ;-)</p>

<p>But for others, experience is probably the real factor you are lookibg for. It's often said it takes 10,000hours to train some one in their twenties to become competent at a mechanical skill and four times that to become skilled. So you get payed for 2000hours a year, you can easily work out what you are going to have to pay in dues to become competent in five years.</p>

<p>That said their is an age factor, it can take less than a third of those times if you start around ten, and twice as long if you start at fourty.</p>

<p>That said though there is a lot more to writing software than bashing it out on the keyboard as lines of code a day (which some managers in the past have thougt). Certain mind sets have been found to produce ten times the average  rate of not just 'accepted' code but more importabtly those lines that don't need to be changed in maintenance. This is even though their lines of code a day numbers might well appear average.</p>

<p>There are two points that can be immediately drawn from this,</p>

<p>1, It is more a cerebral than manual skill.</p>

<p>2, It is also a skill that is not best suited to many minds.</p>

<p>Whilst as business owners you want the best the chances are you are going to get average at best.</p>

<p>It also suggests a stratagy for some software writers who feel they are below par to follow. Which mad as it might seem is 'Always work on code that you know will be cut as the specification changes'. That way you can churn out lots of 'so so' code knowing it's not going to get realy tested, if tested at all. Thus your commits are high but they get cut for reasons that are not your fault.</p>

<p>But also you need to keep an eye on 'work required' skills and by that I don't mean the 'job required' skills* like languages, toolchains or development methods (though you should keep an eye on those as standard). Back when I got going the only high level language you would find outside a University was Cobol or Basic, the rest was CPU specific assembler in very limited resources. RAM was around 0.1USD a byte and EPROM was more expensive still. You had to know some quite arcane things, like on certain versions of the Z80 CPU it was faster to fetch from RAM than the registers in some instructions. Other tricks like 'XOR A with A' on CPUs that did not have a 'CLRA' instruction was less space in ROM but slower than a load with zero, so there were trade offs that no compiler could do then or even now without help. But the average programmer is not going to write assembler these days, the closest they will get will be C or later derivations. But more importantly for most resource issues will not be something they ever need think about let alone have to out think the compiler to meet the resource issue that is upper most in the problem list, or even have to effectively invent an interpreting programing language that can give you better instruction to byte density than main stream languages.</p>

<p>In fact it's now undesirable to write more than one instruction per line or even play 'language tricks' because you generally not only have the resources, it also has a significant effect on the down stream costs such as upgrading, maintaining and supporting.</p>

<p>Thus these days a good 'practical' 'work required' knowledge that is independent of programing methods/styles, languages, or hardware is where you should be aiming. That is algorithms and abstract data type usage is more likely to be a usefull investment of time as it won't age. Something that requires rather less keyboard time than book time. Likewise other 'foundation' aspects that will give you a beter understanding of things such as formal methods.</p>

<p>But the most important skill you need to develop would once have been called 'thinking hinky' it's defensive programing on a different plane. Like designing Crypto algorithms, you first have to understand how your code can be attacked and how to mitigate it. Whilst at first it might appear to be a language feature issue, it's actually way more general as their are significant attacks against algorithms, protocols and standards. But importantly remember an algorithm, protocol or standard that is theoreticaly secure is very often not implementaion secure, time based side channels being just one attack class they can and do fail against. This is 'work required' knowledge again and independent of the 'job required' highly volatile language, toolchain and develipment methodologies.</p>

<p>* For those that are not sure of the difference between 'work required' and 'job required' think of it broadly as 'Does it appear in job application listings' if it does then it's a 'job requirment' not a 'work requirment'.</p>

<p>@ Bob,</p>

<blockquote><i>Implementing open source code into a project is in no way, shape, or form "plagiarism."</i></blockquote>

<p>Actually that rather depends on the licence.</p>

<p>I've seen code that has a very specific licence requirment be put into commercial code very much against the licence requirment.</p>

<p>I suspect anyone who just,</p>

<blockquote><i>grabbed the first thing they found on GitHub that did the job.</i></blockquote>

<p>Is highly unlikely to declare that's what they did to their boss for a number of reasons. So the licence terms won't get followed either. </p>

<p>I've seen conversations in commercial shops where some bright young spark has suggested OS usage. It got stamped on hard very fast, because it would then be in effect a conspiracy with those in the room becoming complicit and so on up the managment chain. Even when it's the 'use of a tool' many commercial shops get very cautious even after some corporate lawyer has OK'd it etc. Because of the old 'No 24x7 maintainence' or 'No help line' or the best one 'No body to pay'...</p>

<p>So yes a quick 'cut-n-paste' might save somebody time, but it's legaly very questionable even under 'fair use' rules, as acknowledgment is unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>People tend to forget all code written no matter how good or bad, compleate or incompleate has a copyright on it, yes even that 'hello world' progran. Likewise the way dictionary words are re-purposed in a programing language, is a 'work' thus you get interesting copyright statments in standards etc, likewise implementation in compiler etc documentation and licences, all the way down.</p>

<p>Some people are very strict about such things especially in the various OS movements where 'free' means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.</p>

<p>There is nothing inherently insecure about xor in encryption.  But the key has to be a stream of truly pseudo random bits.  Xor is used extensively in encryption.</p>

<p>But xor is not as easily applicable as the principal part of the hashing process.</p>

<p>@Faustus:</p>

<p>"There is nothing inherently insecure about xor in encryption."</p>

<p>No nor any other simple bidirectional function such as ADD/SUB and MUL/DIV in integer fields.</p>

<p>"But the key has to be a stream of truly pseudo random bits."</p>

<p>Is the resulting problem, as with nearly all stream ciphers. The simple bidirectional function alows for a range of attacks that don't realy work on block ciphers.</p>

<p>Block ciphers generally use one way functions as part of a mixing process with the plaintext. This is done over a number of rounds and makes the reversing of individual rounds to find the key information very much more difficult. In part it's why you can increment either the data in or key in when implementing a CTR mode to make a stream generator.</p>

<p>The reason block ciphers became prefered outside of Europe is in general when used in fairly easy to develop modes they don't have the major key reuse weaknesses of stream ciphers. Especially when you consider just how difficult it actually is to prevent 'Key Reuse' without making key selection predictable.</p>

<p>Whilst there is little wrong with a properly implemented stream cipher and use mode, coming up with a 'properly implemented' stream cipher is actually quite hard.</p>

<p>The fact Adobe do not appear to have done it with the XOR function in over a couple of decades gives you an indication of why stream ciphers are not for general use. Especially for tasks like secure password verification storage or systems such as hard drives where similar but not quite identical plaintex is to be expected such as in bulk storage devices such as hard drives.</p>

<p>@Faustus If a programmer explicitly using a XOR operation is part of a security sensitive process (rather than making calls to a well-reviewed crypto library) there is a problem.</p>

<p>Bruce- this survey is not ideal. But the freelance Indians hired in this survey are likely no less competent than those they would have gotten had they hired similar Indians on a H1b on a salary.

<p>@Faustus:<br />
We all know that. But that is not the point. Whenever someone knowable about security says "XOR encryption" they generally means the insecure VigenÃ¨re cipher in a modern form. Of course, used in a one time pad scheme it's as secure as anything else, and many encryption algorithms considered secure (even if they are cryptologically broken) use XOR in some fashion (but not XOR'ing directly with a repeat of the password as in a VigenÃ¨re cipher).</p>

<p>Besides, secure password storage should not and can not be based on encryption. It must rely on a one-way function. Otherwise you just have an encryption key to store somewhere in plain. Or encrypt it and put that key in plain. And encrypt that one and...</p>

<p>I think, the funniest thing in the whole research is the following article itself.<br />
"Catalin Cimpanu is a <b>security reporter</b> at ZDNet" stating this:<br />
<cite><br />
The first, Base64, isn't even an <b>encryption</b> algorithm [...]</cite><br />
<cite><br />
Similarly for MD5, which is a <b>hashing</b> function [...]</cite><br />
<cite><br />
[...] a process through which the <b>encrypted</b> password [...]</cite></p>

<p>He <b>is</b> implying that you should encrypt your password. Apparently, with PBKDF2 and Bcrypt, which are both, TAN TAN TAAAAAN, hashing functions. Isn't the whole situation is hilarious?</p>

<p><cite>"Many participants used hashing and encryption as synonyms," the team of academics said in their research paper.</cite><br />
One should add that many security reporters either.</p>

<p>@Robert:</p>

<p>"the easy answer is this isn't part of the job description."</p>

<p>Do you understand the difference between 'job requirments' and 'work requirments?</p>

<p>A 'job requirment' is specific to an instance of employment, thus things like you find in 'job listings' and 'project specifications/plans'.</p>

<p>However 'work requirments' are in effect what you expect a sutable employee to know as part of their training. Thus they know not to put in screws with a hammer, or try to drill a hole with the drive set in reverse. That is the things you should have learned as part of your progress as a 'journyman' through your training to 'qualified practitioner'.</p>

<p>The issues with password storage have been known about as an ongoing problem since atleast the 1960's or 50's, which means that there should be no 'qualified practitioners' out there who would not be aware of the issues.</p>

<p>Thus what you are actually claiming is these persons training or mentality has made the either not qualified or unfit to claim to be qualified to carry out the job.</p>

<p>Which as you have chosen to excuse them being unprofessional you should realise reflects back on your level of professionalism not exactly favourably.</p>

<p>I know the software industry embraces 'free market ideology' more than most, part of which is seeking to avoide all liability for what is in most cases work 'unfit to market'. But those behaviours are now so bad that as software gains 'physical agency' people will die, in much greater numbers than they already have (Boeing 737 MAX being just the latest 370 odd fatalities). Which will lead eventually to regulation having to be put in place and practitioners having to be licenced in competence by proffessional bodies as it currently is with the practice of law, medicine and other forms of construction/engineering.</p>

<p>Importantly though as time goes on to rise in any of the construction/engineering fields of endevor you will have to be not just multidisciplinary but multilicenced. This not only means considerably more time in formal education but also high level professional life long 'tested learning', something that came as a bit of a shock to many in the medical profession a decade or so ago. As this will have a significant effect on peoples remuneration it will come as a bit of a shock to the 'rent seekers' who will have to pay significantly higher rates for what they would regared as lower productivity, hence their strong opposition to cleaning up their very unsafe, insecure thus very dangerous behaviours.</p>

<p>@Bill Paxton:</p>

<p>"If a programmer explicitly using a XOR operation is part of a security sensitive process (rather than making calls to a well-reviewed crypto library) there is a problem."</p>

<p>Yes there is.</p>

<p>However using a library is not enough and in some respects might actually be detrimental in the long term.</p>

<p>As any one who has knocked around the industry for a while knows, libraries are just snippets of code, and all code has issues. Thus inescapably libraries have not just coding issues, they bring along a few more of their own as well.</p>

<p>Firstly and quite importantly libraries become a single point of failure for many products. Which makes an attackers life way way more easy (as do fsilings in protocols or standards).</p>

<p>Secondly libraries are never perfect, the Standard C library for instance has had it's security issues. Likewise a number of crypto libraries just 'code cut' the AES code from the competition entries. Mostly those entries were coding for something other than security, like fast execution. Which is what the NSA were hoping for, thus most early crypto libraries and all the products built on them, many of which are still in use have significant and not too difficult to exploit security vulnerabilities such as timing channels that leak key bits to the network even through routers.</p>

<p>Thirdly few ever look inside libraries commercial librares are generally 'black boxes' and even open source libraries are frequently treated the same way. This often leads to issues from either insuficient documentation or understanding of it by programmers who use the library. A couple of examples that come to mind is the use of seeds/IVs and crypto nonces. Using crypto libraries often requires knowledge that few programmers possess, and won't get by not looking in the box (even though it might look like the handywork of Pandora).</p>

<p>Fourthly libraries are built by programmers implementing algorithms. The use of libraries does not encorage programmers to learn about cryptography or other safety or security subjects, they frequently as a matter of expediency take other peoples examples and drop them in to their own code 'sight unseen'. As a result testing will be at best deficient or none at all in the areas of importance (safety/security).</p>

<p>Fifthly by definition libraries are a reflection of the past. That is they are built with out of date knowledge and they age often rapidly where security and safety are concerned. This causes all sorts of issues in other areas of security and safety which can easily become mind blowingly expensive as far as recertification is concerned. Which actively discourages proactive updating of safety or security critical software.</p>

<p>I could go one but I hope the point is made that we need a better way than either option, and before you ask, no I've only vague notions of how to do better, all of which come with a big old price tag.</p>

<p>But in the real physical world we have come to accept that somethings have to be done in the 'capitalist with a small C way' whilst others have to be done in the 'socialist with a small S way' and these need to be payed for by all unlike the capatilist way where it falls on actual consumers. </p>

<p>That is things that form the foundations of society everybody needs and uses, have to be done 'for the good of all' 'by all' such as infrustructure like roads etc paid for by taxation. Other things such as end products have to have aspects of market competition to drive technology and efficiency, thus society forwards, but should be paid for by those who chose to benifit by them. And yes there is a very big fat grey zone in the middle, usually made fatter than it should be by self interested parties.</p>

<p>I'm of the mind that cryprography is a 'public good' like law thus it should like any foundation to society be treated as infrastructure and should not just payed for by all but developed for all. In what manner this social good might be achieved is realy a subject for a thread of it's own, but I certainly think it should be over and above any industry based regulation or taxation.</p>

<p>@TatÃ¼tata:</p>

<p>"Most of those 100â¬ rent-a-coders apparently did a better job in a couple of hours than Facebook in 15 years..."</p>

<p>Ahh but they unlike FaceCrook had little or nothing further to gain from their work secure or insecure as it might be.</p>

<p>We know from what the Manky Psychoburg has done with the 2FA security aspect from which money could be made --ie the telephone numbers-- he has ruthlessly without consent or informing them monetized behind peoples backs. In the process making fools of many who recommended that that type of 2FA was a security improvment, rather than just another ruthless exploitation tactic.</p>

<p>Thus based on that past behaviour alone, it would be fair to assume that the Manky Psychoburg was fully aware of the storing of plaintext passwords and probably put it in place in the first place. With the specific intent of some how making money from the data at some point in the future (if he has not already done so). Again without informing or asking for consent. Don't be fooled by the 'internal review' that just means that somebody realised it was going to go bad very bad in the near future and wanted to brush it all under the carpet as a risk not worth it's potential reward in this current political climate.</p>

<p>And people wonder why I don't in my private life do Social Media, Instant messaging or even Email these days. I guess others, but by no means all people, will catch up as the penny bounces off of their toe or head whilst dropping from a very great hight... </p>

<p>@Leon:  "Take the other viewpoint: from a small app, first release, plaintext passwords in a database managed by one trusted person on a internal server can very well be good enough."</p>

<p>If by "good enough" you mean "responsible practice", then <strong>NO</strong>, it is absolutely not.</p>

<p>People reuse passwords all the time.  Reusing a high-security password in a low-security application is a bad idea, and you might not want your users to do it, but it is head-in-the-sand irresponsible to <strong>rely</strong> on your customers to not do it.</p>

<p>Therefore, ANY public-facing system should store salted hashes instead of plaintext passwords, no matter how trivial the application.  Only systems that are not accessible to the general public could reasonably consider doing less.</p>

<p>Of course, if by "good enough" you mean "the lazy developer will probably not be penalized for knowingly screwing their customers", then you are likely correct.</p>

<p>"Of the 43, academics paid half of the group with â¬100, and the other half with â¬200, to determine if higher pay made a difference in the implementation of password security features."</p>

<p>I hope these academics didn't congratulate themselves that they removed the element of pay from their experiment. The only people you're going to attract with such a low fee are programmers with so little experience and/or skill that it invalidates whatever conclusion you draw from it. </p>

<p>I hope the researchers didn't get paid for than â¬200 for this ridiculous waste of time.<br />

<p>I believe you've under estimated the scope of the problem. It will require more than better-educated "professionals" on top of strigent government-issued code of conducts. Using your construction engineering example, local governments have extensive codes of conduct in place to ensure a building is properly constructed. It takes more than hired labours who knew how to screw a screw the right way. The inspection process is multi-layered. Every work/job (your choice of vocab) must no only be properly done by licensed pro's but also checked by qualified inspectors.</p>

<p>This is somewhat inadequately done in the "software engineering" process. </p>

<p>In response, the US Post Office is introducing a more secure mailbox:</p>

<p>This is a Ninja technique. </p>

<p>Which leads to the interesting questions: there were Ninja a few hundred years ago in Japan. Where are they now? </p>

<p>Our neighborhood has community PO Boxes at the end of each street.  Individual house boxes are locked, and there are a couple of drop slots to mail letters.  Those slots are approximately 12" wide and 1/2" high, with an angled opening.  Each bank of boxes has a couple of lockers, which the mail carrier can lock small packages in, leaving the key in your mailbox.</p>

<p>I haven't heard of this kind of mail theft.  It seems like a complete shot in the dark that someone would get something worthwhile.  Most people rarely send checks anymore.</p>

<p>Our neighborhood has a much bigger problem with package theft off people's front porches.  This applies to USPS, UPS, FedEX, Amazon, etc.</p>

<p>@Rick Lobrecht</p>

<p>Mail thieves regularly hit community mailbox clusters to steal outgoing mail.  Especially during the holidays, but anytime throughout the year grandma can be mailing out a gift card or cash.  One favorite are paper checks, which can be "washed" and the re-written.</p>

<p>I never used my community mailbox cluster for any outgoing mail of importance.  A few years ago I sent out a mail merge for 20 or so new "hams" (amateur radio operators) inviting them to the next upcoming local club meeting.</p>

<p>A few weeks later I got a letter from the local police department saying they had property of mine down at their evidence facility.  I was puzzled what it was.  Turns out it was this mail, which someone had stolen.  No value, except I was out the 20 or so stamps plus the folks didn't get a timely congratulations and invite.</p>

<p>The other problem we've had is thieves somehow making or duplicating the main cluster key.  Then they just take all of the mail, including outgoing.  This is usually done late at night or in the wee hours so no one will see them.  So, never leave mail in the cluster overnight, and if you're going to be gone have a mail hold put in place.</p>

<p>They can add a laser movement checker that checks movement of object inside of entrance of mailbox. If the object moves backwards ( I mean down to up) instead of forwards (up to down), it should have a auto lock system or warning by SMS, sound and etc. </p>

</p>
<p>In the 1963 film "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057616/" rel="nofollow">Un drÃ´le de paroissien</a>" (EN: "Heaven Sent") by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006620/" rel="nofollow">Jean-Pierre Mocky</a>, the character played by actor Bourvil is a member of the aristocracy for whom working is beneath his dignity. But after the French revolution living off your serfs became a little bit complicated, and his family was in dire straights, with almost every piece of furniture pawned, and no electricity.</p>

<p>So he goes to church to get advice from God, who sends him a sign: thou shalt help yourself to the offering boxes. They are there for the poor, and you are poor, so this isn't theft. (There is a strong taste of Jesuit casuistic...)</p>

<p>With that revelation, George runs home, to dedicate himself to his new vocation.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/j3SUHg5q4oQ?t=703" rel="nofollow">In the sequence from @ 11'43"</a>, he rips his own mailbox for the wall to use as training material, and in the next minutes he perfects his skills. He begins with caramels on strings, and by end of the film he prepares the boxes for faster service by sawing off their top and installing additional hinges, while ridiculing the police (which doesn't really need any help in that area).</p>

<p>I checked whether the USPS had any interesting innovations in  mailboxes. Nothing worth mentioning, but I incidentally came across this <a href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&NR=2019051079A1&KC=A1&FT=D&ND=3&date=20190214&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_ep" rel="nofollow">2017 filing published a few weeks ago</a>, called "CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY TRACKED AND SECURED VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEM". Blockchain is of course mentioned. Besides the technical aspects, which I don't really have time to delve into, I'm curious as to what their business model would be. A federal service provider to states and local governments?<br />

<p>The mail thieves where I live got so sophisticated that I just had my mail forwarded to the last place they'd ever look. *Their* mailboxes, which I regularly pilfer at night to safely retrieve my own mail.</p>

<p>Interesting... but in my town, USPS has removed all but one mailbox.  At least, it was still in the bank parking lot a year or so ago.  I haven't been by there in a while.</p>

<p>I've read this whole page and only at the end suddenly realised you are not talking about mail boxes at your house.  Which I assumed all had 'shark teeth' style slots. picking the lock sounds like exponentially less effort.  You are talking about a post box - the kind the postperson attends on the bicylce or motorbike to retrieve the large quantity of motherlode in a big sack, once or twice a day. Added to the confusion is I understand the US has a system whereby one can send outgoing mail from ones own personal letter box, by raising the red flag. Or is that just in the pictures?</p>

<p>maybe this was the real intention of the IRA and pillar boxes in London. <br />
Quick access to grannies christmas cards, perhaps a winning sweepstakes ticket sent off by the claimant.<br />
  Why didn't anyone ever consider this? Not enough creative thinking in Westminister, I'll say. </p>

<p>"one can send outgoing mail from ones own personal letter box, by raising the red flag."</p>

<p>Also known, in some rougher neighborhoods, as the "Steal Me" flag.  Getting something out of your own mailbox is a lot easier than out of a USPS roadside box.</p>

<p>Just so long as some "clever" person in the USPS doesn't propose fitting a device to prevent this which is also connected to the internet to report tampering.  Another unnecessary IOT device to become vulnerable ....</p>

<p>My neighborhood of northeastern Queens, NY has been struggling with an epidemic of this for more than a year. It's been a constant refrain of the local precincts' crime prevention teams to post valuable mail from inside the P.O. only, and the rollout of upgraded mailboxes is in full effect. <a href="https://qns.com/story/2018/07/09/residents-urged-not-use-usps-mailboxes-mail-thefts-reported-bayside-little-neck/" rel="nofollow">QNS.com</a></p>

<p>Amusingly, it was apparently so lucrative an undertaking around here that some thieves decided the whole "fishing" schtick was a waste of valuable time. They pulled together a few strong guys and a van so they could just rip the whole box off the sidewalk and drive away with it. Points for chutzpah, but <a href="https://patch.com/new-york/foresthills/perps-caught-stealing-usps-mailbox-forest-hills-police-say" rel="nofollow">it didn't work</a>.</p>

<p>re: The crime has become more common in the past few years.<br />
How common? The linked article has zero metrics. Isn't security supposed to balance risk against cost? Further - Does USPS *really* intend to mitigate this by wholesale replacement of mail boxes? How many millions will that cost? Per Baba K: If the magnitude really does require the issue to be addressed (again, no metrics,) surely existing mailboxes could be modified. If the suggestion of a "motion direction detector" is infeasible (I do like it, but wonder what should happen next, after "anti-peristalsis" is detected :) it would seem ridiculously cheap and easy to retrofit a smaller slot that would allow letters only. </p>

<p>@VinnyG<br />
Very few people use letters as a means of communication anymore, which means the proportion of mail containing bills is much higher now. So assuming a similar risk per letter stolen now vs then, we can assume that the risk/reward is much better now.</p>

</p>
<p>Surely there's an operational solution to this.<br />
If the postperson collect mail at say 18hrs, only mail deposited after that time is going to be stolen - given that thieves strike in the tiny hours.  The thieves can only steal after hours deposits. <br />
A sliding deadbolt by the postperson could secure the hatch on mail collection preventing deposits, and open it again at 07hrs. Only one mail collection a day for at risk boxes. <br />
Rip out all the boxes and have secure walk-in rooms a la ATM'S for after hours posting. That would be cheaper than hi-tech implementation </p>

<p>Change your mail delivery as follows. Have the mail delivered by persons unknown at times unknown in a thickly stuffed unmarked manila envelope directly to an apparently beat-up, disused, rusty mail box, at the edge of an unkempt, weed strewn yard, surrounding a decrepit apparently abandoned house, with a good number of large trees. There should be a yellow chalk mark somewhere on the fence. If the loose metal fence gate is hanging by one hinge and makes gentle creaking sounds, so much the better. Pick up your mail at 2 am. Be driving an early fifties American make car, black in color (the delivery should also be made using a black car) . Make sure you're not followed. Leave expeditiously.</p>

<p>And the mailbox can be recognised by its muted posthorn and a marking that reads "W.A.S.T.E.". </p>

<p>@ Peter re: "Very few people use letters as a means of communication anymore..." Plausible. I would need to see a statistical analysis of types of mail deposited in street corner USPS boxes before completely agreeing with your proposition, however. On the other hand, I suspect that such an analysis might indicate that those boxes no longer serve any compelling purpose of any kind, which would ensure  that you will never see it...</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011912"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/01/prices_for_zero.html">Prices for Zero-Day Exploits Are Rising</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Companies are willing to pay <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/zeroday-exploit-prices-continue-to-soar-especially-for-ios-and-messaging-apps/">ever-increasing amounts</a> for good zero-day exploits against hard-to-break computers and applications:</p>

<blockquote><p>On Monday, market-leading exploit broker Zerodium said it would pay up to $2 million for zero-click jailbreaks of Apple's iOS, $1.5 million for one-click iOS jailbreaks, and $1 million for exploits that take over secure messaging apps WhatsApp and iMessage. Previously, Zerodium was offering $1.5 million, $1 million, and $500,000 for the same types of exploits respectively. The steeper prices indicate not only that the demand for these exploits continues to grow, but also that reliably compromising these targets is becoming increasingly hard.</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that these prices are for offensive uses of the exploit. Zerodium -- and others -- sell exploits to companies who make surveillance tools and cyber-weapons for governments. Many companies have bug bounty programs for those who want the exploit used for defensive purposes -- i.e., fixed -- but they pay orders of magnitude less. This is a problem.</p>

<p>Back in 2014, Dan Geer <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/dan-geer-touts-liability-policies-for-software-vulnerabilities/d/d-id/1297838">said</a> that that the US should corner the market on software vulnerabilities:</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is no doubt that the U.S. Government could openly corner the world vulnerability market," said Geer, "that is, we buy them all and we make them all public. Simply announce 'Show us a competing bid, and we'll give you [10 times more].' Sure, there are some who will say 'I hate Americans; I sell only to Ukrainians,' but because vulnerability finding is increasingly automation-assisted, the seller who won't sell to the Americans knows that his vulns can be rediscovered in due course by someone who <i>will</i> sell to the Americans who will tell everybody, thus his need to sell his product before it outdates is irresistible."</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't know about the 10x, but in theory he's right. There's no other way to solve this.</p>

	    <p>Good <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/opinion/cellphones-security-spying.html">essay</a> on the inherent vulnerabilities in the cell phone standards and the market barriers to fixing them.</p>

<blockquote><p>So far, industry and policymakers have largely dragged their feet when it comes to blocking cell-site simulators and SS7 attacks. Senator Ron Wyden, one of the few lawmakers vocal about this issue, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/24/fbi-surveillance-devices-may-interfere-with-calls-us-senator-says/">sent a letter in August</a> encouraging the Department of Justice to "be forthright with federal courts about the disruptive nature of cell-site simulators." No response has ever been published.

<p>The lack of action could be because it is a big task -- there are hundreds of companies and international bodies involved in the cellular network. The other reason could be that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have a vested interest in exploiting these same vulnerabilities. But law enforcement has other effective tools that are unavailable to criminals and spies. For example, the police can work directly with phone companies, serving warrants and Title III wiretap orders. In the end, eliminating these vulnerabilities is just as valuable for law enforcement as it is for everyone else.</p>

<p>As it stands, there is no government agency that has the power, funding and mission to fix the problems. Large companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Google and Apple have not been public about their efforts, if any exist.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>No one doubts that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will transform cybersecurity. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611860/ai-for-cybersecurity-is-a-hot-new-thing-and-a-dangerous-gamble/">We</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/03/artificial_inte.html">just</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-machine-learning-cybersecurity/">don't</a> <a href="https://threatpost.com/artificial-intelligence-a-cybersecurity-tool-for-good-and-sometimes-bad/137831/">know</a> <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3295596/security/ai-in-cybersecurity-what-works-and-what-doesnt.html">how</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/10/15/how-big-of-a-role-will-ai-have-in-cyber-security-over-the-next-decade/#3161f8676d1c">or</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ai-can-help-stop-cyberattacks-1537322940">when</a>. While the literature generally focuses on the different uses of AI by attackers and defenders Â­ and the resultant arms race between the two Â­ I want to talk about software vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>All software contains bugs. The reason is basically economic: The market doesn't want to pay for quality software. With a few exceptions, such as the space shuttle, the market prioritizes fast and cheap over good. The result is that any large modern software package contains hundreds or thousands of bugs.</p>

<p>Some percentage of bugs are also vulnerabilities, and a percentage of those are <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/threat-actors-prey-on-drupalgeddon-vulnerability-to-mass-compromise-websites-and-underlying-servers/">exploitable vulnerabilities</a>, meaning an attacker who knows about them can attack the underlying system in some way. And some percentage of those are discovered and used. This is why your computer and smartphone software is constantly being patched; software vendors are fixing bugs that are also vulnerabilities that have been discovered and are being used.</p>

<p>Everything would be better if software vendors found and fixed all bugs during the design and development process, but, as I said, the market doesn't reward that kind of delay and expense. AI, and machine learning in particular, has the potential to forever change this trade-off.</p>

<p>The problem of finding software vulnerabilities seems well-suited for ML systems. Going through code line by line is just the sort of tedious problem that computers excel at, if we can only teach them what a vulnerability looks like. There are challenges with that, of course, but there is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04320.pdf">already</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04497">a</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3180453">healthy</a> <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5033718">amount</a> <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/02/ndss2018_03A-2_Li_paper.pdf">of</a> <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/5/1652/pdf">academic</a> <a href="https://dspace.ou.nl/bitstream/1820/9725/1/Kronjee%20J%20IM9906%20AF%20scriptie.pdf">literature</a> on the topic -- <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-machine-learning-can-be-used-to-write-more-secure-computer-programs">and</a> <a href="http://www.vdiscover.org/">research</a> <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2018-07-machine-software-vulnerabilities.html">is</a> <a href="https://sdtimes.com/deep-neural-networks/microsoft-uses-machine-learning-combat-security-vulnerabilities/">continuing</a>. There's every reason to expect ML systems to get better at this as time goes on, and some reason to expect them to eventually become very good at it.</p>

<p>Finding vulnerabilities can benefit both attackers and defenders, but it's not a fair fight. When an attacker's ML system finds a vulnerability in software, the attacker can use it to compromise systems. When a defender's ML system finds the same vulnerability, he or she can try to patch the system or program network defenses to watch for and block code that tries to exploit it.</p>

<p>But when the same system is in the hands of a software developer who uses it to find the vulnerability before the software is ever released, the developer fixes it so it can never be used in the first place. The ML system will probably be part of his or her software design tools and will automatically find and fix vulnerabilities while the code is still in development.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a decade or so into the future. We might say to each other, "Remember those years when software vulnerabilities were a thing, before ML vulnerability finders were built into every compiler and fixed them before the software was ever released? Wow, those were crazy years." Not only is this future possible, but I would bet on it.</p>

<p>Getting from here to there will be a dangerous ride, though. Those vulnerability finders will first be unleashed on existing software, giving attackers hundreds if not thousands of vulnerabilities to exploit in real-world attacks. Sure, defenders can use the same systems, but many of today's <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/as-iot-security-concerns-rise-are-solutions-keeping-up/">Internet of Things systems</a> have no engineering teams to write patches and no ability to download and install patches. The result will be hundreds of vulnerabilities that attackers can find and use.</p>

<p>But if we look far enough into the horizon, we can see a future where <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/application-security/appscan">software vulnerabilities</a> are a thing of the past. Then we'll just have to worry about whatever <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/mayhem-darpa-cyber-grand-challenge-dod-voltron/">new and more advanced</a> attack techniques those AI systems come up with.</p>

	    <p>Interesting research: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06542.pdf">Dancing Pigs or Externalities? Measuring the Rationality of<br />
Security Decisions</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Accurately modeling human decision-making in security is critical to thinking about when, why, and how to recommend that users adopt certain secure behaviors. In this work, we conduct behavioral economics experiments to model the rationality of end-user security decision-making in a realistic online experimental system simulating a bank account. We ask participants to make a financially impactful security choice, in the face of transparent risks of account compromise and benefits offered by an optional security behavior (two-factor authentication). We measure the cost and utility of adopting the security behavior via measurements of time spent executing the behavior and estimates of the participant's wage. We find that more than 50% of our participants made rational (e.g., utility optimal) decisions, and we find that participants are more likely to behave rationally in the face of higher risk. Additionally, we find that users' decisions can be modeled well as a function of past behavior (anchoring effects), knowledge of costs, and to a lesser extent, users' awareness of risks and context (R<sup>2</sup>=0.61). We also find evidence of endowment effects, as seen in other areas of economic and psychological decision-science literature, in our digital-security setting. Finally, using our data, we show theoretically that a "one-size-fits-all" emphasis on security can lead to market losses, but that adoption by a subset of users with higher risks or lower costs can lead to market gains</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The UK's GCHQ delivers a brutally blunt <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/quantum-key-distribution">assessment</a> of quantum key distribution:</p>

<blockquote><p>QKD protocols address only the problem of agreeing keys for encrypting data. Ubiquitous on-demand modern services (such as verifying identities and data integrity, establishing network sessions, providing access control, and automatic software updates) rely more on authentication and integrity mechanisms -- such as digital signatures -- than on encryption.

<p>QKD technology cannot replace the flexible authentication mechanisms provided by contemporary public key signatures. QKD also seems unsuitable for some of the grand future challenges such as securing the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, social media, or cloud applications.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with them. It's a clever idea, but basically useless in practice. I don't even think it's anything more than a niche solution in a world where quantum computers have broken our traditional public-key algorithms.</p>

<p>Read the whole thing. It's short.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011649"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/on_financial_fr.html">On Financial Fraud</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>There are some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/28/how-to-get-away-with-financial-fraud">good lessons</a> in this article on financial fraud:</p>

<blockquote><p>That's how we got it so wrong. We were looking for incidental breaches of technical regulations, not systematic crime. And the thing is, that's normal. The nature of fraud is that it works outside your field of vision, subverting the normal checks and balances so that the world changes while the picture stays the same. People in financial markets have been missing the wood for the trees for as long as there have been markets.

<p>[..]</p>

<p>Trust -- particularly between complete strangers, with no interactions beside relatively anonymous market transactions -- is the basis of the modern industrial economy. And the story of the development of the modern economy is in large part the story of the invention and improvement of technologies and institutions for managing that trust.</p>

<p>And as industrial society develops, it becomes easier to be a victim. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described how prosperity derived from the division of labour -- the 18 distinct operations that went into the manufacture of a pin, for example. While this was going on, the modern world also saw a growing division of trust. The more a society benefits from the division of labour in checking up on things, the further you can go into a con game before you realise that you're in one.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Libor teaches us a valuable lesson about commercial fraud -- that unlike other crimes, it has a problem of denial as well as one of detection. There are very few other criminal acts where the victim not only consents to the criminal act, but voluntarily transfers the money or valuable goods to the criminal. And the hierarchies, status distinctions and networks that make up a modern economy also create powerful psychological barriers against seeing fraud when it is happening. White-collar crime is partly defined by the kind of person who commits it: a person of high status in the community, the kind of person who is always given the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Fraudsters don't play on moral weaknesses, greed or fear; they play on weaknesses in the system of checks and balances -- the audit processes that are meant to supplement an overall environment of trust. One point that comes up again and again when looking at famous and large-scale frauds is that, in many cases, everything could have been brought to a halt at a very early stage if anyone had taken care to confirm all the facts. But nobody does confirm all the facts. There are just too bloody many of them. Even after the financial rubble has settled and the arrests been made, this is a huge problem.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011634"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/department_of_c.html">Department of Commerce Report on the Botnet Threat</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Last month, the US Department of Commerce released a <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/media/files/2018/eo_13800_botnet_report_-_finalv2.pdf">report</a> on the threat of botnets and what to do about it. I note that it explicitly said that the IoT makes the threat worse, and that the solutions are largely economic.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Departments determined that the opportunities and challenges in working toward dramatically reducing threats from automated, distributed attacks can be summarized in six principal themes.

<ol><li><b>Automated, distributed attacks are a global problem.</b> The majority of the compromised devices in recent noteworthy botnets have been geographically located outside the United States. To increase the resilience of the Internet and communications ecosystem against these threats, many of which originate outside the United States, we must continue to work closely with international partners.

<p><li><b>Effective tools exist, but are not widely used.</b> While there remains room for improvement, the tools, processes, and practices required to significantly enhance the resilience of the Internet and communications ecosystem are widely available, and are routinely applied in selected market sectors. However, they are not part of common practices for product development and deployment in many other sectors for a variety of reasons, including (but not limited to) lack of awareness, cost avoidance, insufficient technical expertise, and lack of market incentives</p>

<p><li><b>Products should be secured during all stages of the lifecycle.</b> Devices that are vulnerable at time of deployment, lack facilities to patch vulnerabilities after discovery, or remain in service after vendor support ends make assembling automated, distributed threats far too easy.</p>

<p><li><b>Awareness and education are needed.</b> Home users and some enterprise customers are often unaware of the role their devices could play in a botnet attack and may not fully understand the merits of available technical controls. Product developers, manufacturers, and infrastructure operators often lack the knowledge and skills necessary to deploy tools, processes, and practices that would make the ecosystem more resilient.</p>

<p><li><b>Market incentives should be more effectively aligned.</b> Market incentives do not currently appear to align with the goal of "dramatically reducing threats perpetrated by automated and distributed attacks." Product developers, manufacturers, and vendors are motivated to minimize cost and time to market, rather than to build in security or offer efficient security updates. Market incentives must be realigned to promote a better balance between security and convenience when developing products.</p>

<p><li><b>Automated, distributed attacks are an ecosystem-wide challenge.</b> No single stakeholder community can address the problem in isolation.</ol></p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The Departments identified five complementary and mutually supportive goals that, if realized, would dramatically reduce the threat of automated, distributed attacks and improve the resilience and redundancy of the ecosystem. A list of suggested actions for key stakeholders reinforces each goal. The goals are:</p>

<ul><li>Goal 1: Identify a clear pathway toward an adaptable, sustainable, and secure technology marketplace.
<li>Goal 2: Promote innovation in the infrastructure for dynamic adaptation to evolving threats.
<li>Goal 3: Promote innovation at the edge of the network to prevent, detect, and mitigate automated, distributed attacks.
<li>Goal 4: Promote and support coalitions between the security, infrastructure, and operational technology communities domestically and around the world
<li>Goal 5: Increase awareness and education across the ecosystem.</ul></blockquote>

	    <p>Ross Anderson has a new paper on cryptocurrency exchanges. From <a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2018/06/01/bitcoin-redux-crypto-crime-and-how-to-tackle-it/">his blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://weis2018.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/05/WEIS_2018_paper_38.pdf">Bitcoin Redux</a> explains what's going wrong in the world of cryptocurrencies. The bitcoin exchanges are developing into a shadow banking system, which do not give their customers actual bitcoin but rather display a "balance" and allow them to transact with others. However if Alice sends Bob a bitcoin, and they're both customers of the same exchange, it just adjusts their balances rather than doing anything on the blockchain. This is an e-money service, according to European law, but is the law enforced? Not where it matters. We've been looking at the details.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>It's really hard to estimate the cost of an insecure Internet. Studies are all over the map. A methodical study by RAND is the best work I've seen at trying to put a number on this. The results are, well, all over the map:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2299.html">Estimating the Global Cost of Cyber Risk: Methodology and Examples</a>":

<p><b>Abstract</b>: There is marked variability from study to study in the estimated direct and systemic costs of cyber incidents, which is further complicated by the considerable variation in cyber risk in different countries and industry sectors. This report shares a transparent and adaptable methodology for estimating present and future global costs of cyber risk that acknowledges the considerable uncertainty in the frequencies and costs of cyber incidents. Specifically, this methodology (1) identifies the value at risk by country and industry sector; (2) computes direct costs by considering multiple financial exposures for each industry sector and the fraction of each exposure that is potentially at risk to cyber incidents; and (3) computes the systemic costs of cyber risk between industry sectors using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development input, output, and value-added data across sectors in more than 60 countries. The report has a companion Excel-based modeling and simulation platform that allows users to alter assumptions and investigate a wide variety of research questions. The authors used a literature review and data to create multiple sample sets of parameters. They then ran a set of case studies to show the model's functionality and to compare the results against those in the existing literature. The resulting values are highly sensitive to input parameters; for instance, the global cost of cyber crime has direct gross domestic product (GDP) costs of $275 billion to $6.6 trillion and total GDP costs (direct plus systemic) of $799 billion to $22.5 trillion (1.1 to 32.4 percent of GDP).</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TL281.html">Here's</a> Rand's risk calculator, if you want to play with the parameters yourself.</p>

<p>Note: I was an advisor to the project.</p>

<p>Separately, Symantec has <a href="https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/about/2017-ncsir-global-results-en.pdf">published</a> a new cybercrime report with their own statistics.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011997"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/programmers_who.html">Programmers Who Don't Understand Security Are Poor at Security</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-shows-programmers-will-take-the-easy-way-out-and-not-implement-proper-password-security/">university study</a> confirmed the obvious: if you pay a random bunch of freelance programmers a small amount of money to write security software, they're not going to do a very good job at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>In an experiment that involved 43 programmers hired via the Freelancer.com platform, University of Bonn academics have discovered that developers tend to take the easy way out and write code that stores user passwords in an unsafe manner.

<p>For their study, the German academics asked a group of 260 Java programmers to write a user registration system for a fake social network.</p>

<p>Of the 260 developers, only 43 took up the job, which involved using technologies such as Java, JSF, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL to create the user registration component.</p>

<p>Of the 43, academics paid half of the group with â¬100, and the other half with â¬200, to determine if higher pay made a difference in the implementation of password security features.</p>

<p>Further, they divided the developer group a second time, prompting half of the developers to store passwords in a secure manner, and leaving the other half to store passwords in their preferred method -- hence forming four quarters of developers paid â¬100 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P100), developers paid â¬200 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P200), devs paid â¬100 but not prompted for password security (N100), and those paid â¬200 but not prompted for password security (N200).</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't know why anyone would expect this group of people to implement a good secure password system. Look at how they were hired. Look at the scope of the project. Look at what they were paid. I'm sure they grabbed the first thing they found on GitHub that did the job.</p>

<p>I'm not very impressed with the study or its conclusions.</p>

	    <p>Interesting research: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06542.pdf">Dancing Pigs or Externalities? Measuring the Rationality of<br />
Security Decisions</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Accurately modeling human decision-making in security is critical to thinking about when, why, and how to recommend that users adopt certain secure behaviors. In this work, we conduct behavioral economics experiments to model the rationality of end-user security decision-making in a realistic online experimental system simulating a bank account. We ask participants to make a financially impactful security choice, in the face of transparent risks of account compromise and benefits offered by an optional security behavior (two-factor authentication). We measure the cost and utility of adopting the security behavior via measurements of time spent executing the behavior and estimates of the participant's wage. We find that more than 50% of our participants made rational (e.g., utility optimal) decisions, and we find that participants are more likely to behave rationally in the face of higher risk. Additionally, we find that users' decisions can be modeled well as a function of past behavior (anchoring effects), knowledge of costs, and to a lesser extent, users' awareness of risks and context (R<sup>2</sup>=0.61). We also find evidence of endowment effects, as seen in other areas of economic and psychological decision-science literature, in our digital-security setting. Finally, using our data, we show theoretically that a "one-size-fits-all" emphasis on security can lead to market losses, but that adoption by a subset of users with higher risks or lower costs can lead to market gains</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Here's some interesting research about how we perceive threats. Basically, as the environment becomes safer we basically manufacture new threats. From an <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-your-brain-never-runs-out-of-problems-to-find-98990">essay</a> about the research:</p>

<blockquote><p>To study how concepts change when they become less common, we brought volunteers into <a href="http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/%7Edtg/gilbert.htm">our laboratory</a> and gave them a simple task Â­-- to look at a series of computer-generated faces and decide which ones seem "threatening." The faces had been <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0032335">carefully designed by researchers</a> to range from very intimidating to very harmless.

<p>As we showed people fewer and fewer threatening faces over time, we found that they expanded their definition of "threatening" to include a wider range of faces. In other words, when they ran out of threatening faces to find, they started calling faces threatening that they used to call harmless. Rather than being a consistent category, what people considered "threats" depended on how many threats they had seen lately.</p></blockquote>

<p>This has a lot of implications in security systems where humans have to make judgments about threat and risk: TSA agents, police noticing "suspicious" activities, "see something say something" campaigns, and so on.</p>

	    <p>We all know that it happens: when we see a security warning too often -- and without effect -- we start tuning it out. A <a href="https://neurosecurity.byu.edu/media/Vance_et_al._2017_MISQ.pdf">new paper</a> uses fMRI, eye tracking, and field studies to prove it.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (6/6): This <a href="https://neurosecurity.byu.edu/misq-longitudinal-2018/">blog post</a> summarizes the findings.</p>

	    <p>I'm at Carnegie Mellon University, at the eleventh <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/SHB2018/index.htm">Workshop on Security and Human Behavior</a>.</p>

<p>SHB is a small invitational gathering of people studying various aspects of the human side of security, organized each year by Alessandro Acquisti, Ross Anderson, and myself. The 50 or so people in the room include psychologists, economists, computer security researchers, sociologists, political scientists, neuroscientists, designers, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, business school professors, and a smattering of others. It's not just an interdisciplinary event; most of the people here are individually interdisciplinary.</p>

<p>The goal is to maximize discussion and interaction. We do that by putting everyone on panels, and limiting talks to 7-10 minutes. The rest of the time is left to open discussion. Four hour-and-a-half panels per day over two days equals eight panels; six people per panel means that 48 people get to speak. We also have lunches, dinners, and receptions -- all designed so people from different disciplines talk to each other.</p>

<p>I invariably find this to be the most intellectually stimulating conference of my year. It influences my thinking in many different, and sometimes surprising, ways.</p>

<p>This year's program is <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/SHB2018/program.htm">here</a>. <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/SHB2018/participants.htm">This page</a> lists the participants and includes links to some of their work. As he does every year, Ross Anderson is <a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2018/05/24/security-and-human-behavior-2018/#respond">liveblogging the talks</a>. (Ross also maintains a good webpage of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/psysec.html">psychology and security resources</a>.)</p>

	    <p>Fascinating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/13/the-scientists-persuading-terrorists-to-spill-their-secrets">article</a> about two psychologists who are studying interrogation techniques.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, two British researchers are quietly revolutionising the study and practice of interrogation. Earlier this year, in a meeting room at the University of Liverpool, I watched a video of the Diola interview alongside Laurence Alison, the university's chair of forensic psychology, and Emily Alison, a professional counsellor. My permission to view the tape was negotiated with the counter-terrorist police, who are understandably wary of allowing outsiders access to such material. Details of the interview have been changed to protect the identity of the officers involved, though the quotes are verbatim.

<p>The Alisons, husband and wife, have done something no scholars of interrogation have been able to do before. Working in close cooperation with the police, who allowed them access to more than 1,000 hours of tapes, they have observed and analysed hundreds of real-world interviews with terrorists suspected of serious crimes. No researcher in the world has ever laid hands on such a haul of data before. Based on this research, they have constructed the world's first empirically grounded and comprehensive model of interrogation tactics.</p>

<p>The Alisons' findings are changing the way law enforcement and security agencies approach the delicate and vital task of gathering human intelligence. "I get very little, if any, pushback from practitioners when I present the Alisons' work," said Kleinman, who now teaches interrogation tactics to military and police officers. "Even those who don't have a clue about the scientific method, it just resonates with them." The Alisons have done more than strengthen the hand of advocates of non-coercive interviewing: they have provided an unprecedentedly authoritative account of what works and what does not, rooted in a profound understanding of human relations. That they have been able to do so is testament to a joint preoccupation with police interviews that stretches back more than 20 years.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Interesting research from <i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>: "<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3">The devoted actor's will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Frontline investigations with fighters against the Islamic State (ISIL or ISIS), combined with multiple online studies, address willingness to fight and die in intergroup conflict. The general focus is on non-utilitarian aspects of human conflict, which combatants themselves deem 'sacred' or 'spiritual', whether secular or religious. Here we investigate two key components of a theoretical framework we call 'the devoted actor' -- sacred values and identity fusion with a groupÂ­ -- to better understand people's willingness to make costly sacrifices. We reveal three crucial factors: commitment to non-negotiable sacred values and the groups that the actors are wholly fused with; readiness to forsake kin for those values; and perceived spiritual strength of ingroup versus foes as more important than relative material strength. We directly relate expressed willingness for action to behaviour as a check on claims that decisions in extreme conflicts are driven by cost-benefit calculations, which may help to inform policy decisions for the common defense. </p></blockquote>

	    <p>I hesitate to blog this, because it's an example of everything that's wrong with pop psychology.  Malcolm Harris writes about millennials, and has a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/06/09/why-do-millennials-keep-leaking-government-secrets/">theory</a> of why millennials leak secrets. My guess is that you could write a similar essay about every named generation, every age group, and so on.</p>

	    <p>This is an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/how-microsoft-found-a-huawei-driver-that-opened-systems-up-to-attack/">interesting story</a> of a serious vulnerability in a Huawei driver that Microsoft found. The vulnerability is similar in style to the NSA's DOUBLEPULSAR that was leaked by the Shadow Brokers -- believed to be the Russian government -- and it's obvious that this attack copied that technique.</p>

<p>What is less clear is whether the vulnerability -- which has been fixed -- was put into the Huwei driver accidentally or on purpose.</p>

	    <p>The Daily Beast is <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-intercept-shuts-down-access-to-snowden-trove">reporting</a> that First Look Media -- home of The Intercept and Glenn Greenwald -- is shutting down access to the Snowden archives.</p>

<p>The Intercept was the home for Greenwald's subset of Snowden's NSA documents since 2014, after he parted ways with the <em>Guardian</em> the year before. I don't know the details of how the archive was stored, but it was offline and well secured -- and it was available to journalists for research purposes. Many stories were published based on those archives over the years, albeit fewer in recent years.</p>

<p>The article doesn't say what "shutting down access" means, but my guess is that it means that First Look Media will no longer make the archive available to outside journalists, and probably not to staff journalists, either. Reading between the lines, I think they will delete what they have.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that we're done with the documents. Glenn Greenwald <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1106015482598043648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Both Laura & I have full copies of the archives, as do others. The Intercept has given full access to multiple media orgs, reporters & researchers. I've been looking for the right partner -- an academic institution or research facility -- that has the funds to robustly publish.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm sure there are still stories in those NSA documents, but with many of them a decade or more old, they are increasingly history and decreasingly current events. Every capability discussed in the documents needs to be read with a "and then they had ten years to improve this" mentality.</p>

<p>Eventually it'll all become public, but not before it is 100% history and 0% current events.</p>

	    <p>Really interesting <a href="https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/jfq/jfq-92/jfq-92.pdf">article by and interview with</a> Paul M. Nakasone (Commander of US Cyber Command, Director of the National Security Agency, and Chief of the Central Security Service) in the current issue of <i>Joint Forces Quarterly</i>. He talks about the evolving role of US Cyber Command, and its new posture of "persistent engagement" using a "cyber-persistant force."</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>We must "defend forward" in cyberspace, as we do in the physical domains. Our naval forces do not defend by staying in port, and our airpower does not remain at airfields. They patrol the seas and skies to ensure they are positioned to defend our country before our borders are crossed. The same logic applies in cyberspace. Persistent engagement of our adversaries in cyberspace cannot be successful if our actions are limited to DOD networks. To defend critical military and national interests, our forces must operate against our enemies on their virtual territory as well. Shifting from a response outlook to a persistence force that defends forward moves our cyber capabilities out of their virtual garrisons, adopting a posture that matches the cyberspace operational environment.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the interview:</p>

<blockquote><p>As we think about cyberspace, we should agree on a few foundational concepts. First, our nation is in constant contact with its adversaries; we're not waiting for adversaries to come to us. Our adversaries understand this, and they are always working to improve that contact. Second, our security is challenged in cyberspace. We have to actively defend; we have to conduct reconnaissance; we have to understand where our adversary is and his capabilities; and we have to understand their intent. Third, superiority in cyberspace is temporary; we may achieve it for a period of time, but it's ephemeral. That's why we must operate continuously to seize and maintain the initiative in the face of persistent threats. Why do the threats persist in cyberspace? They persist because the barriers to entry are low and the capabilities are rapidly available and can be easily repurposed. Fourth, in this domain, the advantage favors those who have initiative. If we want to have an advantage in cyberspace, we have to actively work to either improve our defenses, create new accesses, or upgrade our capabilities. This is a domain that requires constant action because we're going to get reactions from our adversary.

<p>[...]</p>

<p><i>Persistent engagement</i> is the concept that states we are in constant contact with our adversaries in cyberspace, and success is determined by how we <i>enable</i> and <i>act</i>. In persistent engagement, we <i>enable</i> other interagency partners. Whether it's the FBI or DHS, we enable them with information or intelligence to share with elements of the CIKR [critical infrastructure and key resources] or with select private-sector companies. The recent midterm elections is an example of how we enabled our partners. As part of the Russia Small Group, USCYBERCOM and the National Security Agency [NSA] enabled the FBI and DHS to prevent interference and influence operations aimed at our political processes. Enabling our partners is two-thirds of persistent engagement. The other third rests with our ability to act -- that is, how we act against our adversaries in cyberspace. Acting includes defending forward. How do we warn, how do we influence our adversaries, how do we position ourselves in case we have to achieve outcomes in the future? Acting is the concept of operating outside our borders, being outside our networks, to ensure that we understand what our adversaries are doing. If we find ourselves defending inside our own networks, we have lost the initiative and the advantage. </p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The concept of persistent engagement has to be teamed with "persistent presence" and "persistent innovation." Persistent presence is what the Intelligence Community is able to provide us to better understand and track our adversaries in cyberspace. The other piece is persistent innovation. In the last couple of years, we have learned that capabilities rapidly change; accesses are tenuous; and tools, techniques, and tradecraft must evolve to keep pace with our adversaries. We rely on operational structures that are enabled with the rapid development of capabilities. Let me offer an example regarding the need for rapid change in technologies. Compare the air and cyberspace domains. Weapons like JDAMs [Joint Direct Attack Munitions] are an important armament for air operations. How long are those JDAMs good for? Perhaps 5, 10, or 15 years, some-times longer given the adversary. When we buy a capability or tool for cyberspace...we rarely get a prolonged use we can measure in years. Our capabilities rarely last 6 months, let alone 6 years. This is a big difference in two important domains of future conflict. Thus, we will need formations that have ready access to developers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Solely from a military perspective, these are obviously the right things to be doing. From a societal perspective -- from the perspective a potential arms race -- I'm much less sure. I'm also worried about the singular focus on nation-state actors in an environment where capabilities diffuse so quickly. But Cyber Command's job is not cybersecurity and resilience.</p>

<p>The whole thing is worth reading, regardless of whether you agree or disagree.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the NSA's "<a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2014/03/20/hunt-sys-admins/">I Hunt Sysadmins</a>" presentation, published by the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/03/20/inside-nsa-secret-efforts-hunt-hack-system-administrators/"><i>Intercept</i></a>.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011893"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/12/massive_ad_frau.html">Massive Ad Fraud Scheme Relied on BGP Hijacking</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>This is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/12/how-3ves-bgp-hijackers-eluded-the-internet-and-made-29m/">really interesting story</a> of an ad fraud scheme that relied on hijacking the Border Gateway Protocol:</p>

<blockquote><p>Members of 3ve (pronounced "eve") used their large reservoir of trusted IP addresses to conceal a fraud that otherwise would have been easy for advertisers to detect. The scheme employed a thousand servers hosted inside data centers to impersonate real human beings who purportedly "viewed" ads that were hosted on bogus pages run by the scammers themselvesÂ­ -- who then received a check from ad networks for these billions of fake ad impressions. Normally, a scam of this magnitude coming from such a small pool of server-hosted bots would have stuck out to defrauded advertisers. To camouflage the scam, 3ve operators funneled the servers' fraudulent page requests through millions of compromised IP addresses.

<p>About one million of those IP addresses belonged to computers, primarily based in the US and the UK, that attackers had infected with botnet software strains known as Boaxxe and Kovter. But at the scale employed by 3ve, not even that number of IP addresses was enough. And that's where the BGP hijacking came in. The hijacking gave 3ve a nearly <i>limitless</i> supply of high-value IP addresses. Combined with the botnets, the ruse made it seem like millions of real people from some of the most affluent parts of the world were viewing the ads.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lots of details in the article.</p>

<p>An aphorism I often use in my talks is "expertise flows downhill: today's top-secret NSA programs become tomorrow's PhD theses and the next day's hacking tools." This is an example of that. BGP hacking -- known as "<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/07/more_on_the_nsa_2.html">traffic shaping</a>" inside the NSA -- has <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/10/chinas_hacking_.html">long been a tool</a> of national intelligence agencies. Now it is being used by cybercriminals.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (1/2): Classified NSA presentation on "<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2919677-Network-Shaping-101.html">network shaping</a>." I don't know if there is a difference inside the NSA between the two terms.</p>

	    <p>The US <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/">Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board </a>is <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/executive-director/">looking</a> for a director. Among other things, this board has some oversight role over the NSA. More precisely, it can examine what any executive-branch agency is doing about counterterrorism. So it can examine the program of TSA watchlists, NSA anti-terrorism surveillance, and FBI counterterrorism activities.</p>

<p>The PCLOB was established in 2004 (when it didn't do much), disappeared from 2007-2012, and reconstituted in 2012. It issued a <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/library/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Records_Program.pdf">major report</a> on NSA surveillance in 2014. It has dwindled since then, having as few as one member. Last month, the Senate <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/senate-confirms-three-pclob-members-ahead-of-privacy-shield-second-annual-review/">confirmed</a> three new members, including Ed Felten.</p>

<p>So, potentially an important job if anyone out there is interested.</p>

	    <p>Noted conspiracy theorist John McAfee <a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The "Presidential alerts": they are capable of accessing the E911 chip in your phones -- giving them full access to your location, microphone, camera and every function of your phone. This not a rant, this is from me, still one of the leading cybersecurity experts. Wake up people!</p></blockquote>

<p>This is, of course, ridiculous. I don't even know what an "E911 chip" is. And -- honestly -- if the NSA wanted in your phone, they would be a lot more subtle than this.</p>

<p>RT has <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/440333-mcafee-warning-government-spying/">picked up the story</a>, though.</p>

<p>(If they just called it a "FEMA Alert," there would be a lot less stress about the whole thing.)</p>

	    <p>Interesting <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-l-a-s-anti-terrorist-subway-scanners-be-adopted-everywhere/">article</a> on terahertz millimeter-wave scanners and their uses to detect terrorist bombers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The heart of the device is a block of electronics about the size of a 1990s tower personal computer. It comes housed in a musician's black case, akin to the one Spinal Tap might use on tour. At the front: a large, square white plate, the terahertz camera and, just above it, an ordinary closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera. Mounted on a shelf inside the case is a laptop that displays the CCTV image and the blobby terahertz image side by side.

<p>An operator compares the two images as people flow past, looking for unexplained dark areas that could represent firearms or suicide vests. Most images that might be mistaken for a weaponÂ­ -- backpacks or a big patch of sweat on the back of a person's shirtÂ­ -- are easily evaluated by observing the terahertz image alongside an unaltered video picture of the passenger.</p>

<p>It is up to the operatorÂ­ -- in LA's case, presumably a transport police officerÂ­ -- to query people when dark areas on the terahertz image suggest concealed large weapons or suicide vests. The device cannot see inside bodies, backpacks or shoes. "If you look at previous incidents on public transit systems, this technology would have detected those," Sotero says, noting LA Metro worked "closely" with the TSA for over a year to test this and other technologies. "It definitely has the backing of TSA."</p>

<p>How the technology works in practice depends heavily on the operator's training. According to Evans, "A lot of tradecraft goes into understanding where the threat item is likely to be on the body." He sees the crucial role played by the operator as giving back control to security guards and allowing them to use their common sense.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am quoted in the article as being skeptical of the technology, particularly how its deployed.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011678"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/08/dont_fear_the_t.html">Don't Fear the TSA Cutting Airport Security. Be Glad That They're Talking about It.</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Last week, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/tsa-considering-eliminating-screening-at-smaller-airports/index.html">CNN reported</a> that the Transportation Security Administration is considering eliminating security at U.S. airports that fly only smaller planes -- 60 seats or fewer. Passengers connecting to larger planes would clear security at their destinations.</p>

<p>To be clear, the TSA has put forth no concrete proposal. The internal agency working group's report obtained by CNN contains no recommendations. It's nothing more than 20 people examining the potential security risks of the policy change. It's not even new: The TSA considered this back in 2011, and the agency reviews its security policies every year. But commentary around the news has been <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/02/politics/tsa-airport-security/index.html">strongly negative</a>. Regardless of the idea's merit, it will almost certainly not happen. That's the result of politics, not security: Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of numerous outraged lawmakers, has already penned a letter to the agency saying that "TSA documents proposing to scrap critical passenger security screenings, without so much as a metal detector in place in some airports, would effectively clear the runway for potential terrorist attacks." He continued, "It simply boggles the mind to even think that the TSA has plans like this on paper in the first place."</p>

<p>We don't know enough to conclude whether this is a good idea, but it shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. We need to evaluate airport security based on concrete costs and benefits, and not continue to implement <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/beyond_fear/">security theater</a> based on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/01/stop_the_panic_on_ai.html">fear</a>. And we should applaud the agency's willingness to explore changes in the screening process.</p>

<p>There is already a tiered system for airport security, varying for both airports and passengers. Many people are enrolled in TSA PreCheck, allowing them to go through checkpoints faster and with less screening. Smaller airports don't have modern screening equipment like full-body scanners or CT baggage screeners, making it impossible for them to detect some plastic explosives. Any would-be terrorist is already able to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/01/profiling_makes_us_l.html">pick and choose</a> his flight conditions to suit his plot.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/12/why_the_tsa_cant_bac.html">written</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/11/a_waste_of_money_and.html">many</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2015/06/why_are_we_spending_.html">essays</a> critical of the TSA and airport security, in general. Most of it is security theater -- measures that make us feel safer without improving security. For example, the liquids ban makes no sense as implemented, because there's <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/10/time_to_show_bottle.html">no penalty for repeatedly trying</a> to evade the scanners. The full-body scanners are <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/12/hiding_petn_fro.html">terrible</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/german_tv_on_th.html">at</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/12/why_the_tsa_cant_bac.html">detecting</a> the explosive material PETN if it is well concealed -- which is their whole point.</p>

<p>There are two basic kinds of terrorists. The amateurs will be deterred or detected by even basic security measures. The professionals will figure out how to evade even the most stringent measures. I've <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/11/the-things-he-carried/307057/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/harms_of_post-9.html">said</a> that the two things that have made flying safer since 9/11 are reinforcing the cockpit doors and persuading passengers that they need to fight back. Everything beyond that isn't worth it.</p>

<p>It's always possible to increase security by adding more onerous -- and expensive -- procedures. If that were the only concern, we would all be strip-searched and prohibited from traveling with luggage. Realistically, we need to analyze whether the increased security of any measure is worth the cost, in money, time and convenience. We <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/21/tsa-spending-3-d-scanners/447410002/">spend $8 billion a year</a> on the TSA, and we'd like to get the most security possible for that money.</p>

<p>This is exactly what that TSA working group was doing. CNN <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/tsa-considering-eliminating-screening-at-smaller-airports/index.html">reported</a> that the group specifically evaluated the costs and benefits of eliminating security at minor airports, saving $115 million a year with a "small (nonzero) undesirable increase in risk related to additional adversary opportunity." That money could be used to bolster security at larger airports or to reduce threats totally removed from airports.</p>

<p>We need more of this kind of thinking, not less. In 2017, political scientists Mark Stewart and John Mueller published a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Are-Safe-Enough-Measuring-Assessing/dp/0128114754/">detailed evaluation</a> of airport security measures based on the cost to implement and the benefit in terms of lives saved. They concluded that most of what our government does either isn't effective at preventing terrorism or is simply too expensive to justify the security it does provide. Others might disagree with their conclusions, but their analysis provides enough detailed information to have a meaningful argument.</p>

<p>The more we politicize security, the worse we are. People are generally <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/05/psychology_of_securi.html">terrible</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/03/why_the_human_brain.html">judges</a> of risk. We fear threats in the news <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2012/07/drawing_the_wrong_le.html">out of proportion</a> with the actual dangers. We overestimate rare and spectacular risks, and underestimate commonplace ones. We fear specific "<a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2005/09/terrorists_dont_do_m.html">movie-plot threats</a>" that we can bring to mind. That's why we fear flying over driving, even though the latter kills about 35,000 people each year -- about a 9/11's worth of deaths each month. And it's why the idea of the TSA eliminating security at minor airports fills us with fear. We can imagine the plot unfolding, only without Bruce Willis saving the day.</p>

<p>Very little today is immune to politics, including the TSA. It drove most of the agency's decisions in the early years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That the TSA is willing to consider politically unpopular ideas is a credit to the organization. Let's let them perform their analyses in peace.</p>

	    <p>The Department of Homeland Security is <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/11/news/laptop-ban-europe-trump/">rumored</a> to be considering extending the current travel ban on large electronics for Middle Eastern flights to European ones as well. The likely reaction of airlines will be to implement new traveler programs, effectively allowing wealthier and more frequent fliers to bring their computers with them. This will only exacerbate the divide between the haves and the have-nots -- all without making us any safer.</p>

<p>In March, both the United States and the United Kingdom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/us/politics/tsa-ban-electronics-laptops-cabin.html">required</a> that passengers from 10 Muslim countries give up their laptop computers and larger tablets, and put them in checked baggage. The new measure was based on reports that terrorists would try to smuggle bombs onto planes concealed in these larger electronic devices.</p>

<p>The security measure <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/22/opinions/puzzling-out-tsa-laptop-ban/">made no sense</a> for two reasons. First, moving these computers into the baggage holds doesn't keep them off planes. Yes, it is easier to detonate a bomb that's in your hands than to remotely trigger it in the cargo hold. But it's also more effective to screen laptops at security checkpoints than it is to place them in checked baggage. TSA already does this kind of screening randomly and occasionally: making passengers turn laptops on to ensure that they're functional computers and not just bomb-filled cases, and running chemical tests on their surface to detect explosive material.</p>

<p>And, two, banning laptops on selected flights just forces terrorists to buy more roundabout itineraries. It doesn't take much creativity to fly Doha-Amsterdam-New York instead of direct. Adding Amsterdam to the list of affected airports makes the terrorist add yet another itinerary change; it doesn't remove the threat.</p>

<p>Which brings up another question: If this is truly a threat, why aren't domestic flights included in this ban? Remember that anyone boarding a plane to the United States from these Muslim countries has already received a visa to enter the country. This isn't perfect security -- the infamous underwear bomber had a visa, after all -- but anyone who could detonate a laptop bomb on his international flight could do it on his domestic connection.</p>

<p>I don't have access to classified intelligence, and I can't comment on whether explosive-filled laptops are truly a threat. But, if they are, TSA can set up additional security screenings at the gates of US-bound flights worldwide and screen every laptop coming onto the plane. It wouldn't be the first time we've had additional security screening at the gate. And they should require all laptops to go through this screening, prohibiting them from being stashed in checked baggage.</p>

<p>This measure is nothing more than <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2009/11/beyond_security_thea.html">security theater</a> against what appears to be a movie-plot threat.</p>

<p>Banishing laptops to the cargo holds brings with it a host of other threats. Passengers run the risk of their electronics being stolen from their checked baggage -- something that has happened in the past. And, depending on the country, passengers also have to worry about border control officials<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/new-laptop-ban-adds-travelers-lack-privacy-and-security"> intercepting checked laptops</a> and making copies of what's on their hard drives.</p>

<p>Safety is another concern. We're already worried about large lithium-ion batteries catching fire in airplane baggage holds; adding a few hundred of these devices will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-15/brace-for-chaos-if-u-s-expands-airline-laptop-ban">considerably exacerbate</a> the risk. Both FedEx and UPS no longer accept bulk shipments of these batteries after two jets crashed in 2010 and 2011 due to combustion.</p>

<p>Of course, passengers will rebel against this rule. Having access to a computer on these long transatlantic flights is a must for many travelers, especially the high-revenue business-class travelers. They also won't accept the delays and confusion this rule will cause as it's rolled out. Unhappy passengers fly less, or fly other routes on other airlines without these restrictions.</p>

<p>I don't know how many passengers are choosing to fly to the Middle East via Toronto to avoid the current laptop ban, but I suspect there may be some. If Europe is included in the new ban, many more may consider adding Canada to their itineraries, as well as choosing European hubs that remain unaffected.</p>

<p>As passengers voice their disapproval with their wallets, airlines will rebel. Already Emirates has a program to <a href="https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-introduces-tablet-loan-service-to-us-bound-first-and-business-class-customers#">loan laptops</a> to their premium travelers. I can imagine US airlines doing the same, although probably for an extra fee. We might learn how to make this work: keeping our data in the cloud or on portable memory sticks and using unfamiliar computers for the length of the flight.</p>

<p>A more likely response will be comparable to what happened after the US increased passenger screening post-9/11. In the months and years that followed, we saw different ways for high-revenue travelers to avoid the lines: faster first-class lanes, and then the extra-cost trusted traveler programs that allow people to bypass the long lines, keep their shoes on their feet and leave their laptops and liquids in their bags. It's a <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2004/08/an_easy_path_for_ter.html">bad security idea</a>, but it keeps both frequent fliers and airlines happy. It would be just another step to allow these people to keep their electronics with them on their flight.</p>

<p>The problem with this response is that it solves the problem for frequent fliers, while leaving everyone else to suffer. This is already the case; those of us enrolled in a trusted traveler program forget what it's like to go through "normal" security screening. And since frequent fliers -- likely to be more wealthy -- no longer see the problem, they don't have any incentive to fix it.</p>

<p>Dividing security checks into haves and have-nots is bad social policy, and we should actively fight any expansion of it. If the TSA implements this security procedure, it should implement it for every flight. And there should be no exceptions. Force every politically connected flier, from members of Congress to the lobbyists that influence them, to do without their laptops on planes. Let the TSA explain to them why they can't work on their flights to and from D.C.</p>

	    <p>I've been reading a bunch of <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2017/05/paper-products-new-tsa-security/">anecdotal reports</a> that the TSA is starting to scan paper separately:</p>

<blockquote><p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/68l7n1/new_airport_security_procedures_paper_products/">passenger</a> going through security at Kansas City International Airport (MCI) recently was asked by security officers to remove all paper products from his bag. Everything from books to Post-It Notes, documents and more. Once the paper products were removed, the passenger had to put them in a separate bin to be scanned separately.

<p>When the passenger inquired why he was being forced to remove the paper products from his carry-on bag, the agent told him that it was a pilot program that's being tested at MCI and will begin rolling out nationwide. <a href="http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/kci-passengers-say-security-asked-them-to-remove-all-paper-items-from-bags"><i>KSHB Kansas City</i></a> is reporting that other passengers traveling through MCI have also reported the paper-removal procedure at the airport. One person said that security dug through the suitcase for two "blocks" of Post-It Notes at the bottom.</p></blockquote>

<p>Does anyone have any guesses as to why the TSA is doing this?</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (5/11): <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article148384019.html">This article</a> says that the TSA has stopped doing this. They blamed it on their contractor, Akai Security.<br />

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011083"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/03/the_tsas_select.html">The TSA's Selective Laptop Ban</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Last Monday, the TSA <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/20/news/companies/middle-east-airline-electronics-ban">announced</a> a peculiar new security measure to take effect within 96 hours. Passengers flying into the US on foreign airlines from eight Muslim countries would be prohibited from carrying aboard any electronics larger than a smartphone. They would have to be checked and put into the cargo hold. And now the UK is following suit.</p>

<p>It's difficult to make sense of this as a security measure, particularly at a time when many people question the veracity of government orders, but other explanations are either unsatisfying or damning.</p>

<p>So let's look at the security aspects of this first. Laptop computers aren't inherently dangerous, but they're convenient carrying boxes. This is why, in the past, TSA officials have demanded passengers turn their laptops on: to confirm that they're actually laptops and not laptop cases emptied of their electronics and then filled with explosives.</p>

<p>Forcing a would-be bomber to put larger laptops in the plane's hold is a reasonable defense against this threat, because it increases the complexity of the plot. Both the shoe-bomber Richard Reid and the underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab carried crude bombs aboard their planes with the plan to set them off manually once aloft. Setting off a bomb in checked baggage is more work, which is why we don't see more midair explosions like Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.</p>

<p>Security measures that restrict what passengers can carry onto planes are not unprecedented either. Airport security regularly responds to both actual attacks and intelligence regarding future attacks. After the liquid bombers were captured in 2006, the British banned all carry-on luggage except passports and wallets. I remember talking with a friend who traveled home from London with his daughters in those early weeks of the ban. They reported that airport security officials confiscated every tube of lip balm they tried to hide.</p>

<p>Similarly, the US started checking shoes after Reid, installed full-body scanners after Abdulmutallab and restricted liquids in 2006. But all of those measures were global, and most lessened in severity as the threat diminished.</p>

<p>This current restriction implies some specific intelligence of a laptop-based plot and a temporary ban to address it. However, if that's the case, why only certain non-US carriers? And why only certain airports? Terrorists are smart enough to put a laptop bomb in checked baggage from the Middle East to Europe and then carry it on from Europe to the US.</p>

<p>Why not require passengers to turn their laptops on as they go through security? That would be a more effective security measure than forcing them to check them in their luggage. And lastly, why is there a delay between the ban being announced and it taking effect?</p>

<p>Even more confusing, the <i>New York Times</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/us/politics/tsa-ban-electronics-laptops-cabin.html">reported</a> that "officials called the directive an attempt to address gaps in foreign airport security, and said it was not based on any specific or credible threat of an imminent attack." The Department of Homeland Security FAQ page makes this <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/03/21/qa-aviation-security-enhancements-select-last-point-departure-airports-commercial">general statement</a>, "Yes, intelligence is one aspect of every security-related decision," but doesn't provide a specific security threat. And yet a report from the UK <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/uk-us-flight-ban-laptops-electronic-devices-donald-trump-muslim-middle-east-latest-a7641796.html">states</a> the ban "follows the receipt of specific intelligence reports."</p>

<p>Of course, the details are all classified, which leaves all of us security experts scratching our heads. On the face of it, the ban makes little sense.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/21/trump-wont-allow-you-to-use-ipads-or-laptops-on-certain-airlines-heres-the-underlying-story">One analysis</a> painted this as a protectionist measure targeted at the heavily subsidized Middle Eastern airlines by hitting them where it hurts the most: high-paying business class travelers who need their laptops with them on planes to get work done. That reasoning makes more sense than any security-related explanation, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/uk-set-to-ban-laptops-on-flights-from-middle-east-countries">doesn't explain</a> why the British extended the ban to UK carriers as well. Or why this measure won't backfire when those Middle Eastern countries turn around and ban laptops on American carriers in retaliation. And one aviation official told CNN that an intelligence official informed him it was not a "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/21/politics/electronics-ban-devices-explosives-intelligence/">political move</a>."</p>

<p>In the end, national security measures based on secret information require us to trust the government. That trust is at <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx">historic low levels</a> right now, so people both in the US and other countries are <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a69c65f4-0db7-11e7-b030-768954394623">rightly skeptical</a> of the official unsatisfying explanations. The new laptop ban highlights this mistrust.</p>

And the EFF <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/new-laptop-ban-adds-travelers-lack-privacy-and-security">rightly points out</a> that letting a laptop out of your hands and sight is itself a security risk -- for the passenger.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a010946"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/12/security_risks_12.html">Security Risks of TSA PreCheck</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-hawley-tsa-precheck-vulnerabilities-20161223-story.html">wrote</a> an op-ed pointing out the security vulnerabilities in the TSA's PreCheck program:</p>

<blockquote><p>The first vulnerability in the system is its enrollment process, which seeks to verify an applicant's identity.  We know  verification is a challenge: A 2011 Government Accountability Office report on TSA's system for checking airport workers' identities concluded  that it was "not designed to provide reasonable assurance that only qualified applicants" got approved. It's not a stretch to believe a reasonably competent terrorist could construct an identity that would pass PreCheck's front end.

<p>The other step in PreCheck's "intelligence-driven, risk-based security strategy" is absurd on its face: The absence of negative information about  a person doesn't mean he or she is trustworthy. News reports are filled with stories of people who seemed to be perfectly normal right up to the moment they committed a heinous act. There is no screening algorithm and no database check that can accurately predict human behavior -- especially on the scale of millions. It is axiomatic that terrorist organizations recruit operatives who have clean backgrounds and interview well.</p></blockquote>

<p>None of this is news.</p>

<p>Back in 2004, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2004/08/an_easy_path_for_ter.html">wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Imagine you're a terrorist plotter with half a dozen potential terrorists at your disposal. They all apply for a card, and three get one. Guess which are going on the mission? And they'll buy round-trip tickets with credit cards and have a "normal" amount of luggage with them.

<p>What the Trusted Traveler program does is create two different access paths into the airport: high security and low security. The intent is that only good guys will take the low-security path, and the bad guys will be forced to take the high-security path, but it rarely works out that way. You have to assume that the bad guys will find a way to take the low-security path.</p>

<p>The Trusted Traveler program is based on the dangerous myth that terrorists match a particular profile and that we can somehow pick terrorists out of a crowd if we only can identify everyone. That's simply not true. Most of the 9/11 terrorists were unknown and not on any watch list. Timothy McVeigh was an upstanding US citizen before he blew up the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Palestinian suicide bombers in Israel are normal, nondescript people. Intelligence reports indicate that Al Qaeda is recruiting non-Arab terrorists for US operations.</p></blockquote>

<p>I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/01/life_in_the_fast_lan.html">wrote</a> much the same thing in 2007:</p>

<blockquote><p>Background checks are based on the dangerous myth that we can somehow pick terrorists out of a crowd if we could identify everyone. Unfortunately, there isn't any terrorist profile that prescreening can uncover. Timothy McVeigh could probably have gotten one of these cards. So could have Eric Rudolph, the pipe bomber at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. There isn't even a good list of known terrorists to check people against; the government list used by the airlines has been the butt of jokes for years.

<p>And have we forgotten how prevalent identity theft is these days? If you think having a criminal impersonating you to your bank is bad, wait until they start impersonating you to the Transportation Security Administration.</p>

<p>The truth is that whenever you create two paths through security -- a high-security path and a low-security path -- you have to assume that the bad guys will find a way to exploit the low-security path. It may be counterintuitive, but we are all safer if the people chosen for more thorough screening are truly random and not based on an error-filled database or a cursory background check.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a <a href=http://kiphawley.typed.com/blog/precheck-tsas-security-hologram">companion blog post</a>, Hawley has more details about why the program doesn't work:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the sense that PreCheck bars people who were identified by intelligence or law enforcement agencies as possible terrorists, then it was intelligence-driven. But using that standard for PreCheck is ridiculous since those people already get extra screening or are on the No-Fly list. The movie <i>Patriots Day</i>, out now, reminds us of the tragic and preventable Boston Marathon bombing. The FBI sent agents to talk to the Tsarnaev brothers and investigate them as possible terror suspects. And cleared them. Even they did not meet the "intelligence-driven" definition used in PreCheck.

<p>The other problem with "intelligence-driven" in the PreCheck context is that intelligence actually tells us the <i>opposite</i>; specifically that terrorists pick clean operatives. If TSA uses current intelligence to evaluate risk, it would not be out enrolling everybody they can into pre-9/11 security for everybody not flagged by the security services.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hawley and I may agree on the problem, but we have completely opposite solutions. The op-ed was too short to include details, but they're in a companion <a href="http://kiphawley.typed.com/blog/precheck-tsas-security-hologram">blog post</a>. Basically, he wants to screen PreCheck passengers more:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the interests of space, I left out details of what I would suggest as short-and medium-term solutions. Here are a few ideas:

<ul><li>Immediately scrub the PreCheck enrollees for false identities. That can probably be accomplished best and most quickly by getting permission from members, and then using, commercial data. If the results show that PreCheck has already been penetrated, the program should be suspended.

<p><li>Deploy K-9 teams at PreCheck lanes.</p>

<p><li>Use Behaviorally trained officers to interact with and check the credentials of PreCheck passengers.</p>

<p><li>Use Explosives Trace Detection cotton swabs on PreCheck passengers at a much higher rate. Same with removing shoes.</p>

<p><li>Turn on the body scanners and keep them fully utilized.</p>

<p><li>Allow liquids to stay in the carry-on since TSA scanners can detect threat liquids.</p>

<p><li>Work with the airlines to keep the PreCheck experience positive.</p>

<p><li>Work with airports to place PreCheck lanes away from regular checkpoints so as not to diminish lane capacity for non-PreCheck passengers. Rental Car check-in areas could be one alternative. Also, downtown check-in and screening (with secure transport to the airport) is a possibility.<br />
</ul><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>These solutions completely ignore the data from the real-world experiment PreCheck has been. Hawley writes that PreCheck tells us that "terrorists pick clean operatives." That's exactly wrong. PreCheck tells us that, basically, there are no terrorists. If 1) it's an easier way through airport security that terrorists will invariably use, and 2) there have been no instances of terrorists using it in the 10+ years it and its predecessors have been in operation, then the inescapable conclusion is that the threat is minimal.  Instead of screening PreCheck passengers more, we should screen everybody else <i>less</i>. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/hacking_tsa_pre.html">This</a> is me in 2012: "I think the PreCheck level of airport screening is what everyone should get, and that the no-fly list and the photo ID check add nothing to security."</p>

<p>I agree with Hawley that we need to overhaul airport security. Me in 2010: "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/11/22/do-body-scanners-make-us-safer/a-waste-of-money-and-time">Airport security is the last line of defense, and it's not a very good one.</a>" We need to recognize that the <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2015/06/why_are_we_spending_.html">actual risk is much lower than we fear</a>, and ratchet airport security down accordingly. And then we need to continue to invest in <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2009/11/beyond_security_thea.html">investigation and intelligence</a>: security measures that work regardless of the tactic or target.</p>

	    <p>The <i>New York Times</i> wrote a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/01/world/airport-security-around-the-world.html">good piece</a> comparing airport security around the world, and pointing out that moving the security perimeter doesn't make any difference if the attack can occur just outside the perimeter. Mark Stewart has the good quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Perhaps the most cost-effective measure is policing and intelligence -- to stop them before they reach the target," Mr. Stewart said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds like something I would say.</p>

	    <p>Interesting research: Mark G. Stewart and John Mueller, "<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/1313869">Risk-based passenger screening: risk and economic assessment of TSA PreCheck increased security at reduced cost?</a>"</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Executive Summary</b>: The Transportation Security Administration's PreCheck program is risk-based screening that allows passengers assessed as low risk to be directed to expedited, or PreCheck, screening. We begin by modelling the overall system of aviation security by considering all layers of security designed to deter or disrupt a terrorist plot to down an airliner with a passenger-borne bomb. Our analysis suggests that these measures reduce the risk of such an attack by at least 98%. Assuming that the accuracy of Secure Flight may be less than 100% when identifying low and high risk passengers, we then assess the effect of enhanced and expedited (or regular and PreCheck) screening on deterrence and disruption rates. We also evaluate programs that randomly redirect passengers from the PreCheck to the regular lines (random exclusion) and ones that redirect some passengers from regular to PreCheck lines (managed inclusion). We find that, if 50% of passengers are cleared for PreCheck, the additional risk reduction (benefit) due to PreCheck is 0.021% for attacks by lone wolves, and 0.056% for ones by terrorist organisations. If 75% of passengers rather than 50% go through PreCheck, these numbers are 0.017% and 0.044%, still providing a benefit in risk reduction. Under most realistic combinations of parameter values PreCheck actually increases risk reduction, perhaps up to 1%, while under the worst assumptions, it lowers risk reduction only by some 0.1%. Extensive sensitivity analyses suggests that, overall, PreCheck is most likely to have an increase in overall benefit.

<p>The report also finds that adding random exclusion and managed inclusion to the PreCheck program has little effect on the risk reducing capability of PreCheck one way or the other. For example, if 10% of non-PreCheck passengers are randomly sent to the PreCheck line, the program still is delivers  a benefit in risk reduction, and provides an additional savings for TSA of $11 million per year by reducing screening costs -- while at the same time improving security outcomes.</p>

<p>There are also other co-benefits, and these are very substantial. Reducing checkpoint queuing times improves in the passenger experience, which would lead to higher airline revenues, can exceed several billion dollars per year. TSA PreCheck thus seems likely to bring considerable efficiencies to the screening process and great benefits to passengers, airports, and airlines while actually enhancing security a bit.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>A proposed law in Albany, NY, would <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Advocacy-groups-criticize-proposed-security-7941060.php">make it a crime</a> to walk away from airport screening.</p>

<p>Aside from wondering why county lawmakers are getting involved with what should be national policy, you have to ask: what are these people thinking?</p>

<p>They're thinking in stories, of course. They have a movie plot in their heads, and they are imaging how this measure solves it.</p>

<blockquote><p>The law is intended to cover what Apple described as a soft spot in the current system that allows passengers to walk away without boarding their flights if security staff flags them for additional scrutiny.

<p>That could include would-be terrorists probing for weaknesses, Apple said, adding that his deputies currently have no legal grounds to question such a person.</p></blockquote>

<p>Does anyone have any idea what stories these people have in their heads? What sorts of security weaknesses are exposed by walking up to airport security and then walking away?</p>

	    <p>An economics professor was detained when he was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/rampage/wp/2016/05/07/ivy-league-economist-interrogated-for-doing-math-on-american-airlines-flight/">spotted doing math</a> on an airplane:</p>

<blockquote><p>On Thursday evening, a 40-year-old man Â­-- with dark, curly hair, olive skin and an exotic foreign accent --Â­ boarded a plane. It was a regional jet making a short, uneventful hop from Philadelphia to nearby Syracuse.

<p>Or so dozens of unsuspecting passengers thought.</p>

<p>The curly-haired man tried to keep to himself, intently if inscrutably scribbling on a notepad he'd brought aboard. His seatmate, a blond-haired, 30-something woman sporting flip-flops and a red tote bag, looked him over. He was wearing navy Diesel jeans and a red Lacoste sweater -- a look he would later describe as "simple elegance" -- but something about him didn't seem right to her.</p>

<p>She decided to try out some small talk.</p>

<p>Is Syracuse home? She asked.</p>

<p>No, he replied curtly.</p>

<p>He similarly deflected further questions. He appeared laser-focused Â­-- perhaps too laser-focused Â­-- on the task at hand, those strange scribblings.</p>

<p>Rebuffed, the woman began reading her book. Or pretending to read, anyway. Shortly after boarding had finished, she flagged down a flight attendant and handed that crew-member a note of her own.</p></blockquote>

<p>This story ended better than some. Economics professor Guido Menzio (yes, he's Italian) was taken off the plane, questioned, cleared, and allowed to board with the rest of his passengers two hours later.</p>

<p>This is a result of our stupid "see something, say something" culture. As I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/11/how_we_won_the_war_o.html">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/05/if_you_see_some.html">say</a>: "If you ask amateurs to act as front-line security personnel, you shouldn't be surprised when you get amateur security."</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/05/economist-removed-from-plane-for-algebra.html">other hand</a>, "Algebra, of course, does have Arabic origins plus math is used to make bombs." Plus, this <a ref="http://viewfromthewing.boardingarea.com/2003/07/04/this-piece-of-news-just-emailed-to-me/">fine joke</a> from 2003:</p>

<blockquote><p>At Heathrow Airport today, an individual, later discovered to be a school teacher, was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a compass, a protractor, and a graphical calculator.

<p>Authorities believe she is a member of the notorious al-Gebra movement. She is being charged with carrying weapons of math instruction.</p></blockquote>

<p>AP <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2016-05-07/professors-airplane-math-didnt-equal-airplane-threat">story</a>. Slashdot <a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/16/05/07/2334259/airline-delays-flight-over-passengers-suspicious-math-equations">thread</a>.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, I worry that this kind of thing will happen to me. I'm older, and I'm not <i>very</i> Semitic looking, but I am curt to my seatmates and intently focused on what I am doing -- which sometimes involves looking at web pages about, and writing about, security and terrorism. I'm sure I'm vaguely suspicious.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD: Last month a student was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/us/student-speaking-arabic-removed-southwest-airlines-plane.html">removed from an airplane</a> for speaking Arabic.</p>

	    <p>Not email, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/nyregion/mailbox-theft-fishing.html">paper mail</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thieves, often at night, use string to lower glue-covered rodent traps or bottles coated with an adhesive down the chute of a sidewalk mailbox. This bait attaches to the envelopes inside, and the fish in this case -- mail containing gift cards, money orders or checks, which can be altered with chemicals and cashed -- are reeled out slowly.</p></blockquote>

<p>In response, the US Post Office is introducing a more secure mailbox:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mail slots are only large enough for letters, meaning sending even small packages will require a trip to the post office. The opening is also equipped with a mechanism that grabs at a letter once inserted, making it difficult to retract.</p></blockquote>

<p>The crime has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/nyregion/new-york-ny-mailbox-theft.html">more common</a> in the past few years.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011575"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/05/maliciously_cha.html">Maliciously Changing Someone's Address</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Someone <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-ups-scam-investigation-20180417-story.html">changed</a> the address of UPS corporate headquarters to his own apartment in Chicago. The company discovered it three months later.</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that in the US there isn't any authentication of change-of-address submissions:</p>

<blockquote><p>According to the Postal Service, nearly 37 million change-of-address requests Â­ known as PS Form 3575 Â­ were submitted in 2017. The form, which can be filled out in person or online, includes a warning below the signature line that "anyone submitting false or inaccurate information" could be subject to fines and imprisonment.

<p>To cut down on possible fraud, post offices send a validation letter to both an old and new address when a change is filed. The letter includes a toll-free number to call to report anything suspicious.</p>

<p>Each year, only a tiny fraction of the requests are ever referred to postal inspectors for investigation. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service could not provide a specific number to the Tribune, but officials have previously said that the number of change-of-address investigations in a given year totals 1,000 or fewer typically.</p>

<p>While fraud involving change-of-address forms has long been linked to identity thieves, the targets are usually unsuspecting individuals, not massive corporations.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>It's not a great solution, but it's  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-facebook/facebook-plans-to-use-u-s-mail-to-verify-ids-of-election-ad-buyers-idUSKCN1G10VD">something</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The process of using postcards containing a specific code will be required for advertising that mentions a specific candidate running for a federal office, Katie Harbath, Facebook's global director of policy programs, said. The requirement will not apply to issue-based political ads, she said.

<p>"If you run an ad mentioning a candidate, we are going to mail you a postcard and you will have to use that code to prove you are in the United States," Harbath said at a weekend conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State, where executives from Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google also spoke.</p>

<p>"It won't solve everything," Harbath said in a brief interview with Reuters following her remarks.</p>

<p>But sending codes through old-fashioned mail was the most effective method the tech company could come up with to prevent Russians and other bad actors from purchasing ads while posing as someone else, Harbath said.</p></blockquote>

<p>It does mean a several-days delay between purchasing an ad and seeing it run.</p>

	    <p>I've <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/05/mail_cover.html">previously written</a> about mail cover -- the practice of recording the data on mail envelopes. Sai has been <a href="http://s.ai/foia#smc">covering the issue</a> in more detail, and recently received an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzmetJxi-p0VOExOZGo2V1ktWHM/view">unredacted copy</a> of a 2014 audit report. The <i>New York Times</i> has an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/us/copy-of-postal-service-audit-shows-extent-of-mail-surveillance.html">article</a> on it:</p>

<blockquote><p>In addition to raising privacy concerns, the audit questioned the Postal Service's efficiency and accuracy in handling mail cover requests. Many requests were processed late, the audit said, which delayed surveillance, and computer errors caused the same tracking number to be assigned to different requests.

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The inspector general also found that the Postal Inspection Service did not have "sufficient controls" in place to ensure that its employees followed the agency's policies in handling the national security mail covers.</p>

<p>According to the audit, about 10 percent of requests did not include the dates for the period covered by surveillance. Without the dates in the files, auditors were unable to determine if the Postal Service had followed procedures for allowing law enforcement agencies to monitor mail for a specific period of time.</p>

<p>Additionally, 15 percent of the inspectors who handled the mail covers did not have the proper nondisclosure agreements on file for handling classified materials, records that must be maintained for 50 years. The agreements would prohibit the postal workers from discussing classified information.</p>

<p>And the inspector general found that in about 32 percent of cases, postal inspectors did not include, as required, the date on which they visited facilities where mail covers were being processed. In another 32 percent of cases, law enforcement agencies did not return documents to the Postal Inspection Service's Office of Counsel, which handles the national security mail covers, within the prescribed 60 days after a case was closed.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>I could use some help with finding a host for my monthly newsletter, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/">Crypto-Gram</a>.  My old setup just wasn't reliable enough.  I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/crypto-gram_is_.html">had a move planned</a>, but that fell through when the new host's bounce processing system turned out to be buggy and they admitted the problem might never be fixed.</p>

<p>Clearly I need something a lot more serious.  My criteria include subscriber privacy, reasonable cost, and a proven track record of reliability with large mailing lists. (I would use MailChimp, but it has <a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/reports/about-click-tracking#Turn-Click-Tracking-On-or-Off">mandatory click tracking</a> for new accounts.)</p>

<p>One complication is that SpamCop, a popular anti-spam service, tells me I have at least one of their "spamtrap" addresses on the list.  Spamtraps are addresses that -- in theory -- have never been used, so they shouldn't be on any legitimate list.  I don't know how they got on my list, since I make people confirm their subscriptions by replying to an e-mail or clicking on an e-mailed link.  But I used to make rare exceptions for people who just asked to join, so maybe a bad address or two got on that way.  Spamtraps don't work if you tell people what they are, so I can't just find and remove them.  And this has caused no end of problems for subscribers who use SpamCop's blacklist.  </p>

<p>At a minimum, I need to be sure that a new host won't kick me out for couple of spamtraps.  And if the solution to this problem involves making all 100,000 people on the list reconfirm their subscriptions, then that has to be as simple and user-friendly a process as possible.</p>

<p>If you can recommend a host that would work, I'm interested. Even better would be talking to an expert with lots of experience running large mailing lists who can guide me. If you know a person like that, or if you are one, please leave a comment or e-mail me at the address on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/contact.html">my Contact page</a>.<br />

	    <p>The idea is basically to use indirection to hide physical addresses.  You would get a random number to give to your correspondents, and the post office would use that number to determine your real address.  No security against government surveillance, but potentially valuable nonetheless.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://www.prc.gov/Docs/87/87862/sai-paf-proposal-2.pdf">a</a> <a href="http://www.prc.gov/Docs/87/87906/PR%20Motion.pdf">bunch</a> <a href="http://www.prc.gov/Docs/87/87915/sai-paf-motion-supporting-pr-2.pdf">of</a> <a href="http://www.prc.gov/Docs/87/87900/Order%20No.%201838.pdf">documents</a>.</p>

<p>I honestly have no idea what's going on.  It seems to be something the US government is considering, but it was not proposed by the US Postal Service.  <a href="http://s.ai/cv.pdf">This</a> <a href="http://s.ai/presentations">guy</a> is proposing the service.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (10/11):  Sai has contacted me and asked that people refrain from linking to or writing about this for now, until he posts some more/better information. I'll update this post with a new link when he sends it to me.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (10/17):  Sai has again contacted me, saying that he has posted the more/better information, and that the one true link for the proposal is <a href="http://s.ai/paf/">here</a>.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412009001834?np=y">This paper</a> (full paper behind paywall) -- from <i>Environment International</i> (2009) -- does a good job of separating fact from fiction:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>:  In recent years there has been an increased concern regarding the potential use of chemical and biological weapons for mass urban terror. In particular, there are concerns that ricin could be employed as such an agent. This has been reinforced by recent high profile cases involving ricin, and its use during the cold war to assassinate a high profile communist dissident. Nevertheless, despite these events, does it deserve such a reputation? Ricin is clearly toxic, though its level of risk depends on the route of entry. By ingestion, the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract where it may cause mucosal injuries; with appropriate treatment, most patients will make a full recovery. As an agent of terror, it could be used to contaminate an urban water supply, with the intent of causing lethality in a large urban population. However, a substantial mass of pure ricin powder would be required. Such an exercise would be impossible to achieve covertly and would not guarantee success due to variables such as reticulation management, chlorination, mixing, bacterial degradation and ultra-violet light. By injection, ricin is lethal; however, while parenteral delivery is an ideal route for assassination, it is not realistic for an urban population. Dermal absorption of ricin has not been demonstrated. Ricin is also lethal by inhalation. Low doses can lead to progressive and diffuse pulmonary oedema with associated inflammation and necrosis of the alveolar pneumocytes. However, the risk of toxicity is dependent on the aerodynamic equivalent diameter (AED) of the ricin particles. The AED, which is an indicator of the aerodynamic behaviour of a particle, must be of sufficiently low micron size as to target the human alveoli and thereby cause major toxic effects. To target a large population would also necessitate a quantity of powder in excess of several metric tons. The technical and logistical skills required to formulate such a mass of powder to the required size is beyond the ability of terrorists who typically operate out of a kitchen in a small urban dwelling or in a small ill-equipped laboratory. Ricin as a toxin is deadly but as an agent of bioterror it is unsuitable and therefore does not deserve the press attention and subsequent public alarm that has been created.</p></blockquote>

<p>FWIW, Windows 10 has something built in that will erese the laptop and remove all of your apps and personal data.  </p>

<p>They have an option that's slow enough to make me think it's overwriting the empty parts of the file system, although I haven't verified that.</p>

<p>I spent about 5 years trying to convince a computer repair shop I worked at to overwrite drives on machines we refurbished instead of a simple format and reload. "It is too complicated." was the answer. I left because of the increasingly shady business practices, but I also know first hand they were one of the better ones in the area.</p>

<p>Makes a good case nowdays to just use only ssd's with data security erase feature built into the firmware.  With that, you can securely erase a terabyte drive in a few minutes, since the drive's internal representation is encrypted anyway all they need to do is destroy the key securely.  </p>

<p>I have used encryption on my backup server for over 15 years, so I can offsite store old drives for archival and not worry about data theft during physical transit or physical storage.  It has the additional nice feature that if I keep the key on a separate device, I can remotely erase an unmounted and unpowered drive by securely erasing the key, which is much faster than wiping a disk would ever be.<br />

<p>Is there a good reason why it's still possible to buy portable devices which don't store everything bar the decryption key encrypted, and then destroy the key on too many access attempts?  I'm sure there must be.</p>

<p>We have several business sectors where they need a certificate of destruction for every storage device that is abandoned.</p>

<p>Physical shredding is the best answer, as there are quite some methods to retrieve overwritten data like realigning the read head to read the residu signal.</p>

<p>I can't say I'm surprised. People still use 123456 as password, type passwords in public places and even on national TV (to be fair that password was 123qwe :))</p>

<p>@Rj and @tfb</p>

<p>Just keep in mind that your "encryption = unreachable" idea only works for as long as that encryption scheme is secure.</p>

<p>The best one can hope for in that circumstance is that that will buy you enough time to denature all of the data on the hard drive (make it unuseful to anybody who might want it).</p>

<p>I saw they recommend using a drill press to destroy drives.  I've been arguing that this only destroys part of the data on the drive, not all the data as NIST would require us to do.  Shouldn't one render all the platter unreadable, not just part?</p>

"Physical shredding is the best answer."<br />
Yes, in particular for non-magnetic media which could not be degaussed.<br />
May be melting in microwave oven or dissolving chemically are other options.<br />
Shredded pieces should be as small as possible.</p>

<p>For SSDs and spinning disks these days, dd is your BFF. You can use it to write zeroes to all normally writable bits on an SSD or spinning disk, and for most uses that is sufficient. </p>

<p>If anyone wants to get data from those devices after that, it will take a lot more technical resources than the typical cyber criminal gang: And if someone with the kind of resources needed is after you, then you have bigger problems.</p>

<p>I read the article but I don't grok powershell.  Is the author claiming these files weren't even "erased"?  That seems incredible to me.  I've obtained used hardware and had to at least run testdisk/photorec on reformatted hard drives.</p>

<p>@Phaete: Please correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding was that reconstruction of the contents of a zeroed drive from their magnetic remnants was a purely theoretical attack, and that no one has ever actually reconstructed a file from a zeroed drive this way. Can you point me to an example of someone actually doing it?</p>

<p>Re: Physical destruction -- Although nasty fumes are involved, I'd think that burning to ash/melting to liquid would be more absolutely certain than shredding. (Although reassembling/mapping a shredded drive sounds to me like science fiction, so it hardly matters.)</p>

<p>You don't need to pay for shredding for HDs with ceramic platters. A solid hammer blow to the case will shatter them into a million pieces. Hear a tinkling sound like broken glass when you shake it? Yeah, that drive's done.</p>

<p>@Rj: My understanding is that SSD firmware "secure erase" features (and SSD firmware in general) are often poorly implemented (and the key may not be stored securely in the first place). Moreover, they're all proprietary and unauditable, so I wouldn't trust them.</p>

<p>@JohnnyS: The problem with securely deleting SSDs (assuming their "secure delete" function is inadequate) is that they've got a whole bunch of unprovisioned blocks that they use for scratch space during delete operations, rotating in and out of provisioned space for wear leveling, and replacing provisioned blocks when a cell fails and goes read-only. Nothing you can do from the OS level, including dd, can force a delete of the unprovisioned blocks. You can't even force a delete of the provisioned blocks since the controller may just swap them out and flag them for later deletion. But they can be read by unsoldering the flash modules or hooking the drive up to a board that <a href="https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2019/01/life-after-trim-using-factory-access-mode-for-imaging-ssd-drives/" rel="nofollow">forces it into factory mode</a>. If your data is also encrypted in software (e.g., LUKS, VeraCrypt), the worst case scenario is a copy of an old header with a compromised password lingering on where you can't delete it. If you're not, the worst case scenario is your most sensitive file lingering on where you can't delete it. (Note: Bitlocker uses hardware encryption when it can. Also, Microsoft has your key...)</p>

<p>@Phaete & H.S. Newman:</p>

<p>Physical shredding is expensive, and most data just isn't worth that much to attempt to recall.  Putting a good-sized (say, half-inch) diameter hole in a platter is, if nothing else, guaranteed to make sure it'll never spin again (and what a flying read head does when it hits a hole is not something I think they'd appreciate).</p>

<p>True, if you were the CIA and the disk held Russian nuclear weapons data, shredding (and then incinerating, and then mixing up the ashes - USA Classified SOP) would be better, but knocking a hole in the platters will, generally, work just fine.  Also is a lot cheaper, faster, and can be done with stuff from Home Depot.  Metal shredders are specialty equipment.  A drill press (or even a hand drill) isn't.</p>

<p>Bending the platters is another fun way of making sure they'll never spin again.  Yeah, they can still be picked over bit by bit microscopically, but that's a gigantic hassle.</p>

<p>More apropos, I am recalling an experience of some years ago when I personally bought a used laptop at a junk store, and noticed rather a lot of crap on the hard drive.  Trying to log in as a 'different user' magically got me all kinds of interesting business information.</p>

<p>I phoned up the business in question, and they sent over someone to make a copy of it all just so they knew what had escaped.</p>

<p>As Mr. Schneier pointed out, this is nothing new...</p>

<p>@MrC</p>

<p>Absolutely agreed. The SSD disks are still at risk even after a good dd wipe. The only mitigating factor is the (current) cost and awkwardness of actually getting into factory mode.</p>

<p>But I'm looking at those devices such as the "PC-3000 Portable System" which can access factory mode and these are little boxes with ports on them: They are expensive, but as we've seen in the past, clever hackers can often replace such systems with open source software solutions. (Example: Asterix replacing Nortel switches, FreeBSD/Dummynet deployments replacing costly WAN simulators, etc.)</p>

<p>So perhaps soon someone will put a Raspberry Pi into a box with the right connectors and be able to use that to access factory mode on SSDs. That may make it worth the effort for a villain to bulk buy used SSDs and look for secrets.</p>

<p>If I want to get rid of an SSD now, I will start with "dd" and end with "Big Hammer".</p>

<p>I was taught this almost 2 decades at a HDD repartitioning software firm.<br />
I never questioned it as it sounded probable and technically correct.<br />
But it actually seems this was only remotely possible with floppies and other low density magnetic storage.<br />

<p>Shredding is only expensive if you don't shop around and use an IT firm or similar for it.<br />
Just drive to a metal recycler firm and ask if you can throw them in the shredder (and possibly film that).<br />

<p>I work for a big online retailer who just migrated their data warehouse from Oracle to their own internal services (no points for guessing who). The decommissioning of the old hardware that Oracle was running on required the physical destruction of over 100,000 spinning disks. Things like these are huge programs which take an insane amount of money and time. The actual destruction and certification will take several months.</p>

<p>@ALL:</p>

<p>There are a number of sides to this argument that are often not mentioned but are realy the root of the problem.</p>

<p>The first thing people want is not to loose the use of things and the easy way to do that as in life is 'keep copies of everything'.</p>

<p>The second is people want fast response out of their computers, the easy way to do that as in life is not wasting time 'throwing out the garbage'.</p>

<p>The third is as in life it takes way longer to put things away in an organised way than it does to 'just put things anywhere'</p>

<p>Importantly though it takes much more time to put things away when as in life you start to 'run out of unused space'.</p>

<p>With the cost of storage droping to the point it only makes sense to price it in Giga (thousands of millions) or Tera (millions of millions) bytes. Thus you can see why, from a user perspective,</p>

<p>1, Data duplication is good.<br />
2, Not house keeping is good.<br />
3, Unorganised storage is good.<br />
4, More storage is good.</p>

<p>Now lets look from the data confidentiality perspective,</p>

<p>1, Data duplication is bad.<br />
2, Not house keeping is bad.<br />
3, Unorganised storage is bad.<br />
4, More storage is bad.</p>

<p>Thus in theory 'What the market wants the market gets'. The reality is though 'What producers marketing people think is good is what gets made'. As the marketers look for 'mass market' as they are easier to sell into niche / specialized / minority markets either don't get produced for or if they do at a disproportianatly high premium.</p>

<p>So if you want reasonable levels of confidentiality / privacy / security / secrecy or what supports it, you have to in effect pay a lot more if there is a product, or go without and thus have to make your own mitigations if there is not.</p>

<p>Which brings about the question of knowledge... Put your hand up if you think you can cover all the bases in the 'required mitigations' for the entire life cycle...</p>

<p>You might have noticed I'm very firmly sitting on my hands... That's because I don't believe anybody can 'cover all the bases' not even a large team of experts. In fact every one should think likewise, because of times arrow.</p>

<p>Lets just assume that you know --which you actually can not-- all the classes of vulnerability there are out there. Lets also assume that by some magical process you could cover them all today, what about tomorow or the day after?</p>

<p>The point is the defenders are allways working in the past and the attackers in the future, which leaves a gap you just can not cover.</p>

<p>The only thing you can do is mitigate as broadly as you can the known classes of attack and keep your fingers crossed.</p>

<p>The broadest form of mitigation is segregation, not just seperation or authenticated access control.</p>

<p>History shows that segregation of any form is hard and the greater the complexity of any system the harder it is.</p>

<p>Thus you have to look at the very fundementals of the system break it into parts minimize not just the complexity within those parts but flows of information into and out of them.</p>

<p>So saying things like 'Full Disk Encryption at the disk' is insufficient because the implication is 'one key' which 'all users need access too to use the system'. Further the key is in use as long as any of the data is in use. Which is why FDE or other Disk Level Encryption only protects when the drive is not in use and the keys have been securely deleted.</p>

<p>The problem is for most systems you can buy the keys are not securely deleted or worse they are not securely generated. Humans are realy bad at remembering things accurately even four digit PINs defete many people every day. Thus the chance of remembering 256bits of truley random data is in reality a compleate non starter. So FDE like most encryption just moves the problem somewhere else, it does not actually mitigate it let alone solve it.</p>

<p>Just about every mitigation you try to come up with either is totaly ineffective such as 'security by obscurity' or it pushes the problem else where.</p>

<p>The problem with pushing the problem elsewhere is it creates new communications channels be they informational or physical. In either case they need to be made secure which just increases the complexity, thus likelihood of introducing a vulnerability.</p>

<p>Many years ago now our host @Bruce Schneier mad the observation that as far as encryption was concerned we had sufficiently secure algorithms, what we needed to do was go on and work on sorting out the key managment issues.</p>

<p>To be honest since then I don't realy think there has been much effort let alown significant solutions found. We've primarily ended up with some lowest common denominator solution of CAs. Using asymetric encryption in vulnerable hierarchical human systems, which have compleatly unsuprisingly, have failed repeatably as history had shown they probably would. But to make it worse the ideas of David Deutsch appear to being getting ever closer to fruition. If they do then our current asymetric public key algorithms become very vulnerable...</p>

<p>Thus even though we can see an entirely new class of vulnerability approaching us, we have no choice yet, but to build systems around what we have even though the predictions are it will be vulnerable long before it's expected service life is over.</p>

<p>Thus we actually know we can not realistically have confidentiality now or in the future without some other way more physical mitigations.</p>

<p>Thus information storage needs to be in a vault, and storage that is broken or at it's end of life needs some realy serious 'ashes to ashes, dust to dust' treatment.</p>

<p>Boy scouts used to get told that before leaving their campsite to 'Burn, Bash and Bury' their garbage, which in many ways was sound advice. These days they are told to push the problem somewhere else, much as we do these days in the ICT industry thus our information 'gets recycled'...</p>

<p>Time to start the forge and get the hammer out, carbon footprint be damed, go have some excercise if not fun ;-)</p>

<p>@1&1~=Umm</p>

<p>For what itâs worth ...</p>

<p>Could user friendly data versioning address points 1-3 ?</p>

<p>E.g., 1., no need to explicitly duplicate with another file, just keep committing your updates to the file in question. For 2., 3., the versioning db does the housekeeping and organizing; the accounting problem reduces since there is basically only one of each thing, leaving the more natural, non-computer problem of conceptual relationships and their implied organization, i.e., what/why is something âa oneâ and not a heap.</p>

<p>This relieves the burden on the user of managing the multiplicity in the change history of data, and so frees mental and creative energy for paying attention to content management. Itâs the content that is important. The âfilesâ are a machine organizing method but itâs not clear why users need to know about them: the userâs point of view is content. E.g., one is naturally tempted to duplicate files, but it is not possible to duplicate content. One might change content; the versioning will make this safe. </p>

<p>Footnotes and details to follow ...</p>

<p>Let's say I have a dark view of security these days, and I think that not clearing disk drives is least of our worries. Bottom line: if you don't want it seen by somebody don't put it on a computer. If you do put it on a computer assume someone other than you  is seeing it. Probably many someones.</p>

<p>@Coyne Tibbets:</p>

<p>"Let's say I have a dark view of security these days..."</p>

<p>But is it dark enough?</p>

<p>I think it was @Nick P who said don't use Intel hardware made after 2005. And others said use only hardware from 'before the turn of the century' but did not say which ;-)</p>

<p>I guess the real question is not what hardware 'they' might have targeted / got into, but which hardware 'they' have not got around to yet.</p>

<p>It's a fair bet that both Intel and AMD have been 'got at' and with ARM having Chinese Interests hanging around it via a Japanese company these days, there is the other 'theys' to consider.</p>

<p>Also with the runaway success of the Raspberry Pi foundation what have the secretive Broadcom been upto...</p>

<p>So how about MIPS 32 or 64?</p>

<p>This is a little over three years old,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mips.com/blog/can-it-run-bsd-the-story-of-a-mips-based-pic32-microcontroller/" rel="nofollow">https://www.mips.com/blog/can-it-run-bsd-the-story-of-a-mips-based-pic32-microcontroller/</a></p>

<p>There is a list of supported hardware for BSD 4.4 at,</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sergev/LiteBSD/wiki" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sergev/LiteBSD/wiki</a></p>

<p>With this board,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/PIC/Development/PIC32-HMZ144/open-source-hardware" rel="nofollow">https://www.olimex.com/Products/PIC/Development/PIC32-HMZ144/open-source-hardware</a></p>

<p>Being only 22Euros and easily made ready for a prototype board to add extra goodies on. From the blurb it should be able to support five other serial interfaces so serial terminals or SPI memory cards. Also 100Mhz ethernet, so connectivity should not be much of an issue. </p>

<p>Oh and there are other suitable PIC MIPS boards designed for Adruno shields to be added.</p>

<h4 class="subtitle">Mark Zuckerberg wants to fix the social network. Hereâs what heâll need to do.</h4>

<p>Facebook is making a new and stronger commitment to privacy. Last month, the company hired three of its most vociferous critics and installed them in senior technical positions. And on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg wrote that the company will pivot to focus on private conversations over the public sharing that has long defined the platform, even while conceding that "frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services."</p>
<p>There is ample reason to question Zuckerberg's pronouncement: The company has madeâand brokenâmany privacy promises over the years. And if you read his 3,000-word post carefully, Zuckerberg says nothing about changing Facebook's surveillance capitalism business model. </p>

<p>The Crypto Wars have been waging off-and-on for a quarter-century. On one side is law enforcement, which wants to be able to break encryption, to access devices and communications of terrorists and criminals. On the other are almost every cryptographer and computer security expert, repeatedly explaining that there's no way to provide this capability without also weakening the security of every user of those devices and communications systems.</p>
<p>It's an impassioned debate, acrimonious at times, but there are real technologies that can be brought to bear on the problem: key-escrow technologies, code obfuscation technologies, and backdoors with different properties. </p>

<p>In his 2008 white paper that first proposed bitcoin, the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto concluded with: "We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust." He was referring to blockchain, the system behind bitcoin cryptocurrency. The circumvention of trust is a great promise, but it's just not true. Yes, bitcoin eliminates certain trusted intermediaries that are inherent in other payment systems like credit cards. But you still have to trust bitcoinâand everything about it.</p>

<p>Our work in cybersecurity is inexorably intertwined with public policy andâmore generallyâthe public interest. It's obvious in the debates on encryption and vulnerability disclosure, but it's also part of the policy discussions about the Internet of Things, cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, social media platforms, and pretty much everything else related to IT.</p>
<p>This societal dimension to our traditionally technical area is bringing with it a need for public-interest technologists.</p>
<p>Defining this term is difficult. </p>

<p>To better understand influence attacks, we proposed an approach that models democracy itself as an information system and explains how democracies are vulnerable to certain forms of information attacks that autocracies naturally resist. Our model combines ideas from both international security and computer security, avoiding the limitations of both in explaining how influence attacks may damage democracy as a whole.</p>
<p>Our initial account is necessarily limited. Building a truly comprehensive understanding of democracy as an information system will be a Herculean labor, involving the collective endeavors of political scientists and theorists, computer scientists, scholars of complexity, and others.</p>

<p>The so-called Crypto Wars have been going on for 25 years now. Basically, the FBIâand some of their peer agencies in the U.K., Australia, and elsewhereâargue that the pervasive use of civilian encryption is hampering their ability to solve crimes and that they need the tech companies to make their systems susceptible to government eavesdroping. Sometimes their complaint is about communications systems, like voice or messaging apps. Sometimes it's about end-user devices. </p>

<p>No one doubts that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will transform cybersecurity. We just don't know how, or when. While the literature generally focuses on the different uses of AI by attackers and defenders â and the resultant arms race between the two â I want to talk about software vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>All software contains bugs. </p>

<p>On November 4, 2016, the hacker &quot;Guccifer 2.0,&quot; a front for Russia's military intelligence service, claimed in a blogpost that the Democrats were likely to use vulnerabilities to hack the presidential elections. On November 9, 2018, President Donald Trump started tweeting about the senatorial elections in Florida and Arizona. Without any evidence whatsoever, he said that Democrats were trying to steal the election through &quot;FRAUD.&quot;</p>

<p>Cybersecurity experts would say that posts like Guccifer 2.0's are intended to undermine public confidence in voting: a cyber-attack against the US democratic system. Yet Donald Trump's actions are doing far more damage to democracy. </p>

<p><em>Excerpted from the upcoming issue of McSweeney's, "The End of Trust," a collection featuring more than 30 writers investigating surveillance, technology, and privacy.</em></p>
<p>In my book <cite>Data and Goliath</cite>, I write about the value of privacy. I talk about how it is essential for political liberty and justice, and for commercial fairness and equality. I talk about how it increases personal freedom and individual autonomy, and how the lack of it makes us all less secure. But this is probably the most important argument as to why society as a whole must protect privacy: it allows society to progress.</p>

<p>Democracy is an information system.</p>
<p>That's the starting place of our new paper: "Common-Knowledge Attacks on Democracy." In it, we look at democracy through the lens of information security, trying to understand the current waves of Internet disinformation attacks. Specifically, we wanted to explain why the same disinformation campaigns that act as a stabilizing influence in Russia are destabilizing in the United States.</p>
<p>The answer revolves around the different ways autocracies and democracies work as information systems. </p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011950"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/blockchain_and_.html">Blockchain and Trust</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>In his 2008 <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">white paper</a> that first proposed <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a>, the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto concluded with: "We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust." He was referring to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-blockchain/">blockchain</a>, the system behind bitcoin cryptocurrency. The circumvention of trust is a great promise, but it's just not true. Yes, bitcoin eliminates certain trusted intermediaries that are inherent in other payment systems like credit cards. But you still have to trust bitcoin -- and everything about it.</p>

<p>Much has been written about <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchains</a> and how they displace, reshape, or eliminate trust. But when you analyze both blockchain and trust, you quickly realize that there is much more hype than value. Blockchain solutions are often much worse than what they replace.</p>

<p>First, a caveat. By blockchain, I mean something very specific: the data structures and protocols that make up a <em>public</em> blockchain. These have three essential elements. The first is a distributed (as in multiple copies) but centralized (as in there's only one) ledger, which is a way of recording what happened and in what order. This ledger is public, meaning that anyone can read it, and immutable, meaning that no one can change what happened in the past.</p>

<p>The second element is the consensus algorithm, which is a way to ensure all the copies of the ledger are the same. This is generally called mining; a critical part of the system is that anyone can participate. It is also distributed, meaning that you don't have to trust any particular node in the consensus network. It can also be extremely expensive, both in data storage and in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-mining-guzzles-energyand-its-carbon-footprint-just-keeps-growing/">energy required</a> to maintain it. Bitcoin has the most expensive consensus algorithm the world has ever seen, by far.</p>

<p>Finally, the third element is the currency. This is some sort of digital token that has value and is publicly traded. Currency is a necessary element of a blockchain to align the incentives of everyone involved. Transactions involving these tokens are stored on the ledger.</p>

<p>Private blockchains are completely uninteresting. (By this, I mean systems that use the blockchain data structure but don't have the above three elements.) In general, they have some external limitation on who can interact with the blockchain and its features. These are not anything new; they're distributed append-only data structures with a list of individuals authorized to add to it. Consensus protocols have been studied in distributed systems for more than 60 years. Append-only data structures have been similarly well covered. They're blockchains in name only, and -- as far as I can tell -- the only reason to operate one is to ride on the blockchain hype.</p>

<p>All three elements of a public blockchain fit together as a single network that offers new security properties. The question is: Is it actually good for anything? It's all a matter of trust.</p>

<p>Trust is essential to society. As a species, humans are wired to trust one another. Society can't function without trust, and the fact that we mostly don't even think about it is a measure of how well trust works.</p>

<p>The word "trust" is loaded with many meanings. There's personal and intimate trust. When we say we trust a friend, we mean that we trust their intentions and know that those intentions will inform their actions. There's also the less intimate, less personal trust -- we might not know someone personally, or know their motivations, but we can trust their future actions. Blockchain enables this sort of trust: We don't know any bitcoin miners, for example, but we trust that they will follow the mining protocol and make the whole system work.</p>

<p>Most blockchain enthusiasts have a unnaturally narrow definition of trust. They're fond of catchphrases like "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/opinion/bitcoin-boom-technology-trust.html">in code we trust</a>," "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Math-We-Trust-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B07C7TPXMD?tag=w050b-20">in math we trust</a>," and "<a href="https://cryptoclothing.org/product/crypto-shirt/">in crypto we trust</a>." This is trust as verification. But verification isn't the same as trust.</p>

<p>In 2012, I wrote a book about trust and security, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/liars_and_outliers/"><em>Liars and Outliers</em></a>. In it, I listed four very general systems our species uses to incentivize trustworthy behavior. The first two are morals and reputation. The problem is that they scale only to a certain population size. Primitive systems were good enough for small communities, but larger communities required delegation, and more formalism.</p>

<p>The third is institutions. Institutions have rules and laws that induce people to behave according to the group norm, imposing sanctions on those who do not. In a sense, laws formalize reputation. Finally, the fourth is security systems. These are the wide varieties of security technologies we employ: door locks and tall fences, alarm systems and guards, forensics and audit systems, and so on.</p>

<p>These four elements work together to enable trust. Take banking, for example. Financial institutions, merchants, and individuals are all concerned with their reputations, which prevents theft and fraud. The laws and regulations surrounding every aspect of banking keep everyone in line, including backstops that limit risks in the case of fraud. And there are lots of security systems in place, from anti-counterfeiting technologies to internet-security technologies.</p>

<p>In his 2018 book, <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/blockchain-and-new-architecture-trust">Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust</a></em>, Kevin Werbach outlines four different "trust architectures." The first is peer-to-peer trust. This basically corresponds to my morals and reputational systems: pairs of people who come to trust each other. His second is leviathan trust, which corresponds to institutional trust. You can see this working in our system of contracts, which allows parties that don't trust each other to enter into an agreement because they both trust that a government system will help resolve disputes. His third is intermediary trust. A good example is the credit card system, which allows untrusting buyers and sellers to engage in commerce. His fourth trust architecture is distributed trust. This is emergent trust in the particular security system that is blockchain.</p>

<p>What blockchain does is <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/who-controls-the-blockchain">shift some of the trust</a> in people and institutions to trust in technology. You need to trust the cryptography, the protocols, the software, the computers and the network. And you need to trust them absolutely, because they're often single points of failure.</p>

<p>When that trust turns out to be misplaced, there is no recourse. If your bitcoin exchange <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">gets hacked</a>, you lose all of your money. If your bitcoin wallet <a href="https://www.ccn.com/breaking-numerous-bitcoin-wallets-may-have-been-compromised-by-rogue-developer">gets hacked</a>, you lose all of your money. If you forget your login credentials, you lose all of your money. If there's a <a href="https://medium.com/new-alchemy/a-short-history-of-smart-contract-hacks-on-ethereum-1a30020b5fd">bug in the code</a> of your smart contract, you lose all of your money. If someone successfully <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/01/08/ethereum-classic-blockchain-su.html">hacks the blockchain security</a>, you lose all of your money. In many ways, trusting technology is harder than trusting people. Would you rather trust a human legal system or the details of some computer code you don't have the expertise to audit?</p>

<p>Blockchain enthusiasts point to more traditional forms of trust -- bank processing fees, for example -- as expensive. But blockchain trust is also costly; <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3074070">the cost is just hidden</a>. For bitcoin, that's the cost of the additional bitcoin mined, the transaction fees, and the enormous environmental waste.</p>

<p>Blockchain doesn't eliminate the need to trust human institutions. There will always be a big gap that can't be addressed by technology alone. People still need to be in charge, and there is always a need for governance outside the system. This is obvious in the ongoing debate about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/22/money-and-politics-bitcoins-governance-crisis/">changing the bitcoin block size</a>, or in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-executes-blockchain-hard-fork-return-dao-investor-funds">fixing the DAO attack</a> against <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/trust-the-inside-story-of-the-rise-and-fall-of-ethereum">Ethereum</a>. There's always a need to override the rules, and there's always a need for the ability to make permanent rules changes. As long as hard forks are a possibility -- that's when the people in charge of a blockchain step outside the system to change it -- people will need to be in charge.</p>

<p>Any blockchain system will have to coexist with other, more conventional systems. Modern banking, for example, is designed to be reversible. Bitcoin is not. That makes it hard to make the two compatible, and the result is often an insecurity. Steve Wozniak was <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/steve-wozniak-had-70000-in-bitcoin-stolen-after-falling-for-a-simple-yet-perfect-scam-2018-02-28">scammed out of $70K</a> in bitcoin because he forgot this.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is often centralized. Bitcoin might theoretically be based on distributed trust, but in practice, that's just not true. Just about everyone using bitcoin has to trust one of the few available wallets and use one of the few available exchanges. People have to trust the software and the operating systems and the computers everything is running on. And we've seen attacks against wallets and exchanges. We've seen Trojans and phishing and password guessing. Criminals have even used flaws in the system that people use to repair their cell phones to steal bitcoin.</p>

<p>Moreover, in any distributed trust system, there are backdoor methods for centralization to creep back in. With bitcoin, there are only a few miners of consequence. There's one company that provides most of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/crypto-mining-giant-bitmain-on-target-for-10b-revenue-this-year/">mining hardware</a>. There are only a few dominant exchanges. To the extent that most people interact with bitcoin, it is through these centralized systems. This also allows for attacks against blockchain-based systems.</p>

<p>These issues are not bugs in current blockchain applications, they're inherent in how blockchain works. Any evaluation of the security of the system has to take the whole socio-technical system into account. Too many blockchain enthusiasts focus on the technology and ignore the rest.</p>

<p>To the extent that people don't use bitcoin, it's because they don't trust bitcoin. That has nothing to do with the cryptography or the protocols. In fact, a system where you can lose your life savings if you forget your key or download a piece of malware is not particularly trustworthy. No amount of explaining how SHA-256 works to prevent <a href="https://medium.com/innerquest-online/how-does-a-blockchain-prevent-double-spending-of-bitcoins-fa0ecf9849f7">double-spending</a> will fix that.</p>

<p>Similarly, to the extent that people do use blockchains, it is because they trust them. People either own bitcoin or not based on reputation; that's true even for speculators who own bitcoin simply because they think it will make them rich quickly. People choose a wallet for their cryptocurrency, and an exchange for their transactions, based on reputation. We even evaluate and trust the cryptography that underpins blockchains based on the algorithms' reputation.</p>

<p>To see how this can fail, look at the various <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/following-a-tuna-from-fiji-to-brooklynon-the-blockchain/">supply-chain security systems</a> that are using blockchain. A blockchain isn't a necessary feature of any of them. The reasons they're successful is that everyone has a single software platform to enter their data in. Even though the blockchain systems are built on distributed trust, people don't necessarily accept that. For example, some companies <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ibm-blockchain-maersk-shipping-struggling">don't trust the IBM/Maersk system</a> because it's not <em>their</em> blockchain.</p>

<p>Irrational? Maybe, but that's how trust works. It can't be replaced by algorithms and protocols. It's much more social than that.</p>

<p>Still, the idea that blockchains can somehow eliminate the need for trust persists. Recently, I received an email from a company that implemented secure messaging using blockchain. It said, in part: "Using the blockchain, as we have done, has eliminated the need for Trust." This sentiment suggests the writer misunderstands both what blockchain does and how trust works.</p>

<p>Do you need a public blockchain? The answer is almost certainly <a href="https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec">no</a>. A blockchain probably doesn't solve the security problems you think it solves. The security problems it solves are probably not the ones you have. (Manipulating audit data is probably not your major security risk.) A false trust in blockchain can itself be a security risk. The inefficiencies, especially in scaling, are probably not worth it. I have looked at many blockchain <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/blockchain-applications">applications</a>, and all of them could achieve the same security properties without using a blockchainÂ­ -- of course, then they wouldn't have the cool name.</p>

<p>Honestly, cryptocurrencies are useless. They're only used by speculators looking for quick riches, people who don't like government-backed currencies, and criminals who want a black-market way to exchange money.</p>

<p>To answer the question of whether the blockchain is needed, ask yourself: Does the blockchain change the system of trust in any meaningful way, or just shift it around? Does it just try to replace trust with verification? Does it strengthen existing trust relationships, or try to go against them? How can trust be abused in the new system, and is this better or worse than the potential abuses in the old system? And lastly: What would your system look like if you didn't use blockchain at all?</p>

<p>If you ask yourself those questions, it's likely you'll choose solutions that don't use public blockchain. And that'll be a good thing -- especially when the hype dissipates.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011757"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/09/evidence_for_th.html">Evidence for the Security of PKCS #1 Digital Signatures</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>This is interesting research: "<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/855">On the Security of the PKCS#1 v1.5 Signature Scheme</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature algorithm is the most widely used digital signature scheme in practice. Its two main strengths are its extreme simplicity, which makes it very easy to implement, and that verification of signatures is significantly faster than for DSA or ECDSA. Despite the huge practical importance of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures, providing formal evidence for their security based on plausible cryptographic hardness assumptions has turned out to be very difficult. Therefore the most recent version of PKCS#1 (RFC 8017) even recommends a replacement the more complex and less efficient scheme RSA-PSS, as it is provably secure and therefore considered more robust. The main obstacle is that RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures use a deterministic padding scheme, which makes standard proof techniques not applicable.

<p>We introduce a new technique that enables the first security proof for RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures. We prove full existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) under the standard RSA assumption. Furthermore, we give a tight proof under the Phi-Hiding assumption. These proofs are in the random oracle model and the parameters deviate slightly from the standard use, because we require a larger output length of the hash function. However, we also show how RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures can be instantiated in practice such that our security proofs apply.</p>

<p>In order to draw a more complete picture of the precise security of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures, we also give security proofs in the standard model, but with respect to weaker attacker models (key-only attacks) and based on known complexity assumptions. The main conclusion of our work is that from a provable security perspective RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 can be safely used, if the output length of the hash function is chosen appropriately.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't think the protocol is "provably secure," meaning that it cannot have any vulnerabilities. What this paper demonstrates is that there are no vulnerabilities under the model of the proof. And, more importantly, that PKCS #1 v1.5 is as secure as any of its successors like <a href="https://rsapss.hboeck.de/rsapss.pdf">RSA-PSS</a> and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/ro.pdf">RSA Full-Domain</a>.</p>

While interesting, it has nothing to do with cryptography. Cryptographers aren't interested in how to find prime numbers, or even in the distribution of prime numbers.

	    <p>Quantum computing is a new way of computing -- one that could allow humankind to perform computations that are simply impossible using today's computing technologies. It allows for very fast searching, something that would break some of the encryption algorithms we use today. And it allows us to easily factor large numbers, something that would break the RSA cryptosystem for any key length.</p>

<p>This is why cryptographers are hard at work designing and analyzing "quantum-resistant" public-key algorithms. Currently, quantum computing is too nascent for cryptographers to be sure of what is secure and what isn't. But even assuming aliens have developed the technology to its full potential, quantum computing doesn't spell the end of the world for cryptography. Symmetric cryptography is easy to make quantum-resistant, and we're working on quantum-resistant public-key algorithms. If public-key cryptography ends up being a temporary anomaly based on our mathematical knowledge and computational ability, we'll still survive. And if some inconceivable alien technology can break all of cryptography, we still can have secrecy based on information theory -- albeit with significant loss of capability.</p>

<p>At its core, cryptography relies on the mathematical quirk that some things are easier to do than to undo. Just as it's easier to smash a plate than to glue all the pieces back together, it's much easier to multiply two prime numbers together to obtain one large number than it is to factor that large number back into two prime numbers. Asymmetries of this kind -- one-way functions and trap-door one-way functions -- underlie all of cryptography.</p>

<p>To encrypt a message, we combine it with a key to form ciphertext. Without the key, reversing the process is more difficult. Not just a little more difficult, but astronomically more difficult. Modern encryption algorithms are so fast that they can secure your entire hard drive without any noticeable slowdown, but that encryption can't be broken before the heat death of the universe.</p>

<p>With symmetric cryptography -- the kind used to encrypt messages, files, and drives -- that imbalance is exponential, and is amplified as the keys get larger. Adding one bit of key increases the complexity of encryption by less than a percent (I'm hand-waving here) but doubles the cost to break. So a 256-bit key might seem only twice as complex as a 128-bit key, but (with our current knowledge of mathematics) it's 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 times harder to break.</p>

<p>Public-key encryption (used primarily for key exchange) and digital signatures are more complicated. Because they rely on hard mathematical problems like factoring, there are more potential tricks to reverse them. So you'll see key lengths of 2,048 bits for RSA, and 384 bits for algorithms based on elliptic curves. Here again, though, the costs to reverse the algorithms with these key lengths are beyond the current reach of humankind.</p>

<p>This one-wayness is based on our mathematical knowledge. When you hear about a cryptographer "breaking" an algorithm, what happened is that they've found a new trick that makes reversing easier. Cryptographers discover new tricks all the time, which is why we tend to use key lengths that are longer than strictly necessary. This is true for both symmetric and public-key algorithms; we're trying to future-proof them.</p>

<p>Quantum computers promise to upend a lot of this. Because of the way they work, they excel at the sorts of computations necessary to reverse these one-way functions. For symmetric cryptography, this isn't too bad. Grover's algorithm shows that a quantum computer speeds up these attacks to effectively halve the key length. This would mean that a 256-bit key is as strong against a quantum computer as a 128-bit key is against a conventional computer; both are secure for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>For public-key cryptography, the results are more dire. Shor's algorithm can easily break all of the commonly used public-key algorithms based on both factoring and the discrete logarithm problem. Doubling the key length increases the difficulty to break by a factor of eight. That's not enough of a sustainable edge.</p>

<p>There are a lot of caveats to those two paragraphs, the biggest of which is that quantum computers capable of doing anything like this don't currently exist, and no one knows when -- or even if Â­- we'll be able to build one. We also don't know what sorts of practical difficulties will arise when we try to implement Grover's or Shor's algorithms for anything but toy key sizes. (Error correction on a quantum computer could easily be an unsurmountable problem.) On the other hand, we don't know what other techniques will be discovered once people start working with actual quantum computers. My bet is that we will overcome the engineering challenges, and that there will be many advances and new techniquesÂ­but they're going to take time to discover and invent. Just as it took decades for us to get supercomputers in our pockets, it will take decades to work through all the engineering problems necessary to build large-enough quantum computers.</p>

<p>In the short term, cryptographers are putting considerable effort into designing and analyzing quantum-resistant algorithms, and those are likely to remain secure for decades. This is a necessarily slow process, as both good cryptanalysis transitioning standards take time. Luckily, we have time. Practical quantum computing seems to always remain "ten years in the future," which means no one has any idea.</p>

<p>After that, though, there is always the possibility that those algorithms will fall to aliens with better quantum techniques. I am less worried about symmetric cryptography, where Grover's algorithm is basically an upper limit on quantum improvements, than I am about public-key algorithms based on number theory, which feel more fragile. It's possible that quantum computers will someday break all of them, even those that today are quantum resistant.</p>

<p>If that happens, we will face a world without strong public-key cryptography. That would be a huge blow to security and would break a lot of stuff we currently do, but we could adapt. In the 1980s, Kerberos was an all-symmetric authentication and encryption system. More recently, the GSM cellular standard does both authentication and key distribution -- at scale -- with only symmetric cryptography. Yes, those systems have centralized points of trust and failure, but it's possible to design other systems that use both secret splitting and secret sharing to minimize that risk. (Imagine that a pair of communicants get a piece of their session key from each of five different key servers.) The ubiquity of communications also makes things easier today. We can use out-of-band protocols where, for example, your phone helps you create a key for your computer. We can use in-person registration for added security, maybe at the store where you buy your smartphone or initialize your Internet service. Advances in hardware may also help to secure keys in this world. I'm not trying to design anything here, only to point out that there are many design possibilities. We know that cryptography is all about trust, and we have a lot more techniques to manage trust than we did in the early years of the Internet. Some important properties like forward secrecy will be blunted and far more complex, but as long as symmetric cryptography still works, we'll still have security.</p>

<p>It's a weird future. Maybe the whole idea of number theoryÂ­-based encryption, which is what our modern public-key systems are, is a temporary detour based on our incomplete model of computing. Now that our model has expanded to include quantum computing, we might end up back to where we were in the late 1970s and early 1980s: symmetric cryptography, code-based cryptography, Merkle hash signatures. That would be both amusing and ironic.</p>

<p>Yes, I know that quantum key distribution is a potential replacement for public-key cryptography. But come on -- does anyone expect a system that requires specialized communications hardware and cables to be useful for anything but niche applications? The future is mobile, always-on, embedded computing devices. Any security for those will necessarily be software only.</p>

<p>There's one more future scenario to consider, one that doesn't require a quantum computer. While there are several mathematical theories that underpin the one-wayness we use in cryptography, proving the validity of those theories is in fact one of the great open problems in computer science. Just as it is possible for a smart cryptographer to find a new trick that makes it easier to break a particular algorithm, we might imagine aliens with sufficient mathematical theory to break all encryption algorithms. To us, today, this is ridiculous. Public- key cryptography is all number theory, and potentially vulnerable to more mathematically inclined aliens. Symmetric cryptography is so much nonlinear muddle, so easy to make more complex, and so easy to increase key length, that this future is unimaginable. Consider an AES variant with a 512-bit block and key size, and 128 rounds. Unless mathematics is fundamentally different than our current understanding, that'll be secure until computers are made of something other than matter and occupy something other than space.</p>

<p>But if the unimaginable happens, that would leave us with cryptography based solely on information theory: one-time pads and their variants. This would be a huge blow to security. One-time pads might be theoretically secure, but in practical terms they are unusable for anything other than specialized niche applications. Today, only crackpots try to build general-use systems based on one-time pads -- and cryptographers laugh at them, because they replace algorithm design problems (easy) with key management and physical security problems (much, much harder). In our alien-ridden science-fiction future, we might have nothing else.</p>

<p>Against these godlike aliens, cryptography will be the only technology we can be sure of. Our nukes might refuse to detonate and our fighter jets might fall out of the sky, but we will still be able to communicate securely using one-time pads. There's an optimism in that.</p>

	    <p>Not email, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/nyregion/mailbox-theft-fishing.html">paper mail</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thieves, often at night, use string to lower glue-covered rodent traps or bottles coated with an adhesive down the chute of a sidewalk mailbox. This bait attaches to the envelopes inside, and the fish in this case -- mail containing gift cards, money orders or checks, which can be altered with chemicals and cashed -- are reeled out slowly.</p></blockquote>

<p>In response, the US Post Office is introducing a more secure mailbox:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mail slots are only large enough for letters, meaning sending even small packages will require a trip to the post office. The opening is also equipped with a mechanism that grabs at a letter once inserted, making it difficult to retract.</p></blockquote>

<p>The crime has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/nyregion/new-york-ny-mailbox-theft.html">more common</a> in the past few years.</p>

	    <p>Stealing packages from unattended porches is a rapidly rising crime, as more of us order more things by mail. One person hid a <a href="https://jonathanturley.org/2018/12/21/former-nasa-engineer-sabotages-thieves-with-glitter-bomb-after-police-refuse-to-help/">glitter bomb</a> and a video recorder in a package, posting the results when thieves opened the box. At least, that's what might have happened. At least some of the video <a href="https://gizmodo.com/viral-video-of-glitter-bomb-for-package-thieves-exposed-1831254130">was faked</a>, which puts the whole thing into question.</p>

<p>That's okay, though. Santa is faked, too. Happy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNvZqpa-7Q">whatever you're celebrating</a>. </p>

	    <p>Kaspersky is <a href="https://securelist.com/darkvishnya/89169/">reporting</a> on a series of bank hacks -- called DarkVishnya -- perpetrated through malicious hardware being surreptitiously installed into the target network:</p>

<blockquote><p>In 2017-2018, Kaspersky Lab specialists were invited to research a series of cybertheft incidents. Each attack had a common springboard: an unknown device directly connected to the company's local network. In some cases, it was the central office, in others a regional office, sometimes located in another country. At least eight banks in Eastern Europe were the targets of the attacks (collectively nicknamed DarkVishnya), which caused damage estimated in the tens of millions of dollars.

<p>Each attack can be divided into several identical stages. At the first stage, a cybercriminal entered the organization's building under the guise of a courier, job seeker, etc., and connected a device to the local network, for example, in one of the meeting rooms. Where possible, the device was hidden or blended into the surroundings, so as not to arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>The devices used in the DarkVishnya attacks varied in accordance with the cybercriminals' abilities and personal preferences. In the cases we researched, it was one of three tools:</p>

<ul><li>netbook or inexpensive laptop
<li>Raspberry Pi computer
<li>Bash Bunny, a special tool for carrying out USB attacks</ul>

<p>Inside the local network, the device appeared as an unknown computer, an external flash drive, or even a keyboard. Combined with the fact that Bash Bunny is comparable in size to a USB flash drive, this seriously complicated the search for the entry point. Remote access to the planted device was via a built-in or USB-connected GPRS/3G/LTE modem.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Modern cars have alarm systems that automatically connect to a remote call center. This makes cars harder to steal, since tripping the alarm causes a quick response. <a href="https://mrooding.me/a-dutch-first-ingenious-bmw-theft-attempt-5f7f49a96ec8">This article</a> describes a theft attempt that tried to neutralize that security system. In the first attack, the thieves just disabled the alarm system and then left. If the owner had not immediately repaired the car, the thieves would have returned the next night and -- no longer working under time pressure -- stolen the car.</p>

	    <p>This is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hackers-reportedly-stole-600-gallons-of-gas-from-detroi-1827433411">weird</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Police in Detroit are looking for two suspects who allegedly managed to hack a gas pump and steal over 600 gallons of gasoline, valued at about $1,800. The theft took place in the middle of the day and went on for about 90 minutes, with the gas station attendant unable to thwart the hackers.

<p>The theft, <a href="http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/thieves-hack-into-detroit-gas-pump-stealing-more-than-600-gallons">reported by Fox 2 Detroit</a>, took place at around 1pm local time on June 23 at a Marathon gas station located about 15 minutes from downtown Detroit. At least 10 cars are believed to have benefitted from the free-flowing gas pump, which still has police befuddled.</p>

<p>Here's what is known about the supposed hack: Per Fox 2 Detroit, the thieves used some sort of remote device that allowed them to hijack the pump and take control away from the gas station employee. Police confirmed to the local publication that the device prevented the clerk from using the gas station's system to shut off the individual pump.</p></blockquote>

<p>Slashdot <a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/18/07/08/2249209/hackers-stole-600-gallons-of-gas-from-detroit-gas-station-report-says">post</a>. </p>

<p>Hard to know what's true, but it seems like a good example of a hack against a cyber-physical system. </p>

	    <p>Ross Anderson has a <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/making-bitcoin-legal.pdf">really interesting paper</a> on tracing stolen bitcoin. From a <a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2018/03/26/tracing-stolen-bitcoin/">blog post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Previous attempts to track tainted coins had used either the "poison" or the "haircut" method. Suppose I open a new address and pay into it three stolen bitcoin followed by seven freshly-mined ones. Then under poison, the output is ten stolen bitcoin, while under haircut it's ten bitcoin that are marked 30% stolen. After thousands of blocks, poison tainting will blacklist millions of addresses, while with haircut the taint gets diffused, so neither is very effective at tracking stolen property. Bitcoin due-diligence services supplant haircut taint tracking with AI/ML, but the results are still not satisfactory.

<p>We discovered that, back in 1816, the High Court had to tackle this problem in Clayton's case, which involved the assets and liabilities of a bank that had gone bust. The court ruled that money must be tracked through accounts on the basis of first-in, first out (FIFO); the first penny into an account goes to satisfy the first withdrawal, and so on.</p>

<p>Ilia Shumailov has written software that applies FIFO tainting to the blockchain and the results are impressive, with a massive improvement in precision. What's more, FIFO taint tracking is lossless, unlike haircut; so in addition to tracking a stolen coin forward to find where it's gone, you can start with any UTXO and trace it backwards to see its entire ancestry. It's not just good law; it's good computer science too.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011452"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/02/jackpotting_att.html">Jackpotting Attacks Against US ATMs</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Brian Krebs is <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/01/first-jackpotting-attacks-hit-u-s-atms/">reporting</a> sophisticated jackpotting attacks against US ATMs. The attacker gains physical access to the ATM, plants malware using specialized electronics, and then later returns and forces the machine to dispense all the cash it has inside.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Secret Service alert explains that the attackers typically use an endoscope -- a slender, flexible instrument traditionally used in medicine to give physicians a look inside the human body -- to locate the internal portion of the cash machine where they can attach a cord that allows them to sync their laptop with the ATM's computer.

<p>"Once this is complete, the ATM is controlled by the fraudsters and the ATM will appear Out of Service to potential customers," reads the confidential Secret Service alert.</p>

<p>At this point, the crook(s) installing the malware will contact co-conspirators who can remotely control the ATMs and force the machines to dispense cash.</p>

<p>"In previous Ploutus.D attacks, the ATM continuously dispensed at a rate of 40 bills every 23 seconds," the alert continues. Once the dispense cycle starts, the only way to stop it is to press cancel on the keypad. Otherwise, the machine is completely emptied of cash, according to the alert.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lots of details in the article.</p>

	    <p>Facebook is making a new and stronger commitment to privacy. Last month, the company <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-hires-privacy-critics/">hired three</a> of its most vociferous critics and installed them in senior technical positions. And on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">wrote</a> that the company will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-privacy.html">pivot</a> to focus on private conversations over the public sharing that has long defined the platform, even while conceding that "frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services."</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/06/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-privacy/">ample</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/opinion/zuckerberg-privacy-facebook.html">reason</a> to question Zuckerberg's pronouncement: The company has made -- <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-03-facebook-history-privacy.html">and broken</a> -- many privacy promises over the years. And if you read his 3,000-word post carefully, Zuckerberg says nothing about changing Facebook's <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/">surveillance capitalism</a> business model. All the post discusses is making private chats more central to the company, which seems to be a play for increased market dominance and to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/07/facebook-privacy-domination">counter</a> the Chinese company WeChat.</p>

<p>In security and privacy, the devil is always in the details -- and Zuckerberg's post provides none. But we'll take him at his word and try to fill in some of the details here. What follows is a list of changes we should expect if Facebook is serious about changing its business model and improving user privacy.</p>

<p><strong>How Facebook treats people on its platform</strong></p>

<p><i>Increased transparency over advertiser and app accesses to user data.</i> Today, Facebook users can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992">download and view</a> much of the data the company has about them. This is important, but it doesn't go far enough. The company could be more transparent about what data it shares with advertisers and others and how it allows advertisers to select users they show ads to. Facebook could use its substantial skills in usability testing to help people understand the mechanisms advertisers use to show them ads or the reasoning behind what it chooses to show in user timelines. It could <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-privacy-optics-clear-history-zuckerberg">deliver on promises</a> in this area.</p>

<p><i>Better -- and more usable -- privacy options.</i> Facebook users have limited control over how their data is shared with other Facebook users and almost no control over how it is shared with Facebook's advertisers, which are the company's real customers. Moreover, the controls are buried deep behind complex and confusing menu options. To be fair, some of this is because privacy is complex, and it's hard to understand the results of different options. But much of this is deliberate; Facebook doesn't want its users to make their data private from other users.</p>

<p>The company could give people better control over how -- and whether -- their data is used, shared, and sold. For example, it could allow users to turn off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/opinion/zuckerberg-facebook-ads.html">individually targeted news and advertising</a>. By this, we don't mean simply making those advertisements invisible; we mean turning off the data flows into those tailoring systems. Finally, since most users stick to the default options when it comes to configuring their apps, a changing Facebook could tilt those defaults toward more privacy, requiring less tailoring most of the time.</p>

<p><i>More user protection from stalking.</i> "Facebook stalking" is often thought of as "stalking light," or "harmless." But stalkers are rarely harmless. Facebook should acknowledge this class of misuse and work with experts to build tools that protect all of its users, especially its most vulnerable ones. Such tools should guide normal people away from creepiness and give victims power and flexibility to enlist aid from sources ranging from advocates to police.</p>

<p><i>Fully ending real-name enforcement.</i> Facebook's real-names policy, requiring people to use their actual legal names on the platform, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/facebook-real-name-policy-hurts-people-creates-new-digital-divide">hurts</a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community">people</a> such as activists, victims of intimate partner violence, police officers whose work makes them targets, and anyone with a public persona who wishes to have control over how they identify to the public. There are many ways Facebook can improve on this, from ending enforcement to allowing verifying pseudonyms for everyoneÂ­ -- not just celebrities like Lady Gaga. Doing so would mark a clear shift.</p>

<p><strong>How Facebook runs its platform</strong></p>

<p><i>Increased transparency of Facebook's business practices.</i> One of the hard things about evaluating Facebook is the effort needed to get good information about its business practices. When violations are exposed by the media, as they regularly are, we are all surprised at the different ways Facebook violates user privacy. Most recently, the company <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzdxjx/facebook-phone-number-two-factor-authentication">used phone numbers</a> provided for two-factor authentication for advertising and networking purposes. Facebook needs to be both explicit and detailed about how and when it shares user data. In fact, a move from discussing "sharing" to discussing "transfers," "access to raw information," and "access to derived information" would be a visible improvement.</p>

<p><i>Increased transparency regarding censorship rules.</i> Facebook <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enforcement-hate-speech-rules-mistakes">makes choices</a> about what content is acceptable on its site. Those choices are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/30/failbook/">controversial</a>, implemented by thousands of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">low-paid workers</a> quickly implementing <a href="https://mashable.com/article/facebook-moderator-sues-ptsd/">unclear rules</a>. These are tremendously <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech">hard problems</a> without clear solutions. Even obvious rules like banning hateful words run into challenges when people try to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/30/failbook/">legitimately</a> discuss certain important topics. Whatever Facebook does in this regard, the company needs be more transparent about its processes. It should allow regulators and the public to audit the company's practices. Moreover, Facebook should share any innovative engineering solutions with the world, much as it currently <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/">shares</a> its data center engineering.</p>

<p><i>Better security for collected user data.</i> There have been numerous examples of attackers targeting cloud service platforms to gain access to user data. Facebook has a large and skilled product security team that <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/designing-security-for-billions/">says some of the right things</a>. That team needs to be involved in the design trade-offs for features and not just review the near-final designs for flaws. Shutting down a feature based on internal security analysis would be a clear message.</p>

<p><i>Better data security so Facebook sees less.</i> Facebook eavesdrops on almost every aspect of its users' lives. On the other hand, WhatsApp -- purchased by Facebook in 2014 -- provides users with end-to-end encrypted messaging. While Facebook knows who is messaging whom and how often, Facebook has no way of learning the contents of those messages. Recently, Facebook announced plans to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-plans-to-merge-whatsapp-messenger-and-instagram-backends-by-2020-reportedly/">combine</a> WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197222/facebook-messenger-instagram-end-to-end-encryption-feature-zuckerberg">extending WhatsApp's security</a> to the consolidated system. Changing course here would be a dramatic and negative signal.</p>

<p><i>Collecting less data from outside of Facebook.</i> Facebook doesn't just collect data about you when you're on the platform. Because its "like" button is on so many other pages, the company can collect data about you when you're not on Facebook. It even collects what it calls "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy">shadow profiles</a>" -- data about you even if you're not a Facebook user. This data is combined with other surveillance data the company buys, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/some-apps-send-data-about-menstruation-home-buying-facebook-wsj-n974711">health</a> and financial data. Collecting and saving less of this data would be a strong indicator of a new direction for the company.</p>

<p><i>Better use of Facebook data to prevent violence.</i> There is a trade-off between Facebook seeing less and Facebook doing more to prevent hateful and inflammatory speech. Dozens of people have been killed by mob violence because of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/on-whatsapp-fake-news-is-fast--and-can-be-fatal/2018/07/23/a2dd7112-8ebf-11e8-bcd5-9d911c784c38_story.html">fake news spread on WhatsApp</a>. If Facebook were doing a convincing job of controlling fake news without end-to-end encryption, then we would expect to hear how it could use patterns in metadata to handle encrypted fake news.</p>

<p><strong>How Facebook manages for privacy</strong></p>

<p><i>Create a team measured on privacy and trust.</i> Where companies spend their money tells you what matters to them. Facebook has a large and important <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40432085/how-facebooks-growth-team-used-science-and-empathy-to-reach-two-billion-users">growth team</a>, but what team, if any, is responsible for privacy, not as a matter of compliance or pushing the rules, but for engineering? Transparency in how it is staffed relative to other teams would be telling.</p>

<p><i>Hire a senior executive responsible for trust.</i> Facebook's current team has been focused on growth and revenue. Its one chief security officer, Alex Stamos, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17640852/facebook-cso-alex-stamos-departing-no-replacement">was not replaced</a> when he left in 2018, which may indicate that having an advocate for security on the leadership team led to debate and disagreement. Retaining a voice for security and privacy issues at the executive level, before those issues affected users, was a good thing. Now that responsibility is diffuse. It's unclear how Facebook measures and assesses its own progress and who might be held accountable for failings. Facebook can begin the process of fixing this by designating a senior executive who is responsible for trust.</p>

<p><i>Engage with regulators.</i> Much of Facebook's posturing seems to be an attempt to forestall regulation. Facebook sends lobbyists to Washington and other capitals, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/21/facebook-to-drop-on-site-support-for-political-campaigns.html">until recently</a> the company sent support staff to politician's offices. It has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment">secret lobbying campaigns against privacy laws</a>. And Facebook has <a href="https://epic.org/enforce-the-order/">repeatedly violated</a> a 2011 Federal Trade Commission consent order regarding user privacy. Regulating big technical projects is not easy. Most of the people who understand how these systems work understand them because they build them. Societies will regulate Facebook, and the quality of that regulation requires real education of legislators and their staffs. While businesses often want to avoid regulation, any focus on privacy will require strong government oversight. If Facebook is serious about privacy being a real interest, it will accept both government regulation and community input.</p>

<p>User privacy is traditionally against Facebook's core business interests. Advertising is its business model, and targeted ads sell better and more profitably -- and that requires users to engage with the platform as much as possible. Increased pressure on Facebook to manage propaganda and hate speech could easily lead to more surveillance. But there is pressure in the other direction as well, as users equate privacy with increased control over how they present themselves on the platform.</p>

<p>We don't expect Facebook to abandon its advertising business model, relent in its push for monopolistic dominance, or fundamentally alter its social networking platforms. But the company can give users important privacy protections and controls without abandoning <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/">surveillance capitalism</a>. While some of these changes will reduce profits in the short term, we hope Facebook's leadership realizes that they are in the best long-term interest of the company.</p>

<p>Facebook talks about community and bringing people together. These are admirable goals, and there's plenty of value (and profit) in having a sustainable platform for connecting people. But as long as the most important measure of success is short-term profit, doing things that help strengthen communities will fall by the wayside. Surveillance, which allows individually targeted advertising, will be prioritized over user privacy. Outrage, which drives engagement, will be prioritized over feelings of belonging. And corporate secrecy, which allows Facebook to evade both regulators and its users, will be prioritized over societal oversight. If Facebook now truly believes that these latter options are critical to its long-term success as a company, we welcome the changes that are forthcoming.</p>

	    <p>The Crypto Wars have been waging off-and-on for a quarter-century. On one side is law enforcement, which wants to be able to break encryption, to access devices and communications of terrorists and criminals. On the other are almost every cryptographer and computer security expert, repeatedly explaining that there's no way to provide this capability without also weakening the security of every user of those devices and communications systems.</p>

<p>It's an impassioned debate, acrimonious at times, but there are real technologies that can be brought to bear on the problem: key-escrow technologies, code obfuscation technologies, and backdoors with different properties. Pervasive surveillance capitalism -- Â­as practiced by the Internet companies that are already spying on everyoneÂ­ -- matters. So does society's underlying security needs. There is a security benefit to giving access to law enforcement, even though it would inevitably and invariably also give that access to others. However, there is also a security benefit of having these systems protected from all attackers, including law enforcement. These benefits are mutually exclusive. Which is more important, and to what degree?</p>

<p>The problem is that almost no policymakers are discussing this policy issue from a technologically informed perspective, and very few technologists truly understand the policy contours of the debate. The result is both sides consistently talking past each other, and policy proposals -- Â­that occasionally become lawÂ­ -- that are technological disasters.</p>

<p>This isn't sustainable, either for this issue or any of the other policy issues surrounding Internet security. We need policymakers who understand technology, but we also need cybersecurity technologists who understandÂ­ -- and are involved in -- Â­policy. We need public-interest technologists.</p>

<p>Let's pause at that term. The Ford Foundation defines public-interest technologists as "technology practitioners who focus on social justice, the common good, and/or the public interest." A group of academics recently wrote that public-interest technologists are people who "study the application of technology expertise to advance the public interest, generate public benefits, or promote the public good." Tim Berners-Lee has called them "philosophical engineers." I think of public-interest technologists as people who combine their technological expertise with a public-interest focus: by working on tech policy, by working on a tech project with a public benefit, or by working as a traditional technologist for an organization with a public benefit. Maybe it's not the best termÂ­ -- and I know not everyone likes itÂ­ -- but it's a decent umbrella term that can encompass all these roles.</p>

<p>We need public-interest technologists in policy discussions. We need them on congressional staff, in federal agencies, at non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in academia, inside companies, and as part of the press. In our field, we need them to get involved in not only the Crypto Wars, but everywhere cybersecurity and policy touch each other: the vulnerability equities debate, election security, cryptocurrency policy, Internet of Things safety and security, big data, algorithmic fairness, adversarial machine learning, critical infrastructure, and national security. When you broaden the definition of Internet security, many additional areas fall within the intersection of cybersecurity and policy. Our particular expertise and way of looking at the world is critical for understanding a great many technological issues, such as net neutrality and the regulation of critical infrastructure. I wouldn't want to formulate public policy about artificial intelligence and robotics without a security technologist involved.</p>

<p>Public-interest technology isn't new. Many organizations are working in this area, from older organizations like EFF and EPIC to newer ones like Verified Voting and Access Now. Many academic classes and programs combine technology and public policy. My cybersecurity policy class at the Harvard Kennedy School is just one example. Media startups like The Markup are doing technology-driven journalism. There are even programs and initiatives related to public-interest technology inside for-profit corporations.</p>

<p>This might all seem like a lot, but it's really not. There aren't enough people doing it, there aren't enough people who know it needs to be done, and there aren't enough places to do it. We need to build a world where there is a viable career path for public-interest technologists.</p>

<p>There are many barriers. There's a report titled A Pivotal Moment that includes this quote: "While we cite individual instances of visionary leadership and successful deployment of technology skill for the public interest, there was a consensus that a stubborn cycle of inadequate supply, misarticulated demand, and an inefficient marketplace stymie progress."</p>

<p>That quote speaks to the three places for intervention. One: the supply side. There just isn't enough talent to meet the eventual demand. This is especially acute in cybersecurity, which has a talent problem across the field. Public-interest technologists are a diverse and multidisciplinary group of people. Their backgrounds come from technology, policy, and law. We also need to foster diversity within public-interest technology; the populations using the technology must be represented in the groups that shape the technology. We need a variety of ways for people to engage in this sphere: ways people can do it on the side, for a couple of years between more traditional technology jobs, or as a full-time rewarding career. We need public-interest technology to be part of every core computer-science curriculum, with "clinics" at universities where students can get a taste of public-interest work. We need technology companies to give people sabbaticals to do this work, and then value what they've learned and done.</p>

<p>Two: the demand side. This is our biggest problem right now; not enough organizations understand that they need technologists doing public-interest work. We need jobs to be funded across a wide variety of NGOs. We need staff positions throughout the government: executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. President Obama's US Digital Service should be expanded and replicated; so should Code for America. We need more press organizations that perform this kind of work.</p>

<p>Three: the marketplace. We need job boards, conferences, and skills exchangesÂ­ -- places where people on the supply side can learn about the demand.</p>

<p>Major foundations are starting to provide funding in this space: the Ford and MacArthur Foundations in particular, but others as well.</p>

<p>This problem in our field has an interesting parallel with the field of public-interest law. In the 1960s, there was no such thing as public-interest law. The field was deliberately created, funded by organizations like the Ford Foundation. They financed legal aid clinics at universities, so students could learn housing, discrimination, or immigration law. They funded fellowships at organizations like the ACLU and the NAACP. They created a world where public-interest law is valued, where all the partners at major law firms are expected to have done some public-interest work. Today, when the ACLU advertises for a staff attorney, paying one-third to one-tenth normal salary, it gets hundreds of applicants. Today, 20% of Harvard Law School graduates go into public-interest law, and the school has soul-searching seminars because that percentage is so low. Meanwhile, the percentage of computer-science graduates going into public-interest work is basically zero.</p>

<p>This is bigger than computer security. Technology now permeates society in a way it didn't just a couple of decades ago, and governments move too slowly to take this into account. That means technologists now are relevant to all sorts of areas that they had no traditional connection to: climate change, food safety, future of work, public health, bioengineering.</p>

<p>More generally, technologists need to understand the policy ramifications of their work. There's a pervasive myth in Silicon Valley that technology is politically neutral. It's not, and I hope most people reading this today knows that. We built a world where programmers felt they had an inherent right to code the world as they saw fit. We were allowed to do this because, until recently, it didn't matter. Now, too many issues are being decided in an unregulated capitalist environment where significant social costs are too often not taken into account.</p>

<p>This is where the core issues of society lie. The defining political question of the 20th century was: "What should be governed by the state, and what should be governed by the market?" This defined the difference between East and West, and the difference between political parties within countries. The defining political question of the first half of the 21st century is: "How much of our lives should be governed by technology, and under what terms?" In the last century, economists drove public policy. In this century, it will be technologists.</p>

<p>The future is coming faster than our current set of policy tools can deal with. The only way to fix this is to develop a new set of policy tools with the help of technologists. We need to be in all aspects of public-interest work, from informing policy to creating tools all building the future. The world needs all of our help.</p>

	    <p>In his 2008 <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">white paper</a> that first proposed <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a>, the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto concluded with: "We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust." He was referring to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-blockchain/">blockchain</a>, the system behind bitcoin cryptocurrency. The circumvention of trust is a great promise, but it's just not true. Yes, bitcoin eliminates certain trusted intermediaries that are inherent in other payment systems like credit cards. But you still have to trust bitcoin -- and everything about it.</p>

<p>Much has been written about <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchains</a> and how they displace, reshape, or eliminate trust. But when you analyze both blockchain and trust, you quickly realize that there is much more hype than value. Blockchain solutions are often much worse than what they replace.</p>

<p>First, a caveat. By blockchain, I mean something very specific: the data structures and protocols that make up a <em>public</em> blockchain. These have three essential elements. The first is a distributed (as in multiple copies) but centralized (as in there's only one) ledger, which is a way of recording what happened and in what order. This ledger is public, meaning that anyone can read it, and immutable, meaning that no one can change what happened in the past.</p>

<p>The second element is the consensus algorithm, which is a way to ensure all the copies of the ledger are the same. This is generally called mining; a critical part of the system is that anyone can participate. It is also distributed, meaning that you don't have to trust any particular node in the consensus network. It can also be extremely expensive, both in data storage and in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-mining-guzzles-energyand-its-carbon-footprint-just-keeps-growing/">energy required</a> to maintain it. Bitcoin has the most expensive consensus algorithm the world has ever seen, by far.</p>

<p>Finally, the third element is the currency. This is some sort of digital token that has value and is publicly traded. Currency is a necessary element of a blockchain to align the incentives of everyone involved. Transactions involving these tokens are stored on the ledger.</p>

<p>Private blockchains are completely uninteresting. (By this, I mean systems that use the blockchain data structure but don't have the above three elements.) In general, they have some external limitation on who can interact with the blockchain and its features. These are not anything new; they're distributed append-only data structures with a list of individuals authorized to add to it. Consensus protocols have been studied in distributed systems for more than 60 years. Append-only data structures have been similarly well covered. They're blockchains in name only, and -- as far as I can tell -- the only reason to operate one is to ride on the blockchain hype.</p>

<p>All three elements of a public blockchain fit together as a single network that offers new security properties. The question is: Is it actually good for anything? It's all a matter of trust.</p>

<p>Trust is essential to society. As a species, humans are wired to trust one another. Society can't function without trust, and the fact that we mostly don't even think about it is a measure of how well trust works.</p>

<p>The word "trust" is loaded with many meanings. There's personal and intimate trust. When we say we trust a friend, we mean that we trust their intentions and know that those intentions will inform their actions. There's also the less intimate, less personal trust -- we might not know someone personally, or know their motivations, but we can trust their future actions. Blockchain enables this sort of trust: We don't know any bitcoin miners, for example, but we trust that they will follow the mining protocol and make the whole system work.</p>

<p>Most blockchain enthusiasts have a unnaturally narrow definition of trust. They're fond of catchphrases like "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/opinion/bitcoin-boom-technology-trust.html">in code we trust</a>," "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Math-We-Trust-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B07C7TPXMD?tag=w050b-20">in math we trust</a>," and "<a href="https://cryptoclothing.org/product/crypto-shirt/">in crypto we trust</a>." This is trust as verification. But verification isn't the same as trust.</p>

<p>In 2012, I wrote a book about trust and security, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/liars_and_outliers/"><em>Liars and Outliers</em></a>. In it, I listed four very general systems our species uses to incentivize trustworthy behavior. The first two are morals and reputation. The problem is that they scale only to a certain population size. Primitive systems were good enough for small communities, but larger communities required delegation, and more formalism.</p>

<p>The third is institutions. Institutions have rules and laws that induce people to behave according to the group norm, imposing sanctions on those who do not. In a sense, laws formalize reputation. Finally, the fourth is security systems. These are the wide varieties of security technologies we employ: door locks and tall fences, alarm systems and guards, forensics and audit systems, and so on.</p>

<p>These four elements work together to enable trust. Take banking, for example. Financial institutions, merchants, and individuals are all concerned with their reputations, which prevents theft and fraud. The laws and regulations surrounding every aspect of banking keep everyone in line, including backstops that limit risks in the case of fraud. And there are lots of security systems in place, from anti-counterfeiting technologies to internet-security technologies.</p>

<p>In his 2018 book, <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/blockchain-and-new-architecture-trust">Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust</a></em>, Kevin Werbach outlines four different "trust architectures." The first is peer-to-peer trust. This basically corresponds to my morals and reputational systems: pairs of people who come to trust each other. His second is leviathan trust, which corresponds to institutional trust. You can see this working in our system of contracts, which allows parties that don't trust each other to enter into an agreement because they both trust that a government system will help resolve disputes. His third is intermediary trust. A good example is the credit card system, which allows untrusting buyers and sellers to engage in commerce. His fourth trust architecture is distributed trust. This is emergent trust in the particular security system that is blockchain.</p>

<p>What blockchain does is <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/who-controls-the-blockchain">shift some of the trust</a> in people and institutions to trust in technology. You need to trust the cryptography, the protocols, the software, the computers and the network. And you need to trust them absolutely, because they're often single points of failure.</p>

<p>When that trust turns out to be misplaced, there is no recourse. If your bitcoin exchange <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">gets hacked</a>, you lose all of your money. If your bitcoin wallet <a href="https://www.ccn.com/breaking-numerous-bitcoin-wallets-may-have-been-compromised-by-rogue-developer">gets hacked</a>, you lose all of your money. If you forget your login credentials, you lose all of your money. If there's a <a href="https://medium.com/new-alchemy/a-short-history-of-smart-contract-hacks-on-ethereum-1a30020b5fd">bug in the code</a> of your smart contract, you lose all of your money. If someone successfully <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/01/08/ethereum-classic-blockchain-su.html">hacks the blockchain security</a>, you lose all of your money. In many ways, trusting technology is harder than trusting people. Would you rather trust a human legal system or the details of some computer code you don't have the expertise to audit?</p>

<p>Blockchain enthusiasts point to more traditional forms of trust -- bank processing fees, for example -- as expensive. But blockchain trust is also costly; <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3074070">the cost is just hidden</a>. For bitcoin, that's the cost of the additional bitcoin mined, the transaction fees, and the enormous environmental waste.</p>

<p>Blockchain doesn't eliminate the need to trust human institutions. There will always be a big gap that can't be addressed by technology alone. People still need to be in charge, and there is always a need for governance outside the system. This is obvious in the ongoing debate about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/22/money-and-politics-bitcoins-governance-crisis/">changing the bitcoin block size</a>, or in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-executes-blockchain-hard-fork-return-dao-investor-funds">fixing the DAO attack</a> against <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/trust-the-inside-story-of-the-rise-and-fall-of-ethereum">Ethereum</a>. There's always a need to override the rules, and there's always a need for the ability to make permanent rules changes. As long as hard forks are a possibility -- that's when the people in charge of a blockchain step outside the system to change it -- people will need to be in charge.</p>

<p>Any blockchain system will have to coexist with other, more conventional systems. Modern banking, for example, is designed to be reversible. Bitcoin is not. That makes it hard to make the two compatible, and the result is often an insecurity. Steve Wozniak was <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/steve-wozniak-had-70000-in-bitcoin-stolen-after-falling-for-a-simple-yet-perfect-scam-2018-02-28">scammed out of $70K</a> in bitcoin because he forgot this.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is often centralized. Bitcoin might theoretically be based on distributed trust, but in practice, that's just not true. Just about everyone using bitcoin has to trust one of the few available wallets and use one of the few available exchanges. People have to trust the software and the operating systems and the computers everything is running on. And we've seen attacks against wallets and exchanges. We've seen Trojans and phishing and password guessing. Criminals have even used flaws in the system that people use to repair their cell phones to steal bitcoin.</p>

<p>Moreover, in any distributed trust system, there are backdoor methods for centralization to creep back in. With bitcoin, there are only a few miners of consequence. There's one company that provides most of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/crypto-mining-giant-bitmain-on-target-for-10b-revenue-this-year/">mining hardware</a>. There are only a few dominant exchanges. To the extent that most people interact with bitcoin, it is through these centralized systems. This also allows for attacks against blockchain-based systems.</p>

<p>These issues are not bugs in current blockchain applications, they're inherent in how blockchain works. Any evaluation of the security of the system has to take the whole socio-technical system into account. Too many blockchain enthusiasts focus on the technology and ignore the rest.</p>

<p>To the extent that people don't use bitcoin, it's because they don't trust bitcoin. That has nothing to do with the cryptography or the protocols. In fact, a system where you can lose your life savings if you forget your key or download a piece of malware is not particularly trustworthy. No amount of explaining how SHA-256 works to prevent <a href="https://medium.com/innerquest-online/how-does-a-blockchain-prevent-double-spending-of-bitcoins-fa0ecf9849f7">double-spending</a> will fix that.</p>

<p>Similarly, to the extent that people do use blockchains, it is because they trust them. People either own bitcoin or not based on reputation; that's true even for speculators who own bitcoin simply because they think it will make them rich quickly. People choose a wallet for their cryptocurrency, and an exchange for their transactions, based on reputation. We even evaluate and trust the cryptography that underpins blockchains based on the algorithms' reputation.</p>

<p>To see how this can fail, look at the various <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/following-a-tuna-from-fiji-to-brooklynon-the-blockchain/">supply-chain security systems</a> that are using blockchain. A blockchain isn't a necessary feature of any of them. The reasons they're successful is that everyone has a single software platform to enter their data in. Even though the blockchain systems are built on distributed trust, people don't necessarily accept that. For example, some companies <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ibm-blockchain-maersk-shipping-struggling">don't trust the IBM/Maersk system</a> because it's not <em>their</em> blockchain.</p>

<p>Irrational? Maybe, but that's how trust works. It can't be replaced by algorithms and protocols. It's much more social than that.</p>

<p>Still, the idea that blockchains can somehow eliminate the need for trust persists. Recently, I received an email from a company that implemented secure messaging using blockchain. It said, in part: "Using the blockchain, as we have done, has eliminated the need for Trust." This sentiment suggests the writer misunderstands both what blockchain does and how trust works.</p>

<p>Do you need a public blockchain? The answer is almost certainly <a href="https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec">no</a>. A blockchain probably doesn't solve the security problems you think it solves. The security problems it solves are probably not the ones you have. (Manipulating audit data is probably not your major security risk.) A false trust in blockchain can itself be a security risk. The inefficiencies, especially in scaling, are probably not worth it. I have looked at many blockchain <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/blockchain-applications">applications</a>, and all of them could achieve the same security properties without using a blockchainÂ­ -- of course, then they wouldn't have the cool name.</p>

<p>Honestly, cryptocurrencies are useless. They're only used by speculators looking for quick riches, people who don't like government-backed currencies, and criminals who want a black-market way to exchange money.</p>

<p>To answer the question of whether the blockchain is needed, ask yourself: Does the blockchain change the system of trust in any meaningful way, or just shift it around? Does it just try to replace trust with verification? Does it strengthen existing trust relationships, or try to go against them? How can trust be abused in the new system, and is this better or worse than the potential abuses in the old system? And lastly: What would your system look like if you didn't use blockchain at all?</p>

<p>If you ask yourself those questions, it's likely you'll choose solutions that don't use public blockchain. And that'll be a good thing -- especially when the hype dissipates.</p>

	    <p>Our work in cybersecurity is inexorably intertwined with public policy andÂ­ -- more generallyÂ­ -- the public interest. It's obvious in the debates on encryption and vulnerability disclosure, but it's also part of the policy discussions about the Internet of Things, cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, social media platforms, and pretty much everything else related to IT.</p>

<p>This societal dimension to our traditionally technical area is bringing with it a need for public-interest technologists.</p>

<p>Defining this term is difficult. One <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/equals-change-blog/posts/5-reasons-you-might-be-a-public-interest-technologist/">blog post</a> described public-interest technologists as "technology practitioners who focus on social justice, the common good, and/or the public interest." A group of academics in this field wrote that "public-interest technology refers to the study and application of technology expertise to advance the public interest/generate public benefits/promote the public good."</p>

<p>I think of public-interest technologists as people who combine their technological expertise with a public-interest focus, either by working on tech policy (for the EFF or as a congressional staffer, as examples), working on a technology project with a public benefit (such as Tor or Signal), or working as a more traditional technologist for an organization with a public-interest focus (providing IT security for Human Rights Watch, as an example). Public-interest technology isn't one thing; it's many things. And not everyone likes the term. Maybe it's not the most accurate term for what different people do, but it's the best umbrella term that covers everyone.</p>

<p>It's a growing field -- one far broader than cybersecurity -- and one that I am increasingly focusing my time on. I maintain a <a href="https://public-interest-tech.com/">resources page</a> for public-interest technology. (<a href="https://www.netgainpartnership.org/resources/2018/1/26/a-pivotal-moment">This</a> is the single best document to read about the current state of public-interest technology, and what is still to be done.)</p>

<p>This year, <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/press/97/rsa-conference-and-bruce-schneier-to-host-first">I am bringing some of these ideas to the RSA Conference</a>. In <a href="/blogs/why-ford-foundation-is-helping-bruce-schneier-bring-a-new-field-to-rsa-conference-in-2019">partnership </a> with the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/campaigns/public-interest-tech/">Ford Foundation</a>, I am hosting a mini-track on public-interest technology. Six sessions throughout the day on Thursday will highlight different aspects of this important work. We'll look at public-interest technologists inside governments, as part of civil society, at universities, and in corporate environments.</p>

<ol><li><strong>How Public-Interest Technologists are Changing the World </strong>. This introductory panel lays the groundwork for the day to come. I'll be joined on stage with Matt Mitchell of Tactical Tech, and we'll discuss how public-interest technologists are already changing the world.</li>

<p><li><strong>Public-Interest Tech in Silicon Valley</strong>. Most of us work for technology companies, and this panel discusses public-interest technology work within companies. Mitchell Baker of Mozilla Corp. and Cindy Cohn of the EFF will lead the discussion, looking at both public-interest projects within corporations and employee activism initiatives by corporate employees.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Working in Civil Society.</strong> Bringing a technological perspective into civil society can transform how organizations do their work. Through a series of lightning talks, this session examines how this transformation can happen from a variety of perspectives: exposing government surveillance, protecting journalists worldwide, preserving a free and open Internet, bringing a security focus to artificial intelligence research, protecting NGO networks, and more. For those of us in security, bringing tech tools to those who need them is core to what we do.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Government Needs You.</strong> Government needs technologists at all levels. We're needed on legislative staffs and at regulatory agencies in order to make effective tech policy, but we're also needed elsewhere to implement policy more broadly. We're needed to advise courts, testify at hearings, and serve on advisory committees. At this session, you'll hear from public-interest technologists who have had a major impact on government from a variety of positions, and learn about ways you can get involved.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Changing Academia.</strong> Higher education needs to incorporate a public-interest perspective in technology departments, and a technology perspective in public-policy departments. This could look like ethics courses for computer science majors, programming for law students, or joint degrees that combine technology and social science. Danny Weitzner of MIT and Latanya Sweeney of Harvard will discuss efforts to build these sorts of interdisciplinary classes, programs, and institutes.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>The Future of Public-Interest Tech</strong> Creating an environment where public-interest technology can flourish will require a robust pipeline: more people wanting to go into this field, more places for them to go, and an improved market that matches supply with demand. In this closing session, Jenny Toomey of the Ford Foundation and I will sum up the day and discuss future directions for growing the field, funding trajectories, highlighting outstanding needs and gaps, and describing how you can get involved.</li></ol></p>

<p>Check <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19/agenda/bridging-the-gap-cybersecurity-public-interest-tech">here</a> for times and locations, and be sure to reserve your seat.</p>

<p>We all need to help. I don't mean that we all need to quit our jobs and go work on legislative staffs; there's a lot we can do while still maintaining our existing careers. We can advise governments and other public-interest organizations. We can agitate for the public interest inside the corporations we work for. We can speak at conferences and write opinion pieces for publication. We can teach part-time at all levels. But some of us will need to do this full-time.</p>

<p>There's an <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/building-a-new-field-of-public-interest-technology-lessons-learned-from-public-interest-law/">interesting parallel</a> to public-interest law, which covers everything from human-rights lawyers to public defenders. In the 1960s, that field didn't exist. The field was deliberately created, funded by organizations like the Ford Foundation. They created a world where public-interest law is valued. Today, when the ACLU advertises for a staff attorney, paying a third to a tenth of a normal salary, it gets hundreds of applicants. Today, 20% of Harvard Law School grads go into public-interest law, while the percentage of computer science grads doing public-interest work is basically zero. This is what we need to fix.</p>

<p>Please stop in at my mini-track. Come for a panel that interests you, or stay for the whole day. Bring your ideas. Find me to talk about this further. Pretty much all the major policy debates of this century will have a strong technological component -- and an important cybersecurity angle -- and we all need to get involved.</p>

	    <p>The so-called Crypto Wars have been going on <a href="https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3407-doomed-to-repeat-history-lessons-from-the-crypto-wars-of-the-1990s/Crypto%20Wars_ReDo.7cb491837ac541709797bdf868d37f52.pdf">for 25 years</a> now. Basically, the FBI -- and some of their peer agencies in the UK, Australia, and elsewhere -- <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">argue</a> that the pervasive use of civilian encryption is hampering their ability to solve crimes and that they need the tech companies to make their systems susceptible to government eavesdropping. Sometimes their complaint is about communications systems, like voice or messaging apps. Sometimes it's about end-user devices. On the other side of this debate is pretty much all technologists working in computer security and cryptography, who <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">argue</a> that adding eavesdropping features fundamentally makes those systems less secure.</p>

<p>A recent entry in this debate is a <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">proposal</a> by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson, both from the UK's GCHQ (the British signals-intelligence agency -- basically, its NSA). It's actually a positive contribution to the discourse around backdoors; most of the time government officials broadly demand that the tech companies <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rod-rosenstein-encryption-backdoor/">figure out a way</a> to meet their requirements, without providing any details. Levy and Robinson write:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a world of encrypted services, a potential solution could be to go back a few decades. It's relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call. The service provider usually controls the identity system and so really decides who's who and which devices are involved -- they're usually involved in introducing the parties to a chat or call. You end up with everything still being end-to-end encrypted, but there's an extra 'end' on this particular communication. This sort of solution seems to be no more intrusive than the virtual crocodile clips that our democratically elected representatives and judiciary authorise today in traditional voice intercept solutions and certainly doesn't give any government power they shouldn't have.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the surface, this isn't a big ask. It doesn't affect the encryption that protects the communications. It only affects the authentication that assures people of whom they are talking to. But it's no less dangerous a backdoor than any others that have been proposed: It exploits a security vulnerability rather than fixing it, and it opens all users of the system to exploitation of that same vulnerability by others.</p>

<p>In a blog post, cryptographer Matthew Green <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">summarized</a> the technical problems with this GCHQ proposal. Basically, making this backdoor work requires not only changing the cloud computers that oversee communications, but it also means changing the client program on everyone's phone and computer. And that change makes all of those systems less secure. Levy and Robinson make a big deal of the fact that their backdoor would only be targeted against specific individuals and their communications, but it's still a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/62114/give-ghost-backdoor/">general backdoor</a> that <em>could</em> be used against anybody.</p>

<p>The basic problem is that a backdoor is a technical capability -- a vulnerability -- that is available to anyone who knows about it and has access to it. Surrounding that vulnerability is a procedural system that tries to limit access to that capability. Computers, especially internet-connected computers, are inherently hackable, limiting the effectiveness of any procedures. The best defense is to not have the vulnerability at all.</p>

<p>That old physical eavesdropping system Levy and Robinson allude to also exploits a security vulnerability. Because telephone conversations were unencrypted as they passed through the physical wires of the phone system, the police were able to go to a switch in a phone company facility or a junction box on the street and manually attach alligator clips to a specific pair and listen in to what that phone transmitted and received. It was a vulnerability that anyone could exploit -- not just the police -- but was mitigated by the fact that the phone company was a monolithic monopoly, and physical access to the wires was either difficult (inside a phone company building) or obvious (on the street at a junction box).</p>

<p>The functional equivalent of physical eavesdropping for modern computer phone switches is a requirement of a 1994 U.S. law called CALEA -- and similar laws in other countries. By law, telephone companies must engineer phone switches that the government can eavesdrop, mirroring that old physical system with computers. It is not the same thing, though. It doesn't have those same physical limitations that make it more secure. It can be administered remotely. And it's implemented by a computer, which makes it vulnerable to the same hacking that every other computer is vulnerable to.</p>

<p>This isn't a theoretical problem; these systems have been subverted. The most <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair">public incident</a> dates from 2004 in Greece. Vodafone Greece had phone switches with the eavesdropping feature mandated by CALEA. It was turned off by default in the Greek phone system, but the NSA managed to surreptitiously <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/">turn it on</a> and use it to eavesdrop on the Greek prime minister and over 100 other high-ranking dignitaries.</p>

<p>There's nothing distinct about a phone switch that makes it any different from other modern encrypted voice or chat systems; any remotely administered backdoor system will be just as vulnerable. Imagine a chat program added this GCHQ backdoor. It would have to add a feature that added additional parties to a chat from somewhere in the system -- and not by the people at the endpoints. It would have to suppress any messages alerting users to another party being added to that chat. Since some chat programs, like iMessage and Signal, automatically send such messages, it would force those systems to lie to their users. Other systems would simply never implement the "tell me who is in this chat conversation" featureÂ­which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>And once that's in place, every government will try to hack it for its own purposesÂ­ -- just as the NSA hacked Vodafone Greece. Again, this is nothing new. In 2010, China successfully hacked the back-door mechanism Google <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/china-google-attack-part-widespread-spying-effort-28293/">put in place</a> to meet law-enforcement requests. In 2015, someone -- we don't know who -- <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232227-where-did-i-leave-my-keys/abstract">hacked an NSA backdoor</a> in a random-number generator used to create encryption keys, changing the parameters so they could also eavesdrop on the communications. There are certainly other stories that haven't been made public.</p>

<p>Simply adding the feature erodes public trust. If you were a dissident in a totalitarian country trying to communicate securely, would you want to use a voice or messaging system that is known to have this sort of backdoor? Who would you bet on, especially when the cost of losing the bet might be imprisonment or worse: the company that runs the system, or your country's government intelligence agency? If you were a senior government official, or the head of a large multinational corporation, or the security manager or a critical technician at a power plant, would you want to use this system?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Two years ago, there was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-design-feature-encrypted-messages">rumor</a> of a WhatsApp backdoor. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/flawed-reporting-about-whatsapp">details</a> are <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">complicated</a>, and calling it a backdoor or a vulnerability <a href="https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/">is</a> <a href="http://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687">largely</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5nq201/whatsapp_backdoor_allows_snooping_on_encrypted/dce86wa/?st=jpfg671x&amp;sh=482f0949">inaccurate</a> -- but the resultant confusion caused some people to abandon the encrypted messaging service.</p>

<p>Trust is fragile, and <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/pjcis-2018/">transparency</a> is essential to trust. And while Levy and Robinson state that "any exceptional access solution should not fundamentally change the trust relationship between a service provider and its users," this proposal does exactly that. Communications companies could no longer be honest about what their systems were doing, and we would have no reason to trust them if they tried.</p>

<p>In the end, all of these exceptional access mechanisms, whether they exploit existing vulnerabilities that should be closed or force vendors to open new ones, reduce the security of the underlying system. They reduce our reliance on security technologies we know how to do well -- cryptography -- to computer security technologies we are much less good at. Even worse, they replace technical security measures with organizational procedures. Whether it's a database of master keys that could decrypt an iPhone or a communications switch that orchestrates who is securely chatting with whom, it is vulnerable to attack. And it will be attacked.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion is a specific example of a broader discussion that we need to have, and it's about the attack/defense balance. Which should we prioritize? Should we design our systems to be open to attack, in which case they can be exploited by law enforcement -- and others? Or should we design our systems to be as secure as possible, which means they will be better protected from hackers, criminals, foreign governments and -- unavoidably -- law enforcement as well?</p>

<p>This discussion is larger than the FBI's ability to solve crimes or the NSA's ability to spy. We know that foreign intelligence services are targeting the communications of our elected officials, our power infrastructure, and our voting systems. Do we really want some foreign country penetrating our lawful-access backdoor in the same way the NSA penetrated Greece's?</p>

<p>I have long maintained that we need to adopt a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/AC_StrategyPapers_No8_Saving_Cyberspace_WEB.pdf">defense-dominant strategy</a>: We should prioritize our need for security over our need for surveillance. This is especially true in the new world of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">physically capable computers</a>. Yes, it will mean that law enforcement will have a harder time eavesdropping on communications and unlocking computing devices. But law enforcement has <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">other forensic techniques</a> to collect surveillance data in our highly networked world. We'd be much better off <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20160301/104573/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-LandauS-20160301.pdf">increasing law enforcement's technical ability</a> to investigate crimes in the <a href="https://cdt.org/blog/%E2%80%98going-dark%E2%80%99-versus-a-%E2%80%98golden-age-for-surveillance%E2%80%99/">modern digital world</a> than we would be to weaken security for everyone. The ability to surreptitiously add ghost users to a conversation is a vulnerability, and it's one that we would be better served by closing than exploiting.</p>

	    <p>No one doubts that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will transform cybersecurity. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611860/ai-for-cybersecurity-is-a-hot-new-thing-and-a-dangerous-gamble/">We</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/03/artificial_inte.html">just</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-machine-learning-cybersecurity/">don't</a> <a href="https://threatpost.com/artificial-intelligence-a-cybersecurity-tool-for-good-and-sometimes-bad/137831/">know</a> <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3295596/security/ai-in-cybersecurity-what-works-and-what-doesnt.html">how</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/10/15/how-big-of-a-role-will-ai-have-in-cyber-security-over-the-next-decade/#3161f8676d1c">or</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ai-can-help-stop-cyberattacks-1537322940">when</a>. While the literature generally focuses on the different uses of AI by attackers and defenders Â­ and the resultant arms race between the two Â­ I want to talk about software vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>All software contains bugs. The reason is basically economic: The market doesn't want to pay for quality software. With a few exceptions, such as the space shuttle, the market prioritizes fast and cheap over good. The result is that any large modern software package contains hundreds or thousands of bugs.</p>

<p>Some percentage of bugs are also vulnerabilities, and a percentage of those are <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/threat-actors-prey-on-drupalgeddon-vulnerability-to-mass-compromise-websites-and-underlying-servers/">exploitable vulnerabilities</a>, meaning an attacker who knows about them can attack the underlying system in some way. And some percentage of those are discovered and used. This is why your computer and smartphone software is constantly being patched; software vendors are fixing bugs that are also vulnerabilities that have been discovered and are being used.</p>

<p>Everything would be better if software vendors found and fixed all bugs during the design and development process, but, as I said, the market doesn't reward that kind of delay and expense. AI, and machine learning in particular, has the potential to forever change this trade-off.</p>

<p>The problem of finding software vulnerabilities seems well-suited for ML systems. Going through code line by line is just the sort of tedious problem that computers excel at, if we can only teach them what a vulnerability looks like. There are challenges with that, of course, but there is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04320.pdf">already</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04497">a</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3180453">healthy</a> <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5033718">amount</a> <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/02/ndss2018_03A-2_Li_paper.pdf">of</a> <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/5/1652/pdf">academic</a> <a href="https://dspace.ou.nl/bitstream/1820/9725/1/Kronjee%20J%20IM9906%20AF%20scriptie.pdf">literature</a> on the topic -- <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-machine-learning-can-be-used-to-write-more-secure-computer-programs">and</a> <a href="http://www.vdiscover.org/">research</a> <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2018-07-machine-software-vulnerabilities.html">is</a> <a href="https://sdtimes.com/deep-neural-networks/microsoft-uses-machine-learning-combat-security-vulnerabilities/">continuing</a>. There's every reason to expect ML systems to get better at this as time goes on, and some reason to expect them to eventually become very good at it.</p>

<p>Finding vulnerabilities can benefit both attackers and defenders, but it's not a fair fight. When an attacker's ML system finds a vulnerability in software, the attacker can use it to compromise systems. When a defender's ML system finds the same vulnerability, he or she can try to patch the system or program network defenses to watch for and block code that tries to exploit it.</p>

<p>But when the same system is in the hands of a software developer who uses it to find the vulnerability before the software is ever released, the developer fixes it so it can never be used in the first place. The ML system will probably be part of his or her software design tools and will automatically find and fix vulnerabilities while the code is still in development.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a decade or so into the future. We might say to each other, "Remember those years when software vulnerabilities were a thing, before ML vulnerability finders were built into every compiler and fixed them before the software was ever released? Wow, those were crazy years." Not only is this future possible, but I would bet on it.</p>

<p>Getting from here to there will be a dangerous ride, though. Those vulnerability finders will first be unleashed on existing software, giving attackers hundreds if not thousands of vulnerabilities to exploit in real-world attacks. Sure, defenders can use the same systems, but many of today's <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/as-iot-security-concerns-rise-are-solutions-keeping-up/">Internet of Things systems</a> have no engineering teams to write patches and no ability to download and install patches. The result will be hundreds of vulnerabilities that attackers can find and use.</p>

<p>But if we look far enough into the horizon, we can see a future where <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/application-security/appscan">software vulnerabilities</a> are a thing of the past. Then we'll just have to worry about whatever <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/mayhem-darpa-cyber-grand-challenge-dod-voltron/">new and more advanced</a> attack techniques those AI systems come up with.</p>

	    <p>On November 4, 2016, the hacker "Guccifer 2.0," a front for Russia's military intelligence service, <a href="https://guccifer2.wordpress.com/2016/11/04/info-from-inside-the-fec-the-democrats-may-rig-the-elections/">claimed</a> in a blogpost that the Democrats were likely to use vulnerabilities to hack the presidential elections. On November 9, 2018, President Donald Trump started tweeting about the senatorial elections in Florida and Arizona. Without any evidence whatsoever, he said that Democrats were trying to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1060938144336367616">steal the election</a> through "FRAUD."</p>

<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3015680">Cybersecurity experts</a> <a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/watts_webreadypdf.pdf">would say</a> that posts like Guccifer 2.0's are intended to undermine public confidence in voting: a cyber-attack against the US democratic system. Yet Donald Trump's actions are doing far more damage to democracy. So far, his tweets on the topic have been retweeted over 270,000 times, eroding confidence far more effectively than any foreign influence campaign.</p>

<p>We need new ideas to explain how public statements on the Internet can weaken American democracy. Cybersecurity today is not only about computer systems. It's also about the ways attackers can use computer systems to manipulate and undermine public expectations about democracy. Not only do we need to rethink attacks against democracy; we also need to rethink the attackers as well.</p>

<p>This is one key reason why we wrote a <a href="http://henryfarrell.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SSRN-id3273111.pdf">new research paper</a> which uses ideas from computer security to understand the relationship between democracy and information. These ideas help us understand attacks which destabilize confidence in democratic institutions or debate.</p>

<p>Our research implies that insider attacks from within American politics can be more pernicious than attacks from other countries. They are more sophisticated, employ tools that are harder to defend against, and lead to harsh political tradeoffs. The US can threaten charges or impose sanctions when Russian trolling agencies attack its democratic system. But what punishments can it use when the attacker is the US president?</p>

<p>People who think about cybersecurity build on ideas about confrontations between states during the Cold War. Intellectuals such as Thomas Schelling developed deterrence theory, which explained how the US and USSR could maneuver to limit each other's options without ever actually going to war. Deterrence theory, and related concepts about the relative ease of attack and defense, seemed to explain the tradeoffs that the US and rival states faced, as they started to use cyber techniques to probe and compromise each others' information networks.</p>

<p>However, these ideas fail to acknowledge one key differences between the Cold War and today. Nearly all states -- whether democratic or authoritarian -- are entangled on the Internet. This creates both new tensions and new opportunities. The US assumed that the internet would help spread American liberal values, and that this was a good and uncontroversial thing. Illiberal states like Russia and China feared that Internet freedom was a direct threat to their own systems of rule. Opponents of the regime might use social media and online communication to coordinate among themselves, and appeal to the broader public, perhaps toppling their governments, as happened in Tunisia during the Arab Spring.</p>

<p>This led illiberal states to develop new domestic defenses against open information flows. As scholars like <a href="http://www.margaretroberts.net/">Molly Roberts</a> have shown, states like China and Russia discovered how they could &quot;flood&quot; internet discussion with online nonsense and distraction, making it impossible for their opponents to talk to each other, or even to distinguish between truth and falsehood. These flooding techniques stabilized authoritarian regimes, because they demoralized and confused the regime's opponents. Libertarians often argue that the best antidote to bad speech is more speech. What Vladimir Putin discovered was that the best antidote to more speech was bad speech.</p>

<p>Russia saw the Arab Spring and efforts to encourage democracy in its neighborhood as direct threats, and began experimenting with counter-offensive techniques. When a Russia-friendly government in Ukraine collapsed due to popular protests, Russia tried to destabilize new, democratic elections by hacking the system through which the election results would be announced. The <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2852461">clear intention</a> was to discredit the election results by announcing fake voting numbers that would throw public discussion into disarray.</p>

<p>This attack on public confidence in election results was thwarted at the last moment. Even so, it provided the model for a new kind of attack. Hackers don't have to secretly alter people's votes to affect elections. All they need to do is to damage public confidence that the votes were counted fairly. As researchers <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2852461">have argued</a>, "simply put, the attacker might not care who wins; the losing side believing that the election was stolen from them may be equally, if not more, valuable."</p>

<p>These two kinds of attacks -- "flooding" attacks aimed at destabilizing public discourse, and "confidence" attacks aimed at undermining public belief in elections -- were weaponized against the US in 2016. Russian social media trolls, hired by the "Internet Research Agency," flooded online political discussions with rumors and counter-rumors in order to create confusion and political division. Peter Pomerantsev <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-True-Everything-Possible-Surreal/dp/1610396006">describes</a> how in Russia, "one moment [Putin's media wizard] Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West." Similarly, Russian trolls tried to get Black Lives Matter protesters and anti-Black Lives Matter protesters to march at the same time and place, to create conflict and the appearance of chaos. Guccifer 2.0's blog post was surely intended to undermine confidence in the vote, preparing the ground for a wider destabilization campaign after Hillary Clinton won the election. Neither Putin nor anyone else anticipated that Trump would win, ushering in chaos on a vastly greater scale.</p>

<p>We do not know how successful these attacks were. A <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11084.html">new book</a> by John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck suggests that Russian efforts had no measurable long-term consequences. <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624">Detailed research</a> on the flow of news articles through social media by Yochai Benker, Robert Farris, and Hal Roberts agrees, showing that Fox News was far more influential in the spread of false news stories than any Russian effort.</p>

<p>However, global adversaries like the Russians aren't the only actors who can use flooding and confidence attacks. US actors can use just the same techniques. Indeed, they can arguably use them better, since they have a better understanding of US politics, more resources, and are far more difficult for the government to counter without raising First Amendment issues.</p>

<p>For example, when the Federal Communication Commission asked for comments on its proposal to get rid of "net neutrality," it was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/many-comments-critical-of-fiduciary-rule-are-fake-1514370601">flooded by fake comments</a> supporting the proposal. Nearly every <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/blogs/FilteringOutTheBotsUnique2017NetNeutralityComments.pdf">real person who commented</a> was in favor of net neutrality, but their arguments were drowned out by a flood of spurious comments purportedly made by identities stolen from porn sites, by people whose names and email addresses had been harvested without their permission, and, in some cases, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evg3xw/dead-people-are-posting-anti-net-neutrality-comments-to-the-fcc-website">from dead people</a>. This was done not just to generate fake support for the FCC's controversial proposal. It was to devalue public comments in general, making the general public's support for net neutrality politically irrelevant. FCC decision making on issues like net neutrality used to be dominated by industry insiders, and many would like to go back to the old regime.</p>

<p>Trump's efforts to undermine confidence in the Florida and Arizona votes work on a much larger scale. There are clear short-term benefits to asserting fraud where no fraud exists. This may sway judges or other public officials to make concessions to the Republicans to preserve their legitimacy. Yet they also destabilize American democracy in the long term. If Republicans are convinced that Democrats win by cheating, they will feel that their own manipulation of the system (by purging voter rolls, making voting more difficult and so on) are legitimate, and very probably cheat even more flagrantly in the future. This will trash collective institutions and leave everyone worse off.</p>

<p>It is notable that some Arizonan Republicans -- including Martha McSally -- have so far stayed firm against pressure from the White House and the Republican National Committee to claim that cheating is happening. They presumably see more long term value from preserving existing institutions than undermining them. Very plausibly, Donald Trump has exactly the opposite incentives. By weakening public confidence in the vote today, he makes it easier to claim fraud and perhaps plunge American politics into chaos if he is defeated in 2020.</p>

<p>If experts who see Russian flooding and confidence measures as cyberattacks on US democracy are right, then these attacks are just as dangerous -- and perhaps more dangerous -- when they are used by domestic actors. The risk is that over time they will destabilize American democracy so that it comes closer to Russia's managed democracy -- where nothing is real any more, and ordinary people feel a mixture of paranoia, helplessness and disgust when they think about politics. Paradoxically, Russian interference is far too ineffectual to get us there -- but domestically mounted attacks by all-American political actors might.</p>

<p>To protect against that possibility, we need to start thinking more systematically about the relationship between democracy and information. <a href="http://henryfarrell.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SSRN-id3273111.pdf">Our paper</a> provides one way to do this, highlighting the vulnerabilities of democracy against certain kinds of information attack. More generally, we need to build levees against flooding while shoring up public confidence in voting and other public information systems that are necessary to democracy.</p>

<p>The first may require radical changes in how we regulate social media companies. Modernization of government commenting platforms to make them robust against flooding is only a very minimal first step. Up until very recently, companies like Twitter have won market advantage from bot infestations -- even when it couldn't make a profit, it seemed that user numbers were growing. CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg have begun to worry about democracy, but their worries will likely only go so far. It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his business model depends on not understanding it. Sharp -- and legally enforceable -- limits on automated accounts are a first step. Radical redesign of networks and of trending indicators so that flooding attacks are less effective may be a second.</p>

<p>The second requires general standards for voting at the federal level, and a constitutional guarantee of the right to vote. Technical experts <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2018/04/american_elections_a.html">nearly universally favor</a> robust voting systems that would combine paper records with random post-election auditing, to prevent fraud and secure public confidence in voting. Other steps to ensure proper ballot design, and standardize vote counting and reporting will take more time and discussion -- yet the record of other countries show that they are not impossible.</p>

<p>The US is nearly unique among major democracies in the persistent flaws of its election machinery. Yet voting is not the only important form of democratic information. Apparent efforts to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/28/17168048/census-citizenship-2020-immigrants-count-trump-lawsuit">deliberately skew</a> the US census against counting undocumented immigrants show the need for a more general audit of the political information systems that we need if democracy is to function properly.</p>

<p>It's easier to respond to Russian hackers through sanctions, counter-attacks and the like than to domestic political attacks that undermine US democracy. To preserve the basic political freedoms of democracy requires recognizing that these freedoms are sometimes going to be abused by politicians such as Donald Trump. The best that we can do is to minimize the possibilities of abuse up to the point where they encroach on basic freedoms and harden the general institutions that secure democratic information against attacks intended to undermine them.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011854"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/11/how_surveillanc_1.html">How Surveillance Inhibits Freedom of Expression</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>In my book <cite>Data and Goliath</cite>, I write about the value of privacy. I talk about how it is essential for political liberty and justice, and for commercial fairness and equality. I talk about how it increases personal freedom and individual autonomy, and how the lack of it makes us all less secure. But this is probably the most important argument as to why society as a whole must protect privacy: it allows society to progress.</p>

<p>We know that surveillance has a chilling effect on freedom. People change their behavior when they live their lives under surveillance. They are less likely to speak freely and act individually. They self-censor. They become conformist. This is obviously true for government surveillance, but is true for corporate surveillance as well. We simply aren't as willing to be our individual selves when others are watching.</p>

<p>Let's take an example: hearing that parents and children are being separated as they cross the US border, you want to learn more. You visit the website of an international immigrants' rights group, a fact that is available to the government through mass Internet surveillance. You sign up for the group's mailing list, another fact that is potentially available to the government. The group then calls or e-mails to invite you to a local meeting. Same. Your license plates can be collected as you drive to the meeting; your face can be scanned and identified as you walk into and out of the meeting. If, instead of visiting the website, you visit the group's Facebook page, Facebook knows that you did and that feeds into its profile of you, available to advertisers and political activists alike. Ditto if you like their page, share a link with your friends, or just post about the issue.</p>

<p>Maybe you are an immigrant yourself, documented or not. Or maybe some of your family is. Or maybe you have friends or coworkers who are. How likely are you to get involved if you know that your interest and concern can be gathered and used by government and corporate actors? What if the issue you are interested in is pro- or anti-gun control, anti-police violence or in support of the police? Does that make a difference?</p>

<p>Maybe the issue doesn't matter, and you would never be afraid to be identified and tracked based on your political or social interests. But even if you are so fearless, you probably know someone who has more to lose, and thus more to fear, from their personal, sexual, or political beliefs being exposed.</p>

<p>This isn't just hypothetical. In the months and years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many of us censored what we spoke about on social media or what we searched on the Internet. We know from a 2013 PEN study that writers in the United States self-censored their browsing habits out of fear the government was watching. And this isn't exclusively an American event; Internet self-censorship is prevalent across the globe, China being a prime example.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this fear stagnates society in two ways. The first is that the presence of surveillance means society cannot experiment with new things without fear of reprisal, and that means those experimentsÂ­ -- if found to be inoffensive or even essential to society -- Â­cannot slowly become commonplace, moral, and then legal. If surveillance nips that process in the bud, change never happens. All social progressÂ­ -- from ending slavery to fighting for women's rightsÂ­ -- began as ideas that were, quite literally, dangerous to assert. Yet without the ability to safely develop, discuss, and eventually act on those assertions, our society would not have been able to further its democratic values in the way that it has.</p>

<p>Consider the decades-long fight for gay rights around the world. Within our lifetimes we have made enormous strides to combat homophobia and increase acceptance of queer folks' right to marry. Queer relationships slowly progressed from being viewed as immoral and illegal, to being viewed as somewhat moral and tolerated, to finally being accepted as moral and legal.</p>

<p>In the end, it was the public nature of those activities that eventually slayed the bigoted beast, but the ability to act in private was essential in the beginning for the early experimentation, community building, and organizing.</p>

<p>Marijuana legalization is going through the same process: it's currently sitting between somewhat moral, andÂ­ -- depending on the state or country in question -- Â­tolerated and legal. But, again, for this to have happened, someone decades ago had to try pot and realize that it wasn't really harmful, either to themselves or to those around them. Then it had to become a counterculture, and finally a social and political movement. If pervasive surveillance meant that those early pot smokers would have been arrested for doing something illegal, the movement would have been squashed before inception. Of course the story is more complicated than that, but the ability for members of society to privately smoke weed was essential for putting it on the path to legalization.</p>

<p>We don't yet know which subversive ideas and illegal acts of today will become political causes and positive social change tomorrow, but they're around. And they require privacy to germinate. Take away that privacy, and we'll have a much harder time breaking down our inherited moral assumptions.</p>

<p>The second way surveillance hurts our democratic values is that it encourages society to make more things illegal. Consider the things you doÂ­ -- the different things each of us doesÂ­ -- that portions of society find immoral. Not just recreational drugs and gay sex, but gambling, dancing, public displays of affection. All of us do things that are deemed immoral by some groups, but are not illegal because they don't harm anyone. But it's important that these things can be done out of the disapproving gaze of those who would otherwise rally against such practices.</p>

<p>If there is no privacy, there will be pressure to change. Some people will recognize that their morality isn't necessarily the morality of everyoneÂ­ -- and that that's okay. But others will start demanding legislative change, or using less legal and more violent means, to force others to match their idea of morality.</p>

<p>It's easy to imagine the more conservative (in the small-c sense, not in the sense of the named political party) among us getting enough power to make illegal what they would otherwise be forced to witness. In this way, privacy helps protect the rights of the minority from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>This is how we got Prohibition in the 1920s, and if we had had today's surveillance capabilities in the 1920s, it would have been far more effectively enforced. Recipes for making your own spirits would have been much harder to distribute. Speakeasies would have been impossible to keep secret. The criminal trade in illegal alcohol would also have been more effectively suppressed. There would have been less discussion about the harms of Prohibition, less "what if we didn't?" thinking. Political organizing might have been difficult. In that world, the law might have stuck to this day.</p>

<p>China serves as a cautionary tale. The country has long been a world leader in the ubiquitous surveillance of its citizens, with the goal not of crime prevention but of social control. They are about to further enhance their system, giving every citizen a "social credit" rating. The details are yet unclear, but the general concept is that people will be rated based on their activities, both online and off. Their political comments, their friends and associates, and everything else will be assessed and scored. Those who are conforming, obedient, and apolitical will be given high scores. People without those scores will be denied privileges like access to certain schools and foreign travel. If the program is half as far-reaching as early reports indicate, the subsequent pressure to conform will be enormous. This social surveillance system is precisely the sort of surveillance designed to maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>For social norms to change, people need to deviate from these inherited norms. People need the space to try alternate ways of living without risking arrest or social ostracization. People need to be able to read critiques of those norms without anyone's knowledge, discuss them without their opinions being recorded, and write about their experiences without their names attached to their words. People need to be able to do things that others find distasteful, or even immoral. The minority needs protection from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>Privacy makes all of this possible. Privacy encourages social progress by giving the few room to experiment free from the watchful eye of the many. Even if you are not personally chilled by ubiquitous surveillance, the society you live in is, and the personal costs are unequivocal.</p>

	    <p>Democracy is an information system.</p>

<p>That's the starting place of our new paper: "<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273111">Common-Knowledge Attacks on Democracy</a>." In it, we look at democracy through the lens of information security, trying to understand the current waves of Internet disinformation attacks. Specifically, we wanted to explain why the same disinformation campaigns that act as a stabilizing influence in Russia are destabilizing in the United States.</p>

<p>The answer revolves around the different ways autocracies and democracies work as information systems. We start by differentiating between two types of knowledge that societies use in their political systems. The first is <em>common political knowledge,</em> which is the body of information that people in a society broadly agree on. People agree on who the rulers are and what their claim to legitimacy is. People agree broadly on how their government works, even if they don't like it. In a democracy, people agree about how elections work: how districts are created and defined, how candidates are chosen, and that their votes countÂ­ -- even if only roughly and imperfectly.</p>

<p>We contrast this with a very different form of knowledge that we call <em>contested political knowledge,</em> which is, broadly, things that people in society disagree about. Examples are easy to bring to mind: how much of a role the government should play in the economy, what the tax rules should be, what sorts of regulations are beneficial and what sorts are harmful, and so on.</p>

<p>This seems basic, but it gets interesting when we contrast both of these forms of knowledge across autocracies and democracies. These two forms of government have incompatible needs for common and contested political knowledge.</p>

<p>For example, democracies draw upon the disagreements within their population to solve problems. Different political groups have different ideas of how to govern, and those groups vie for political influence by persuading voters. There is also long-term uncertainty about who will be in charge and able to set policy goals. Ideally, this is the mechanism through which a polity can harness the diversity of perspectives of its members to better solve complex policy problems. When no-one knows who is going to be in charge after the next election, different parties and candidates will vie to persuade voters of the benefits of different policy proposals.</p>

<p>But in order for this to work, there needs to be common knowledge both of how government functions and how political leaders are chosen. There also needs to be common knowledge of who the political actors are, what they and their parties stand for, and how they clash with each other. Furthermore, this knowledge is decentralized across a wide variety of actorsÂ­ -- an essential element, since ordinary citizens play a significant role in political decision making.</p>

<p>Contrast this with an autocracy. There, common political knowledge about who is in charge over the long term and what their policy goals are is a basic condition of stability. Autocracies do not require common political knowledge about the efficacy and fairness of elections, and strive to maintain a monopoly on other forms of common political knowledge. They actively suppress common political knowledge about potential groupings within their society, their levels of popular support, and how they might form coalitions with each other. On the other hand, they benefit from contested political knowledge about nongovernmental groups and actors in society. If no one really knows which other political parties might form, what they might stand for, and what support they might get, that itself is a significant barrier to those parties ever forming.</p>

<p>This difference has important consequences for security. Authoritarian regimes are vulnerable to information attacks that challenge their monopoly on common political knowledge. They are vulnerable to outside information that demonstrates that the government is manipulating common political knowledge to their own benefit. And they are vulnerable to attacks that turn contested political knowledgeÂ­ -- uncertainty about potential adversaries of the ruling regime, their popular levels of support and their ability to form coalitionsÂ­ -- into common political knowledge. As such, they are vulnerable to tools that allow people to communicate and organize more easily, as well as tools that provide citizens with outside information and perspectives.</p>

<p>For example, before the first stirrings of the Arab Spring, the Tunisian government had extensive control over common knowledge. It required everyone to publicly support the regime, making it hard for citizens to know how many other people hated it, and it prevented potential anti-regime coalitions from organizing. However, it didn't pay attention in time to Facebook, which allowed citizens to talk more easily about how much they detested their rulers, and, when an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-tunisia-act-of-one-fruit-vendor-sparks-wave-of-revolution-through-arab-world/2011/03/16/AFjfsueB_story.html?utm_term=.ce809ef69078">initial incident</a> sparked a protest, to rapidly organize mass demonstrations against the regime. The Arab Spring faltered in many countries, but it is no surprise that countries like Russia see the Internet openness agenda as a knife at their throats.</p>

<p>Democracies, in contrast, are vulnerable to information attacks that turn common political knowledge into contested political knowledge. If people disagree on the results of an election, or whether a census process is accurate, then democracy suffers. Similarly, if people lose any sense of what the other perspectives in society are, who is real and who is not real, then the debate and argument that democracy thrives on will be degraded. This is what seems to be Russia's aims in their information campaigns against the US: to weaken our collective trust in the institutions and systems that hold our country together. This is also the situation that writers like <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-paranoia-inducing-purpose-of-russian-hacks">Adrien Chen</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-True-Everything-Possible-Surreal/dp/1610396006">Peter Pomerantsev</a> describe in today's Russia, where no one knows which parties or voices are genuine, and which are puppets of the regime, creating general paranoia and despair.</p>

<p>This difference explains how the same policy measure can increase the stability of one form of regime and decrease the stability of the other. We have already seen that open information flows have benefited democracies while at the same time threatening autocracies. In our language, they transform regime-supporting contested political knowledge into regime-undermining common political knowledge. And much more recently, we have seen other uses of the same information flows undermining democracies by turning regime-supporting common political knowledge into regime-undermining contested political knowledge.</p>

<p>In other words, the same fake news techniques that benefit autocracies by making everyone unsure about political alternatives undermine democracies by making people question the common political systems that bind their society.</p>

<p>This framework not only helps us understand how different political systems are vulnerable and how they can be attacked, but also how to bolster security in democracies. First, we need to better defend the common political knowledge that democracies need to function. That is, we need to bolster public confidence in the institutions and systems that maintain a democracy. Second, we need to make it harder for outside political groups to cooperate with inside political groups and organize disinformation attacks, through measures like transparency in political funding and spending. And finally, we need to treat attacks on common political knowledge by insiders as being just as threatening as the same attacks by foreigners.</p>

<p>There's a lot more in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273111">the paper</a>.</p>

	    <p>Due to ever-evolving technological advances, manufacturers are connecting consumer goodsÂ­ -- from toys to light bulbs to major appliancesÂ­ -- to the Internet at breakneck speeds. This is the Internet of Things, and it's a security nightmare.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things fuses products with communications technology to make daily life more effortless. Think Amazon's Alexa, which not only answers questions and plays music but allows you to control your home's lights and thermostat. Or the current generation of implanted pacemakers, which can both receive commands and send information to doctors over the Internet.</p>

<p>But like nearly all innovation, there are risks involved. And for products born out of the Internet of Things, this means the risk of having personal information stolen or devices being overtaken and controlled remotely. For devices that affect the world in a direct physical manner -- Â­cars, pacemakers, thermostatsÂ­ -- the risks include loss of life and property.</p>

<p>By developing more advanced security features and building them into these products, hacks can be avoided. The problem is that there is no monetary incentive for companies to invest in the cybersecurity measures needed to keep their products secure. Consumers will buy products without proper security features, unaware that their information is vulnerable. And current liability laws make it hard to hold companies accountable for shoddy software security.</p>

<p>It falls upon lawmakers to create laws that protect consumers. While the US government is largely absent in this area of consumer protection, the state of California has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17874768/california-iot-smart-device-cybersecurity-bill-sb-327-signed-law">stepped</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/30/california-connected-device-laws/">in</a> and started regulating the Internet of Things, or "IoT" devices sold in the stateÂ­ -- and the effects will soon be felt worldwide.</p>

<p>California's new <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327">SB 327 law</a>, which will take effect in January 2020, requires all "connected devices" to have a "reasonable security feature." The good news is that the term "connected devices" is broadly defined to include just about everything connected to the Internet. The not-so-good news is that "reasonable security" remains defined such that companies trying to avoid compliance can argue that the law is unenforceable.</p>

<p>The legislation requires that security features must be able to protect the device and the information on it from a variety of threats and be appropriate to both the nature of the device and the information it collects. California's attorney general will interpret the law and define the specifics, which will surely be the subject of much lobbying by tech companies.</p>

<p>There's just one specific in the law that's not subject to the attorney general's interpretation: default passwords are not allowed. This is a good thing; they are a terrible security practice. But it's just one of dozens of awful "security" measures commonly found in IoT devices.</p>

<p>This law is not a <a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/09/californias-bad-iot-law.html#.W-SaLNVKhhE">panacea</a>. But we have to start somewhere, and it is a start.</p>

<p>Though the legislation covers only the state of California, its effects will reach much further. All of usÂ­ -- in the United States or elsewhereÂ­ -- are likely to benefit because of the way software is written and sold.</p>

<p>Automobile manufacturers sell their cars worldwide, but they are customized for local markets. The car you buy in the United States is different from the same model <a href="https://www.export.gov/article?id=Mexico-Automotive-Parts-and-Supplies">sold in Mexico</a>, because the local environmental laws are not the same and manufacturers optimize engines based on where the product will be sold. The economics of building and selling automobiles easily allows for this differentiation.</p>

<p>But software is different. Once California forces minimum security standards on IoT devices, manufacturers will have to rewrite their software to comply. At that point, it won't make sense to have two versions: one for California and another for everywhere else. It's much easier to maintain the single, more secure version and sell it everywhere.</p>

<p>The European General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://eugdpr.org/">GDPR</a>), which implemented the annoying warnings and agreements that pop up on websites, is another example of a law that extends well beyond physical borders. You might have noticed an increase in websites that force you to acknowledge you've read and agreed to the website's privacy policies. This is because it is tricky to differentiate between users who are subject to the protections of the GDPRÂ­ -- people physically in the European Union, and EU citizens wherever they are -- Â­and those who are not. It's easier to extend the protection to everyone.</p>

<p>Once this kind of sorting is possible, companies will, in all likelihood, return to their profitable surveillance capitalism practices on those who are still fair game. Surveillance is still the primary business model of the Internet, and companies want to spy on us and our activities as much as they can so they can sell us more things and monetize what they know about our behavior.</p>

<p>Insecurity is profitable only if you can get away with it worldwide. Once you can't, you might as well make a virtue out of necessity. So everyone will benefit from the California regulation, as they would from similar security regulations enacted in any market around the world large enough to matter, just like everyone will <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3254511">benefit</a> from the portion of GDPR compliance that involves data security.</p>

<p>Most importantly, laws like these spur innovations in cybersecurity. Right now, we have a market failure. Because the courts have traditionally not held software manufacturers <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/114973/bad-code-should-software-makers-pay-part-1">liable for vulnerabilities</a>, and because consumers don't have the expertise to differentiate between a secure product and an insecure one, manufacturers have prioritized low prices, getting devices out on the market quickly and additional features over security.</p>

<p>But once a government steps in and imposes more stringent security regulations, companies have an incentive to meet those standards as quickly, cheaply, and effectively as possible. This means more security innovation, because now there's a market for new ideas and new products. We've seen this pattern again and again in safety and security engineering, and we'll see it with the Internet of Things as well.</p>

<p>IoT devices are more <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/01/the-internet-of-things-dangerous-future-bruce-schneier.html">dangerous</a> than our traditional computers because they sense the world around us, and affect that world in a direct physical manner. Increasing the cybersecurity of these devices is paramount, and it's heartening to see both individual states and the European Union step in where the US federal government is abdicating responsibility. But we need more, and soon.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@chrisbuetti/how-i-eat-for-free-in-nyc-using-python-automation-artificial-intelligence-and-instagram-a5ed8a1e2a10">This</a> is a fascinating hack:</p>

<blockquote><p>In today's digital age, a large Instagram audience is considered a valuable currency. I had also heard through the grapevine that I could monetize a large following -- or in my desired case -- use it to have my meals paid for. <i>So I did just that</i>.

<p>I created an Instagram page that showcased pictures of New York City's skylines, iconic spots, elegant skyscrapers Â­-- you name it. The page has amassed a following of over 25,000 users in the NYC area and it's still rapidly growing.</p>

<p>I reach out restaurants in the area either via Instagram's direct messaging or email and offer to post a positive review in return for a free entree or at least a discount. Almost every restaurant I've messaged came back at me with a compensated meal or a gift card. Most places have an allocated marketing budget for these types of things so they were happy to offer me a free dining experience in exchange for a promotion. I've ended up giving some of these meals away to my friends and family because at times I had too many queued up to use myself.</p>

<p>The beauty of this all is that <b>I automated the whole thing</b>. And I mean 100% of it. I wrote code that finds these pictures or videos, makes a caption, adds hashtags, credits where the picture or video comes from, weeds out bad or spammy posts, posts them, follows and unfollows users, likes pictures, monitors my inbox, and most importantly -- both direct messages and emails restaurants about a potential promotion. Since its inception, I haven't even really logged into the account. I spend zero time on it. It's essentially a robot that operates like a human, but the average viewer can't tell the difference. And as the programmer, I get to sit back and admire its (and my) work.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much going on in this project.</p>

<p>Yes, clever and all. But I don't think I would be proud of this part:</p>

<p>"Now, none of the content my account posts is owned by me. This is a contested topicâââsome people seem to think this can lead to some issues. However, if you credit where the content comes from itâs usually not a problem. Iâve never had any issues re-sharing content. In fact, Iâve only had people thank me for sharing their photos. Worst case, someone reports your post and it gets taken down by Instagram. As long as you give credit where credit is due, you should be good."</p>

<p>He is not concerned about whether it is right to steal other people's content, just whether it gets in the way of him getting a free meal.</p>

<p>Yup it looks like it is a lot of work for a 'free meal'.</p>

<p>But it's not a 'free meal' at all.</p>

<p>Look at it from the other side, food in most restaurants is the least expensive part of the operation, you only have to look at the wine list prices to know where they try to make the most money.</p>

<p>They will see the cost of that meal as less than the postage and admin of getting the voucher to him. And way way less than they would otherwise have to pay for advertising via leaflets, local papers, hordings and the sides of busses. Knowing that the eyes on those going to that site are going to the site because they want to.</p>

<p>I would say the restaurants are getting a realy good deal out of his hard work, especially if he also leaves the staff a tip.</p>

<p>But it probably won't last because fairly soon lots of people will do the same thing, and as he notes there is a budjet for advertising.</p>

<p>But whilst it's going for him, I wish him the best at it, he's earned it.</p>

<p>Its OK, most of the followers of the Instagram account are probably bots too.</p>

<p>I predict that in the future, 90% of the world's economy will be bots sending spam to other bots, that filter and repackage it to spam it to other bots.</p>

<p>@zuc</p>

<p>That is not a new observation. Study the topic of clickjack fraud. Some astute commentators think that in the early years Google's entire business model was "fake it till you make it." The problem was that no one could ever come up with hard proof that Google was behind the problem. </p>

<p>More broadly I am reminded of the observation that highly advanced technology is the same as magic.</p>

<p>Clever, @zuc.</p>

<p>The other problem with this strategy is that the supply of restaurants is not unlimited.</p>

<p>@Jason</p>

<p>The supply of restaurants is not unlimited, but neither is the demand from a single person. Even if I lived in San Francisco, and could afford to dine out for every meal, I suspect I could not get around to every restaurant on a list created as a snapshot at a single instant. Many will go out of business before I reach their position in the list, to be replaced by others. Or, you know, I could get bored with the whole process, or maybe die, during this marathon review task.</p>

<p>And NYC has even more restaurants.</p>

<p>But I agree that if "everybody" (or even a noticeable fraction of the populace) did this, the scheme would collapse.</p>

<p>Hack: gain unauthorized access to data in a system or computer</p>

<p>The story is indeed fascinating but I can hardly call that a hack. Sure, OP is pretty skilled and is knowledgeable about automation/coding. Other parts are mostly trivial webmarketing tactics or Instagram uses (follow/unfollow, repost, direct messages, content scrapping, customization...).</p>

<p>@1&1~=Umm<br />
>  I would say the restaurants are getting a realy good deal out of his hard work, especially if he also leaves the staff a tip.<br />
Same, especially if this account manages to attract human users. Even 1% will be enough</p>

<p>@zuc<br />
> Its OK, most of the followers of the Instagram account are probably bots too.<br />
You're statistically right, but it's common sense. Most digital marketers know that too and they are willing to deal with bots noise if they can achieve a decent ROI. Platform metrics may be rigged but the bottom line does not lie.</p>

<p>When you factor in the time and resources the hacker spent on this project, I doubt he saved anything over just paying for his meals.  Meanwhile, those of us who will listen have now been warned that this parasitic practice is out there.</p>

<p>This is not interesting because of the free meals. Think of this technique used in more sophisticated influence campaigns.</p>

<p><i>and offer to post a positive review</i></p>

<p>It's not clear whether the review too was created automatically.</p>

<p>A "positive" review? Please, honest reviewing work doesn't work like that.</p>

<p>In the cult film "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XB0hTPKVKQ" rel="nofollow">L'aile ou la cuisse</a>" (1976), Louis de FunÃ¨s plays a "Guide Michelin" type inspector who visits restaurants incognito and bestows stars on them. In this scene he disguises as a clichÃ©d American tourist (complete with pink suit, purse, Hawaiian shirt, and 5-gallon hat) to check out a particularly seedy establishment. ("Where are the toilets please? Down the hallway, follow the flies".) [for some reason the punch line at the end was cut out.]</p>

<p><i>in return for a free entree or at least a discount.</i></p>

<p>Will eat for food!<br />

<p>@bruce</p>

<p>Yes, and what is startling is just how few real people need to be influnced for the viral contagion to happen. Studies in behavorial/social contagion indicate that a critical mass of between 5-15% is all that is needed before ideas and emotional affects begin to spread spontaneously  within a targeted population. There have been similar results found by those who study innovation propagation.</p>

<p>So one does not need to fool all the people all the time. Fool some of the people some of the time and these early converts will do the rest of the work of social influence. </p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011976"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/i_was_cited_in_.html">I Was Cited in a Court Decision</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>An <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2938033">article I co-wrote</a> -- my first law journal article -- was <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/03/06/12564.pdf">cited</a> by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court -- the state supreme court -- in a case on compelled decryption.</p>

<p>Here's the first, in footnote 1:</p>

<blockquote><p>We understand the word "password" to be synonymous with other terms that cell phone users may be familiar with, such as Personal Identification Number or "passcode." Each term refers to the personalized combination of letters or digits that, when manually entered by the user, "unlocks" a cell phone. For simplicity, we use "password" throughout. See generally, Kerr & Schneier, Encryption Workarounds, 106 Geo. L.J. 989, 990, 994, 998 (2018).</p></blockquote>

<p>And here's the second, in footnote 5:</p>

<blockquote><p>We recognize that ordinary cell phone users are likely unfamiliar with the complexities of encryption technology. For instance, although entering a password "unlocks" a cell phone, the password itself is not the "encryption key" that decrypts the cell phone's contents. See Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em> at 995. Rather, "entering the [password] decrypts the [encryption] key, enabling the key to be processed and unlocking the phone. This two-stage process is invisible to the casual user." <em>Id</em>. Because the technical details of encryption technology do not play a role in our analysis, they are not worth belaboring. Accordingly, we treat the entry of a password as effectively decrypting the contents of a cell phone. For a more detailed discussion of encryption technology, see generally Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em>.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011960"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/reverse_locatio.html">Reverse Location Search Warrants</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The police are increasingly <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/reverse-location-search-warrants-google-police.html">getting search warrants</a> for information about all cell phones in a certain location at a certain time:</p>

<blockquote><p>Police departments across the country have been knocking at Google's door for at least the last two years with warrants to tap into the company's extensive stores of cellphone location data. Known as "reverse location search warrants," these legal mandates allow law enforcement to sweep up the coordinates and movements of every cellphone in a broad area. The police can then check to see if any of the phones came close to the crime scene. In doing so, however, the police can end up not only fishing for a suspect, but also gathering the location data of potentially hundreds (or thousands) of innocent people. There have only been anecdotal reports of reverse location searches, so it's unclear how widespread the practice is, but privacy advocates worry that Google's data will eventually allow more and more departments to conduct indiscriminate searches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it's not just Google who can provide this information.</p>

<p>I am also reminded of a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csec-used-airport-wi-fi-to-track-canadian-travellers-edward-snowden-documents-1.2517881">Canadian</a> <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news2/pdf/airports_redacted.pdf">surveillance program</a> disclosed by Snowden.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time talking about this sort of thing in <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/data_and_goliath/"><i>Data and Goliath</i></a>. Once you have everyone under surveillance all the time, many things are possible.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (3/13): <a href="https://lers.google.com/signup_v2/landing">Here'</a> the portal law enforcement uses to make its requests.</p>

<blockquote><p>In a daring move that placed his life in danger, the I.T. consultant eventually gave the F.B.I. his system's secret encryption keys in 2011 after he had moved the network's servers from Canada to the Netherlands during what he told the cartel's leaders was a routine upgrade.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Dutch article <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nederlandse-politie-tapte-anderhalf-jaar-lang-alle-communicatie-van-mexicaanse-drugsbaron-el-chapo-~bab33a30/">says</a> that it's a BlackBerry system.</p>

<p>El Chapo had his IT person install "...spyware called FlexiSPY on the 'special phones' he had given to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, as well as to two of his lovers, including one who was a former Mexican lawmaker." That same software was used by the FBI when his IT person turned over the keys. Yet again we learn the lesson that a backdoor can be used against you.</p>

<p>And it doesn't have to be with the IT person's permission. A good intelligence agency can use the IT person's authorizations without his knowledge or consent. This is why the NSA <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/03/20/inside-nsa-secret-efforts-hunt-hack-system-administrators/">hunts sysadmins</a>.</p>

	    <p>BoingBoing has the <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/08/06/spideroak-warrant-canary-to-be.html">story</a>.</p>

<p>I have never quite trusted the idea of a warrant canary. But here it seems to have worked. (Presumably, if SpiderOak wanted to replace the warrant canary with a transparency report, they would have written something explaining their decision. To have it simply disappear is what we would expect if SpiderOak were being forced to comply with a US government request for personal data.)</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (8/9): SpiderOak has <a href="https://spideroak.com/articles/a-transparency-report-is-a-canary/">posted</a> an explanation claiming that the warrant canary did not die -- it just changed.</p>

<p>That's obviously false, because it did die. And a change is the functional equivalent -- that's how they work. So either they have received a National Security Letter and now have to pretend they did not, or they completely misunderstood what a warrant canary is and how it works. No one knows.</p>

<p>I have never fully trusted warrant canaries -- <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/canary-watch-one-year-later">this</a> EFF post explains why -- and this is an illustration.</p>

	    <p>If you're going to commit an illegal act, it's best <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/paul-manafort-couldnt-convert-pdfs-to-word-documents.html">not to discuss it in e-mail</a>. It's also best to Google tech instructions rather than asking someone else to do it:</p>

<blockquote><p>One new detail from the indictment, however, points to just <i>how</i> unsophisticated Manafort seems to have been. Here's the relevant passage from the indictment. I've bolded the most important bits:

<blockquote><p>Manafort and Gates made numerous false and fraudulent representations to secure the loans. For example, Manafort provided the bank with doctored [profit and loss statements] for [Davis Manafort Inc.] for both 2015 and 2016, overstating its income by millions of dollars. The doctored 2015 DMI P&L submitted to Lender D was the same false statement previously submitted to Lender C, which overstated DMI's income by more than $4 million. The doctored 2016 DMI P&L was inflated by Manafort by more than $3.5 million. To create the false 2016 P&L, on or about October 21, 2016, <b>Manafort emailed Gates a .pdf version</b> of the real 2016 DMI P&L, which showed a loss of more than $600,000. <b>Gates converted that .pdf into a "Word" document so that it could be edited</b>, which Gates sent back to Manafort. <b>Manafort altered that "Word" document</b> by adding more than $3.5 million in income. He then <b>sent this falsified P&L to Gates and asked that the "Word" document be converted back to a .pdf, which Gates did and returned to Manafort</b>. Manafort then sent the falsified 2016 DMI P&L .pdf to Lender D.</p></blockquote>

<p>So here's the essence of what went wrong for Manafort and Gates, according to Mueller's investigation: Manafort allegedly wanted to falsify his company's income, but he couldn't figure out how to edit the PDF. He therefore had Gates turn it into a Microsoft Word document for him, which led the two to bounce the documents back-and-forth over email. As attorney and blogger Susan Simpson <a href="https://twitter.com/TheViewFromLL2/status/966807752696909826">notes on Twitter</a>, Manafort's inability to complete a basic task on his own seems to have effectively "created an incriminating paper trail."</p></blockquote>

<p>If there's a lesson here, it's that the Internet constantly generates data about what people are doing on it, and that data is all potential evidence. The FBI is 100% wrong that they're <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4325815-Director-Wray-Testimony.html#document/p5/a392750">going dark</a>; it's really the <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-08-15%20Swire%20Testimony.pdf">golden age of surveillance</a>, and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/">FBI's panic</a> is really just its own <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/01/wiretap-backdoors/">lack of technical sophistication</a>. </p>

	    <p>For over a decade, civil libertarians have been fighting government mass surveillance of innocent Americans over the Internet. We've just lost an important battle. On January 18, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/19/trump-surveillance-extension-351136">President Trump</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fisa-section-702-renewal-congress/">signed</a> the renewal of Section 702, domestic mass surveillance became effectively a permanent part of US law.</p>

<p>Section 702 was initially passed in 2008, as an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. As the title of that law says, it was billed as a way for the NSA to spy on non-Americans located outside the United States. It was supposed to be an efficiency and cost-saving measure: the NSA was already permitted to tap communications cables located outside the country, and it was already permitted to tap communications cables from one foreign country to another that passed through the United States. Section 702 allowed it to tap those cables from inside the United States, where it was easier. It also allowed the NSA to request surveillance data directly from Internet companies under a program called PRISM.</p>

<p>The problem is that this authority also gave the NSA the ability to collect foreign communications and data in a way that <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/Incidental-collection">inherently and intentionally</a> also swept up Americans' communications as well, without a warrant. Other law enforcement agencies are allowed to ask the NSA to search those communications, give their contents to the FBI and other agencies and then <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/30/nsa-surveillance-fisa-section-702/">lie about their origins</a> in court.</p>

<p>In 1978, after Watergate had revealed the Nixon administration's abuses of power, we erected a wall between intelligence and law enforcement that prevented precisely this kind of sharing of surveillance data under any authority less restrictive than the Fourth Amendment. Weakening that wall is incredibly dangerous, and the NSA should never have been given this authority in the first place.</p>

<p>Arguably, it never was. The NSA had been doing this type of surveillance illegally for years, something that was first <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/13/us/nationalspecial3/13nsa.html">made public</a> in 2006. Section 702 was secretly used as a way to paper over that illegal collection, but nothing in the text of the later amendment gives the NSA this authority. We didn't know that the NSA was using this law as the statutory basis for this surveillance until Edward Snowden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/nsa-loophole-warrantless-searches-email-calls">showed us</a> in 2013.</p>

<p>Civil libertarians have been battling this law in both Congress and the courts ever since it was proposed, and the NSA's domestic surveillance activities even longer. What this most recent vote tells me is that we've lost that fight.</p>

<p>Section 702 was passed under George W. Bush in 2008, reauthorized under Barack Obama in 2012, and now reauthorized again under Trump. In all three cases, congressional support was bipartisan. It has survived multiple lawsuits by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the ACLU, and others. It has survived the revelations by Snowden that it was being used far more extensively than Congress or the public believed, and numerous <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/oti/blog/history-fisa-section-702-compliance-violations/">public reports</a> of violations of the law. It has even survived <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-signs-fisa-reauthorization-says-different-from-law-that-was-so-wrongly-abused-during-the-election/article/2646505">Trump's belief</a> that he was being personally spied on by the intelligence community, as well as any congressional fears that Trump could abuse the authority in the coming years. And though this extension lasts only six years, it's inconceivable to me that it will ever be repealed at this point.</p>

<p>So what do we do? If we can't fight this particular statutory authority, where's the new front on surveillance? There are, it turns out, reasonable modifications that target surveillance more generally, and not in terms of any particular statutory authority. We need to look at US surveillance law more generally.</p>

<p>First, we need to strengthen the minimization procedures to limit incidental collection. Since the Internet was developed, all the world's communications travel around in a single global network. It's impossible to collect only foreign communications, because they're invariably mixed in with domestic communications. This is called "incidental" collection, but that's a misleading name. It's collected knowingly, and searched regularly. The intelligence community needs much stronger restrictions on which American communications channels it can access without a court order, and rules that require they delete the data if they inadvertently collect it. More importantly, "collection" is defined as the point the NSA takes a copy of the communications, and not later when they search their databases.</p>

<p>Second, we need to limit how other law enforcement agencies can use incidentally collected information. Today, those agencies can query a database of incidental collection on Americans. The NSA can legally pass information to those other agencies. This has to stop. Data collected by the NSA under its foreign surveillance authority should not be used as a vehicle for domestic surveillance.</p>

<p>The most recent reauthorization modified this lightly, forcing the FBI to obtain a court order when querying the 702 data for a criminal investigation. There are still exceptions and loopholes, though.</p>

<p>Third, we need to end what's called "parallel construction." Today, when a law enforcement agency uses evidence found in this NSA database to arrest someone, it doesn't have to disclose that fact in court. It can reconstruct the evidence in some other manner once it knows about it, and then pretend it learned of it that way. This right to lie to the judge and the defense is corrosive to liberty, and it must end.</p>

<p>Pressure to reform the NSA will probably first come from Europe. Already, European Union courts have pointed to warrantless NSA surveillance as a reason to keep Europeans' data out of US hands. Right now, there is a fragile agreement between the EU and the United States Â­-- called "<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">Privacy Shield</a>" -- Â­that requires Americans to maintain certain safeguards for international data flows. NSA surveillance goes against that, and it's only a matter of time before EU courts start ruling this way. That'll have significant effects on both government and corporate surveillance of Europeans and, by extension, the entire world.</p>

<p>Further pressure will come from the increased surveillance coming from the Internet of Things. When your home, car, and body are awash in sensors, privacy from both governments and corporations will become increasingly important. Sooner or later, society will reach a tipping point where it's all too much. When that happens, we're going to see significant pushback against surveillance of all kinds. That's when we'll get new laws that revise all government authorities in this area: a clean sweep for a new world, one with new norms and new fears.</p>

<p>It's possible that a federal court will rule on Section 702. Although there have been many lawsuits challenging the legality of what the NSA is doing and the constitutionality of the 702 program, no court has ever ruled on those questions. The Bush and Obama administrations successfully argued that defendants don't have legal standing to sue. That is, they have no right to sue because they don't know they're being targeted. If any of the lawsuits can get past that, things might change dramatically.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, much of this is the responsibility of the tech sector. This problem exists primarily because Internet companies collect and retain so much personal data and allow it to be sent across the network with minimal security. Since the government has abdicated its responsibility to protect our privacy and security, these companies need to step up: Minimize data collection. Don't save data longer than absolutely necessary. Encrypt what has to be saved. Well-designed Internet services will safeguard users, regardless of government surveillance authority.</p>

<p>For the rest of us concerned about this, it's important not to give up hope. Everything we do to keep the issue in the public eye Â­-- and not just when the authority comes up for reauthorization again in 2024 -- hastens the day when we will reaffirm our rights to privacy in the digital age.</p>

	    <p>The cell phones we carry with us constantly are the most perfect surveillance device ever invented, and our laws haven't caught up to that reality. That might change soon.</p>

<p>This week, the Supreme Court will hear a case with profound implications for your security and privacy in the coming years. The Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unlawful search and seizure is a vital right that protects us all from police overreach, and the way the courts interpret it is increasingly nonsensical in our computerized and networked world. The Supreme Court can either update current law to reflect the world, or it can further solidify an unnecessary and dangerous police power.</p>

<p>The case centers on cell phone location data and whether the police need a warrant to get it, or if they can use a simple subpoena, which is easier to obtain. Current Fourth Amendment doctrine holds that you lose all privacy protections over any data you willingly share with a third party. Your cellular provider, under this interpretation, is a third party with whom you've willingly shared your movements, 24 hours a day, going back months -- even though you don't really have any choice about whether to share with them. So police can request records of where you've been from cell carriers without any judicial oversight. The case before the court, <i>Carpenter v. United States</i>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/06/05/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-carpenter-v-united-states-the-fourth-amendment-historical-cell-site-case/">could change that</a>.</p>

<p>Traditionally, information that was most precious to us was physically close to us. It was on our bodies, in our homes and offices, in our cars. Because of that, the courts gave that information extra protections. Information that we stored far away from us, or gave to other people, afforded fewer protections. Police searches have been governed by the "<a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_services/law_national_security/patriot_debates2/the_book_online/ch4/ch4_ess2.html">third-party doctrine</a>," which explicitly says that information we share with others is not considered private.</p>

<p>The Internet has turned that thinking upside-down. Our cell phones know who we talk to and, if we're talking via text or e-mail, what we say. They track our location constantly, so they know where we live and work. Because they're the first and last thing we check every day, they know when we go to sleep and when we wake up. Because everyone has one, they know whom we sleep with. And because of how those phones work, all that information is naturally shared with third parties.</p>

<p>More generally, all our data is literally stored on computers belonging to other people. It's our e-mail, text messages, photos, Google docs, and more Â­ all in the cloud. We store it there not because it's unimportant, but precisely because it is important. And as the Internet of Things computerizes the rest our lives, even more data will be collected by other people: data from our health trackers and medical devices, data from our home sensors and appliances, data from Internet-connected "listeners" like Alexa, Siri, and your voice-activated television.</p>

<p>All this data will be collected and saved by third parties, sometimes for years. The result is a detailed dossier of your activities more complete than any private investigator --Â­ or police officer --Â­ could possibly collect by following you around.</p>

<p>The issue here is not whether the police should be allowed to use that data to help solve crimes. Of course they should. The issue is whether that information should be protected by the warrant process that requires the police to have probable cause to investigate you and get approval by a court.</p>

<p>Warrants are a security mechanism. They prevent the police from abusing their authority to investigate someone they have no reason to suspect of a crime. They prevent the police from going on "fishing expeditions." They protect our rights and liberties, even as we willingly give up our privacy to the legitimate needs of law enforcement.</p>

<p>The third-party doctrine never made a lot of sense. Just because I share an intimate secret with my spouse, friend, or doctor doesn't mean that I no longer consider it private. It makes even less sense in today's hyper-connected world. It's long past time the Supreme Court recognized that a months-long history of my movements is private, and my e-mails and other personal data deserve the same protections, whether they're on my laptop or on Google's servers.</p>

	    <p><i>New York Times</i> reporter Charlie Savage <a href="https://www.charliesavage.com/?p=1714">writes</a> about some bad statistics we're all using:</p>

<blockquote><p>Among surveillance legal policy specialists, it is common to cite a set of statistics from an October 2011 opinion by Judge John Bates, then of the FISA Court, about the volume of internet communications the National Security Agency was collecting under the FISA Amendments Act ("Section 702") warrantless surveillance program. In his opinion, declassified in August 2013, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1155040-fisc-ruling-bates-2011.html#document/p29/a156668">Judge Bates wrote that the NSA was collecting more than 250 million internet communications a year</a>, of which 91 percent came from its Prism system (which collects stored e-mails from providers like Gmail) and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1155040-fisc-ruling-bates-2011.html#document/p30/a156669">9 percent came from its upstream system</a> (which collects transmitted messages from network operators like AT&T).

<p>These numbers are wrong. This blog post will address, first, the widespread nature of this misunderstanding; second, how I came to FOIA certain documents trying to figure out whether the numbers really added up; third, what those documents show; and fourth, what I further learned in talking to an intelligence official. This is far too dense and weedy for a New York Times article, but should hopefully be of some interest to specialists.</p></blockquote>

<p>Worth reading for the details. </p>

	    <p>The US Supreme Court is deciding a case that will establish whether the police need a warrant to access cell phone location data. This week I signed on to an <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3932663/Carpenter-Amicus-Brief-Technology-Experts.pdf">amicus brief</a> from a wide array of security technologists outlining the technical arguments as why the answer should be yes. Susan Landau <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/phones-move-%E2%80%93%C2%A0and-so-should-law">summarized</a> our arguments.</p>

<p>A bunch of tech companies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-mobilephone-idUSKCN1AV1B3">also submitted</a> a brief.</p>

	    <p>Secret NSA eavesdropping is still in the news. Details about once secret programs <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/world/nsa-dragnet-included-allies-aid-groups-and-business-elite.html">continue</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/20/gchq-targeted-aid-agencies-german-government-eu-commissioner">to</a> <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/snowden-documents-show-gchq-targeted-european-and-german-politicians-a-940135.html">leak</a>. The Director of National Intelligence has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/21/national-intelligence-bush-era-nsa-documents">recently</a> <a href="http://icontherecord.tumblr.com/post/70683717031/dni-announces-the-declassification-of-the">declassified</a> additional information, and the President's Review Group has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2013-12-12_rg_final_report.pdf">just</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/opinion/protecting-citizens-and-their-privacy.html">released</a> its report and recommendations.</p>
<p>With all this going on, it's easy to become inured to the breadth and depth of the NSA's activities. But through the disclosures, we've learned an enormous amount about the agency's capabilities, how it is failing to protect us, and what we need to do to regain security in the Information Age.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the surveillance state is robust. It is robust politically, legally, and technically. I can <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html">name</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html">three</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html">different</a> NSA programs to collect Gmail user data. These programs are based on three different technical eavesdropping capabilities. They rely on three different legal authorities. They involve collaborations with three different companies. And this is just Gmail. The same is true for cell phone call records, Internet chats, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html">cell-phone</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/10/new-documents-show-how-the-nsa-infers-relationships-based-on-mobile-location-data/">location</a> data.</p>
<p>Second, the NSA continues <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/new-evidence-that-the-head-of-the-nsa-misled-us/282365/">to lie</a> about its capabilities. It hides behind tortured interpretations of words like "<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/director-national-intelligences-word-games-explained-how-government-deceived">collect</a>," <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/12/how-to-tell-when-the-nsa-is-lying.html">"incidentally," "target," and "directed."</a> It cloaks programs in multiple code names to obscure their full extent and capabilities. Officials testify that a particular surveillance activity is not done under one particular program or authority, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/how-americans-were-deceived-about-cell-phone-location-data/282239/">conveniently omitting</a> that it is done under some other program or authority.</p>
<p>Third, U.S. government surveillance is not just about the NSA. The Snowden documents <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/nsadocs">have</a> <a href="https://www.aclu.org/nsa-documents-released-public-june-2013">given</a> <a href="http://cryptome.org/2013/11/snowden-tally.htm">us</a> <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/326632176/nsa-css">extraordinary</a> <a href="http://www.tedgioia.com/nsa_facts.html">details</a> about the NSA's activities, but we now know that the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/SB10001424052702303559504579198370113163530-lMyQjAxMTAzMDEwNDExNDQyWj">CIA</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/12/new-us-spy-satellite-features-world-devouring-octopus/">NRO</a>, <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/11/21/the_obscure_fbi_team_that_does_the_nsa_dirty_work">FBI</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/us/drug-agents-use-vast-phone-trove-eclipsing-nsas.html">DEA</a>, and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/08/cellphone-data-spying-nsa-police/3902809/">local police</a> all engage in ubiquitous surveillance using the same sorts of eavesdropping tools, and that they <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805">regularly</a> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/07/us-dea-irs-idUSBRE9761AZ20130807">share</a> information with each other.</p>
<p>The NSA's collect-everything mentality is largely a hold-over from the Cold War, when a voyeuristic interest in the Soviet Union was the norm. Still, it is unclear how effective targeted surveillance against "enemy" countries really is. Even when we learn actual secrets, as we did regarding Syria's use of chemical weapons earlier this year, we often <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/the_limitations.html">can't do anything</a> with the information.</p>
<p>Ubiquitous surveillance should have died with the fall of Communism, but it got a newâand even more dangerousâlife with the intelligence community's post-9/11 "never again" terrorism mission. This quixotic goal of preventing something from happening forces us to try to know <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/11/dan_geer_explai.html">everything that does happen</a>. This pushes the NSA to eavesdrop on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/world/spies-dragnet-reaches-a-playing-field-of-elves-and-trolls.html">online gaming worlds</a> and on every cell phone in the world. But it's a fool's errand; there are simply too many ways to communicate.</p>
<p>We have <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/08/nsa-bulk-metadata-surveillance-intelligence">no evidence</a> that any of this surveillance makes us safer. NSA Director General Keith Alexander responded to these stories in June by <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/27/19175466-nsa-chief-says-surveillance-programs-helped-foil-54-plots">claiming</a> that he disrupted 54 terrorist plots. In October, he <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/10/02/nsa_director_admits_to_misleading_public_on_terror_plots/">revised</a> that number downward to 13, and then to "one or two." <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/23/nsa-attacks-thwarted_n_4148811.html">At this point</a>, the only "plot" prevented was that of a San Diego man sending $8,500 to support a Somali militant group. We have been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/30/heres-why-nsa-officials-never-seem-to-stop-talking-about-911/">repeatedly</a> told that these surveillance programs would have been able to stop 9/11, yet the NSA didn't detect the Boston bombingsâeven though one of the two terrorists was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/24/us-usa-explosions-boston-suspect-idUSBRE93N06720130424">on the watch list</a> and the other had a <a href="http://storify.com/MacleansMag/the-social-media-trail-of-tsarnaev-brothers">sloppy social media trail</a>. Bulk collection of data and metadata is an ineffective counterterrorism tool.</p>
<p>Not only is ubiquitous surveillance <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/30/opinion/bergen-nsa-surveillance-september-11/index.html">ineffective</a>, it is extraordinarily costly. I don't mean just the <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-29/world/41709796_1_intelligence-community-intelligence-spending-national-intelligence-program">budgets</a>, which will continue to skyrocket. Or the diplomatic costs, as country after country learns of our surveillance programs against their citizens. I'm also talking about the cost to our society. It breaks so much of what our society has built. It breaks our political systems, as Congress is unable to provide any <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPnfgUkcvOk">meaningful</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/25/nsa-no-congress-oversight">oversight</a> and citizens are kept in the dark about what government does. It breaks our legal systems, as laws <a href="https://www.aclu.org/national-security/nsa-collating-data-americans-facebook-gps-tax-other-records">are</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/16/nsa-fbi-endrun-weak-oversight">ignored</a> <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/356159/sensenbrenner-nsa-surveillance-abuse-patriot-act-john-fund">or</a> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/07/mission-creep-when-everything-is-terrorism/277844/">reinterpreted</a>, and people are unable to challenge government actions in court. It breaks our commercial systems, as U.S. computer products and services are no longer trusted worldwide. It breaks our technical systems, as the very protocols of the Internet become untrusted. And it breaks our social systems; the loss of privacy, freedom, and liberty is much more damaging to our society than the occasional act of random violence.</p>
<p>And finally, these systems are susceptible to abuse. This is not just a hypothetical problem. Recent history illustrates many episodes where this information was, or would have been, abused: Hoover and his FBI spying, McCarthy, Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement, anti-war Vietnam protesters, andâmore recentlyâthe Occupy movement. Outside the U.S., there are even more extreme examples. Building the surveillance state makes it too easy for people and organizations to slip over the line into abuse.</p>
<p>It's not just domestic abuse we have to worry about; it's the rest of the world, too. The more we choose to eavesdrop on the Internet and other communications technologies, the less we are secure from eavesdropping by others. Our choice isn't between a digital world where the NSA can eavesdrop and one where the NSA is prevented from eavesdropping; it's between a digital world that is vulnerable to all attackers, and one that is secure for all users.</p>
<p>Fixing this problem is going to be hard. We are long past the point where simple legal interventions can help. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/usa-freedom-act-real-spying-reform">bill in Congress</a> to limit NSA surveillance <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/floor-not-ceiling-supporting-usa-freedom-act-step-towards-less-surveillance">won't actually do much</a> to limit NSA surveillance. Maybe the NSA will figure out an interpretation of the law that will allow it to do what it wants anyway. Maybe it'll do it another way, using another justification. Maybe the FBI will do it and give it a copy. And when asked, it'll lie about it.</p>
<p>NSA-level surveillance is like the Maginot Line was in the years before World War II: ineffective and wasteful. We need to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-447.html">openly</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-435.html">disclose</a> what surveillance we have been doing, and the known insecurities that make it possible. We need to work toward security, even if other countries like China continue to use the Internet as a giant surveillance platform. We need to build a coalition of free-world nations dedicated to a secure global Internet, and we need to continually push back against bad actorsâboth state and non-stateâthat work against that goal.</p>
<p>Securing the Internet requires both laws and technology. It requires Internet technology that secures data wherever it is and however it travels. It requires broad laws that <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-452.html">put security ahead of both domestic and international surveillance</a>. It requires additional technology to enforce those laws, and a worldwide enforcement regime to deal with bad actors. It's not easy, and has all the problems that other international issues have: nuclear, chemical, and biological weapon non-proliferation; small arms trafficking; human trafficking; money laundering; intellectual property. Global information security and anti-surveillance needs to join those difficult global problems, so we can start making progress.</p>
<p>The President's Review Group recommendations are largely positive, but they don't go nearly far enough. We need to recognize that security is more important than surveillance, and work towards that goal.</p>

	    <p>IoT devices are surveillance devices, and manufacturers generally use them to collect data on their customers. Surveillance is still the business model of the Internet, and this data is used against the customers' interests: either by the device manufacturer or by some third party the manufacturer sells the data to. Of course, this data can be used by the police as well; the purpose depends on the country. </p>

<p>None of this is new, and much of it was discussed in my book <i><a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/data_and_goliath/">Data and Goliath</a></i>. What is common is for Internet companies is to publish "transparency reports" that give at least general information about how police are using that data. IoT companies don't publish those reports.</p>

<p>TechCrunch asked a bunch of companies about this, and basically found that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/19/smart-home-devices-hoard-data-government-demands/">no one is talking</a>.</p>

	    <p>Interesting <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-l-a-s-anti-terrorist-subway-scanners-be-adopted-everywhere/">article</a> on terahertz millimeter-wave scanners and their uses to detect terrorist bombers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The heart of the device is a block of electronics about the size of a 1990s tower personal computer. It comes housed in a musician's black case, akin to the one Spinal Tap might use on tour. At the front: a large, square white plate, the terahertz camera and, just above it, an ordinary closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera. Mounted on a shelf inside the case is a laptop that displays the CCTV image and the blobby terahertz image side by side.

<p>An operator compares the two images as people flow past, looking for unexplained dark areas that could represent firearms or suicide vests. Most images that might be mistaken for a weaponÂ­ -- backpacks or a big patch of sweat on the back of a person's shirtÂ­ -- are easily evaluated by observing the terahertz image alongside an unaltered video picture of the passenger.</p>

<p>It is up to the operatorÂ­ -- in LA's case, presumably a transport police officerÂ­ -- to query people when dark areas on the terahertz image suggest concealed large weapons or suicide vests. The device cannot see inside bodies, backpacks or shoes. "If you look at previous incidents on public transit systems, this technology would have detected those," Sotero says, noting LA Metro worked "closely" with the TSA for over a year to test this and other technologies. "It definitely has the backing of TSA."</p>

<p>How the technology works in practice depends heavily on the operator's training. According to Evans, "A lot of tradecraft goes into understanding where the threat item is likely to be on the body." He sees the crucial role played by the operator as giving back control to security guards and allowing them to use their common sense.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am quoted in the article as being skeptical of the technology, particularly how its deployed.</p>

	    <p>Suprising no one, the security of police bodycams is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/police-body-camera-vulnerabilities/">terrible</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mitchell even realized that because he can remotely access device storage on models like the Fire Cam OnCall, an attacker could potentially plant malware on some of the cameras. Then, when the camera connects to a PC for syncing, it could deliver all sorts of malicious code: a Windows exploit that could ultimately allow an attacker to gain remote access to the police network, ransomware to spread across the network and lock everything down, a worm that infiltrates the department's evidence servers and deletes everything, or even cryptojacking software to mine cryptocurrency using police computing resources. Even a body camera with no Wi-Fi connection, like the CeeSc, can be compromised if a hacker gets physical access. "You know not to trust thumb drives, but these things have the same ability," Mitchell says.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011668"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/new_report_on_p.html">New Report on Police Digital Forensics Techniques</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>According to a new <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/low-hanging-fruit-evidence-based-solutions-digital-evidence-challenge">CSIS report</a>, "going dark" is not the most pressing problem facing law enforcement in the age of digital data:</p>

<blockquote><p>Over the past year, we conducted a series of interviews with federal, state, and local law enforcement officials, attorneys, service providers, and civil society groups. We also commissioned a survey of law enforcement officers from across the country to better understand the full range of difficulties they are facing in accessing and using digital evidence in their cases. Survey results indicate that accessing data from service providers -- much of which is not encrypted -- is the biggest problem that law enforcement currently faces in leveraging digital evidence.

<p>This is a problem that has not received adequate attention or resources to date. An array of federal and state training centers, crime labs, and other efforts have arisen to help fill the gaps, but they are able to fill only a fraction of the need. And there is no central entity responsible for monitoring these efforts, taking stock of the demand, and providing the assistance needed. The key federal entity with an explicit mission to assist state and local law enforcement with their digital evidence needsÂ­ -- the National Domestic Communications Assistance Center (NDCAC)Â­has a budget of $11.4 million, spread among several different programs designed to distribute knowledge about service providers' poliÂ­cies and products, develop and share technical tools, and train law enforcement on new services and techÂ­nologies, among other initiatives.</p></blockquote>

<p>From a <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2018/07/25/out-today-report-on-law-enforcements-fight-to-uncover-digital-evidence-296783">news article</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In addition to bemoaning the lack of guidance and help from tech companies -- a quarter of survey respondents said their top issue was convincing companies to hand over suspects' data -- law enforcement officials also reported receiving barely any digital evidence training. Local police said they'd received only 10 hours of training in the past 12 months; state police received 13 and federal officials received 16. A plurality of respondents said they only received annual training. Only 16 percent said their organizations scheduled training sessions at least twice per year.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a point that Susan Landau has <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Landau-Written-Testimony.pdf">repeatedly made</a>, and also one I make in my <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">new book</a>. The FBI needs technical expertise, not backdoors.</p>

	    <p>This <a href="https://apnews.com/1a35310fb6aa440a81fe8ae3da5afbed">article</a> says that the Virginia Beach police are looking to buy encrypted radios.</p>

<blockquote><p>Virginia Beach police believe encryption will prevent criminals from listening to police communications. They said officer safety would increase and citizens would be better protected.</p></blockquote>

<p>Someone should ask them if they want those radios to have a backdoor. </p>

	    <p>Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-rod-j-rosenstein-delivers-remarks-cambridge-cyber-summit ">given talks</a> where he proposes that tech companies decrease their communications and device security for the benefit of the FBI. In a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-rosenstein-delivers-remarks-2017-north-american-international">recent talk</a>, his idea is that tech companies just save a copy of the plaintext:</p>

<blockquote><p>Law enforcement can also partner with private industry to address a problem we call "Going Dark."  Technology increasingly frustrates traditional law enforcement efforts to collect evidence needed to protect public safety and solve crime.  For example, many instant-messaging services now encrypt messages by default. The prevent the police from reading those messages, even if an impartial judge approves their interception.

<p>The problem is especially critical because electronic evidence is necessary for both the investigation of a cyber incident and the prosecution of the perpetrator.  If we cannot access data even with lawful process, we are unable to do our job. Our ability to secure systems and prosecute criminals depends on our ability to gather evidence.</p>

<p>I encourage you to carefully consider your company's interests and how you can work cooperatively with us.  Although encryption can help secure your data, it may also prevent law enforcement agencies from protecting your data.</p>

<p>Encryption serves a valuable purpose. It is a foundational element of data security and essential to safeguarding data against cyber-attacks. It is critical to the growth and flourishing of the digital economy, and we support it. I support strong and responsible encryption.</p>

<p>I simply maintain that companies should retain the capability to provide the government unencrypted copies of communications and data stored on devices, when a court orders them to do so.</p>

<p>Responsible encryption is effective secure encryption, coupled with access capabilities. We know encryption can include safeguards. For example, there are systems that include central management of security keys and operating system updates; scanning of content, like your e-mails, for advertising purposes; simulcast of messages to multiple destinations at once; and key recovery when a user forgets the password to decrypt a laptop.  No one calls any of those functions a "backdoor." In fact, those very capabilities are marketed and sought out.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the government should mandate a specific means of ensuring access. The government does not need to micromanage the engineering.</p>

<p>The question is whether to require a particular goal: When a court issues a search warrant or wiretap order to collect evidence of crime, the company should be able to help.  The government does not need to hold the key.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rosenstein is right that many services like Gmail naturally keep plaintext in the cloud. This is something we pointed out in our 2016 paper: "<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">Don't Panic</a>." But forcing companies to build an alternate means to access the plaintext that the user can't control is an enormous vulnerability.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011382"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/11/warrant_protect.html">Warrant Protections against Police Searches of Our Data</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The cell phones we carry with us constantly are the most perfect surveillance device ever invented, and our laws haven't caught up to that reality. That might change soon.</p>

<p>This week, the Supreme Court will hear a case with profound implications for your security and privacy in the coming years. The Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unlawful search and seizure is a vital right that protects us all from police overreach, and the way the courts interpret it is increasingly nonsensical in our computerized and networked world. The Supreme Court can either update current law to reflect the world, or it can further solidify an unnecessary and dangerous police power.</p>

<p>The case centers on cell phone location data and whether the police need a warrant to get it, or if they can use a simple subpoena, which is easier to obtain. Current Fourth Amendment doctrine holds that you lose all privacy protections over any data you willingly share with a third party. Your cellular provider, under this interpretation, is a third party with whom you've willingly shared your movements, 24 hours a day, going back months -- even though you don't really have any choice about whether to share with them. So police can request records of where you've been from cell carriers without any judicial oversight. The case before the court, <i>Carpenter v. United States</i>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/06/05/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-carpenter-v-united-states-the-fourth-amendment-historical-cell-site-case/">could change that</a>.</p>

<p>Traditionally, information that was most precious to us was physically close to us. It was on our bodies, in our homes and offices, in our cars. Because of that, the courts gave that information extra protections. Information that we stored far away from us, or gave to other people, afforded fewer protections. Police searches have been governed by the "<a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_services/law_national_security/patriot_debates2/the_book_online/ch4/ch4_ess2.html">third-party doctrine</a>," which explicitly says that information we share with others is not considered private.</p>

<p>The Internet has turned that thinking upside-down. Our cell phones know who we talk to and, if we're talking via text or e-mail, what we say. They track our location constantly, so they know where we live and work. Because they're the first and last thing we check every day, they know when we go to sleep and when we wake up. Because everyone has one, they know whom we sleep with. And because of how those phones work, all that information is naturally shared with third parties.</p>

<p>More generally, all our data is literally stored on computers belonging to other people. It's our e-mail, text messages, photos, Google docs, and more Â­ all in the cloud. We store it there not because it's unimportant, but precisely because it is important. And as the Internet of Things computerizes the rest our lives, even more data will be collected by other people: data from our health trackers and medical devices, data from our home sensors and appliances, data from Internet-connected "listeners" like Alexa, Siri, and your voice-activated television.</p>

<p>All this data will be collected and saved by third parties, sometimes for years. The result is a detailed dossier of your activities more complete than any private investigator --Â­ or police officer --Â­ could possibly collect by following you around.</p>

<p>The issue here is not whether the police should be allowed to use that data to help solve crimes. Of course they should. The issue is whether that information should be protected by the warrant process that requires the police to have probable cause to investigate you and get approval by a court.</p>

<p>Warrants are a security mechanism. They prevent the police from abusing their authority to investigate someone they have no reason to suspect of a crime. They prevent the police from going on "fishing expeditions." They protect our rights and liberties, even as we willingly give up our privacy to the legitimate needs of law enforcement.</p>

<p>The third-party doctrine never made a lot of sense. Just because I share an intimate secret with my spouse, friend, or doctor doesn't mean that I no longer consider it private. It makes even less sense in today's hyper-connected world. It's long past time the Supreme Court recognized that a months-long history of my movements is private, and my e-mails and other personal data deserve the same protections, whether they're on my laptop or on Google's servers.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011357"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/11/daphne_caruana_.html">Daphne Caruana Galizia's Murder and the Security of WhatsApp</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Daphne Caruana Galizia was a Maltese journalist whose anti-corruption investigations exposed powerful people. She was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/daphne-caruana-galizia-malta-journalist-funeral-justice-car-bomb-valletta-a8038531.html">murdered</a> in October by a car bomb.</p>

<p>Galizia used WhatsApp to <a href="https://daphnecaruanagalizia.com/2017/04/former-current-employees-malta-financial-services-authority-financial-intelligence-analysis-unit-police-state-authorities-pilatus-bank-can-contact-full-confid/">communicate securely</a> with her sources. Now that she is dead, the Maltese police want to break into her phone or the app, and find out who those sources were.</p>

<p>One journalist <a href="http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-10-25/local-news/Daphne-s-murder-Laptop-was-not-found-on-the-crime-scene-sources-6736180615">reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Part of Daphne's destroyed smart phone was elevated from the scene.

<p>Investigators say that Caruana Galizia had not taken her laptop with her on that particular trip. If she had done so, the forensic experts would have found evidence on the ground.</p>

<p>Her mobile phone is also being examined, as can be seen from her WhatsApp profile, which has registered activity since the murder. But it is understood that the data is safe.</p>

<p>Sources close to the newsroom said that as part of the investigation her sim card has been cloned. This is done with the help of mobile service providers in similar cases. Asked if her WhatsApp messages or any other messages that were stored in her phone will be retrieved, the source said that since the messaging application is encrypted, the messages cannot be seen. Therefore it is unlikely that any data can be retrieved.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am less optimistic than that reporter. The FBI is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malta-carbomb-usa/u-s-condemns-killing-of-malta-journalist-says-fbi-assisting-probe-idUSKBN1CM2VM">providing "specific assistance</a>." The article doesn't explain that, but I would not be surprised if they were helping crack the phone.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if WhatsApp's security survives this. My guess is that it depends on how much of the phone was recovered from the bombed car.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (11/7): The court-appointed IT expert on the case has a <a href="https://www.timesofmalta.com/mobile/articles/view/20171030/local/rejected-expert-appointed-to-caruana-galizia-murder-probe.661612">criminal record in the UK</a> for theft and forgery.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011346"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/10/the_science_of_.html">The Science of Interrogation</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Fascinating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/13/the-scientists-persuading-terrorists-to-spill-their-secrets">article</a> about two psychologists who are studying interrogation techniques.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, two British researchers are quietly revolutionising the study and practice of interrogation. Earlier this year, in a meeting room at the University of Liverpool, I watched a video of the Diola interview alongside Laurence Alison, the university's chair of forensic psychology, and Emily Alison, a professional counsellor. My permission to view the tape was negotiated with the counter-terrorist police, who are understandably wary of allowing outsiders access to such material. Details of the interview have been changed to protect the identity of the officers involved, though the quotes are verbatim.

<p>The Alisons, husband and wife, have done something no scholars of interrogation have been able to do before. Working in close cooperation with the police, who allowed them access to more than 1,000 hours of tapes, they have observed and analysed hundreds of real-world interviews with terrorists suspected of serious crimes. No researcher in the world has ever laid hands on such a haul of data before. Based on this research, they have constructed the world's first empirically grounded and comprehensive model of interrogation tactics.</p>

<p>The Alisons' findings are changing the way law enforcement and security agencies approach the delicate and vital task of gathering human intelligence. "I get very little, if any, pushback from practitioners when I present the Alisons' work," said Kleinman, who now teaches interrogation tactics to military and police officers. "Even those who don't have a clue about the scientific method, it just resonates with them." The Alisons have done more than strengthen the hand of advocates of non-coercive interviewing: they have provided an unprecedentedly authoritative account of what works and what does not, rooted in a profound understanding of human relations. That they have been able to do so is testament to a joint preoccupation with police interviews that stretches back more than 20 years.</p></blockquote>

<p>The most common retort against privacy advocates -- by those in favor of ID checks, cameras, databases, data mining and other wholesale surveillance measures -- is this line: "If you aren't doing anything wrong, what do you have to hide?"</p>
<p>Some clever answers: "If I'm not doing anything wrong, then you have no cause to watch me." "Because the government gets to define what's wrong, and they keep changing the definition." "Because you might do something wrong with my information." My problem with quips like these -- as right as they are -- is that they accept the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong. It's not. Privacy is an inherent human right, and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>Two proverbs say it best: <cite>Quis custodiet custodes ipsos?</cite> ("Who watches the watchers?") and "Absolute power corrupts absolutely."</p>
<p>Cardinal Richelieu understood the value of surveillance when he famously said, "If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged." Watch someone long enough, and you'll find something to arrest -- or just blackmail -- with. Privacy is important because without it, surveillance information will be abused: to peep, to sell to marketers and to spy on political enemies -- whoever they happen to be at the time.</p>
<p>Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power, even if we're doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance.</p>
<p>We do nothing wrong when we make love or go to the bathroom. We are not deliberately hiding anything when we seek out private places for reflection or conversation. We keep private journals, sing in the privacy of the shower, and write letters to secret lovers and then burn them. Privacy is a basic human need.</p>
<p>A future in which privacy would face constant assault was so alien to the framers of the Constitution that it never occurred to them to call out privacy as an explicit right. Privacy was inherent to the nobility of their being and their cause. <em>Of course</em> being watched in your own home was unreasonable. Watching at all was an act so unseemly as to be inconceivable among gentlemen in their day. You watched convicted criminals, not free citizens. You ruled your own home. It's intrinsic to the concept of liberty.</p>
<p>For if we are observed in all matters, we are constantly under threat of correction, judgment, criticism, even plagiarism of our own uniqueness. We become children, fettered under watchful eyes, constantly fearful that -- either now or in the uncertain future -- patterns we leave behind will be brought back to implicate us, by whatever authority has now become focused upon our once-private and innocent acts. We lose our individuality, because everything we do is observable and recordable.</p>
<p>How many of us have paused during conversation in the past four-and-a-half years, suddenly aware that we might be eavesdropped on? Probably it was a phone conversation, although maybe it was an e-mail or instant-message exchange or a conversation in a public place. Maybe the topic was terrorism, or politics, or Islam. We stop suddenly, momentarily afraid that our words might be taken out of context, then we laugh at our paranoia and go on. But our demeanor has changed, and our words are subtly altered.</p>
<p>This is the loss of freedom we face when our privacy is taken from us. This is life in former East Germany, or life in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. And it's our future as we allow an ever-intrusive eye into our personal, private lives.</p>
<p>Too many wrongly characterize the debate as "security versus privacy." The real choice is liberty versus control. Tyranny, whether it arises under threat of foreign physical attack or under constant domestic authoritative scrutiny, is still tyranny. Liberty requires security without intrusion, security plus privacy. Widespread police surveillance is the very definition of a police state. And that's why we should champion privacy even when we have nothing to hide.</p>

	    <p>Not email, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/nyregion/mailbox-theft-fishing.html">paper mail</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thieves, often at night, use string to lower glue-covered rodent traps or bottles coated with an adhesive down the chute of a sidewalk mailbox. This bait attaches to the envelopes inside, and the fish in this case -- mail containing gift cards, money orders or checks, which can be altered with chemicals and cashed -- are reeled out slowly.</p></blockquote>

<p>In response, the US Post Office is introducing a more secure mailbox:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mail slots are only large enough for letters, meaning sending even small packages will require a trip to the post office. The opening is also equipped with a mechanism that grabs at a letter once inserted, making it difficult to retract.</p></blockquote>

<p>The crime has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/nyregion/new-york-ny-mailbox-theft.html">more common</a> in the past few years.</p>

	    <p>I've <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/05/mail_cover.html">previously written</a> about mail cover -- the practice of recording the data on mail envelopes. Sai has been <a href="http://s.ai/foia#smc">covering the issue</a> in more detail, and recently received an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzmetJxi-p0VOExOZGo2V1ktWHM/view">unredacted copy</a> of a 2014 audit report. The <i>New York Times</i> has an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/us/copy-of-postal-service-audit-shows-extent-of-mail-surveillance.html">article</a> on it:</p>

<blockquote><p>In addition to raising privacy concerns, the audit questioned the Postal Service's efficiency and accuracy in handling mail cover requests. Many requests were processed late, the audit said, which delayed surveillance, and computer errors caused the same tracking number to be assigned to different requests.

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The inspector general also found that the Postal Inspection Service did not have "sufficient controls" in place to ensure that its employees followed the agency's policies in handling the national security mail covers.</p>

<p>According to the audit, about 10 percent of requests did not include the dates for the period covered by surveillance. Without the dates in the files, auditors were unable to determine if the Postal Service had followed procedures for allowing law enforcement agencies to monitor mail for a specific period of time.</p>

<p>Additionally, 15 percent of the inspectors who handled the mail covers did not have the proper nondisclosure agreements on file for handling classified materials, records that must be maintained for 50 years. The agreements would prohibit the postal workers from discussing classified information.</p>

<p>And the inspector general found that in about 32 percent of cases, postal inspectors did not include, as required, the date on which they visited facilities where mail covers were being processed. In another 32 percent of cases, law enforcement agencies did not return documents to the Postal Inspection Service's Office of Counsel, which handles the national security mail covers, within the prescribed 60 days after a case was closed.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>This is an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/how-microsoft-found-a-huawei-driver-that-opened-systems-up-to-attack/">interesting story</a> of a serious vulnerability in a Huawei driver that Microsoft found. The vulnerability is similar in style to the NSA's DOUBLEPULSAR that was leaked by the Shadow Brokers -- believed to be the Russian government -- and it's obvious that this attack copied that technique.</p>

<p>What is less clear is whether the vulnerability -- which has been fixed -- was put into the Huwei driver accidentally or on purpose.</p>

	    <p>Researchers have found a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zmakk3/researchers-find-critical-backdoor-in-swiss-online-voting-system"> critical flaw</a> in the Swiss Internet voting system. I was going to write an essay about how this demonstrates that Internet voting is a stupid idea and should never be attempted -- and that this system in particular should never be deployed, even if the found flaw is fixed -- but Cory Doctorow <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/03/13/principal-agent-problems.html">beat me to it</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The belief that companies can be trusted with this power defies all logic, but it persists. Someone found Swiss Post's embrace of the idea too odious to bear, and they leaked the source code that Swiss Post had shared under its nondisclosure terms, and then an international team of some of the world's top security experts (including some of our favorites, like <a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22matthew%20green%22">Matthew Green</a>) set about analyzing that code, and (as every security expert who doesn't work for an e-voting company has predicted since the beginning of time), they found an incredibly powerful bug that would allow a single untrusted party at Swiss Post to undetectably alter the election results.

<p>And, as everyone who's ever advocated for the right of security researchers to speak in public without permission from the companies whose products they were assessing has predicted since the beginning of time, Swiss Post and Scytl downplayed the importance of this objectively very, very, very important bug. Swiss Post's position is that since the bug only allows elections to be stolen by Swiss Post employees, it's not a big deal, because Swiss Post employees wouldn't steal an election.</p>

<p>But when Swiss Post agreed to run the election, they promised an e-voting system based on "zero knowledge" proofs that would allow voters to trust the outcome of the election <i>without</i> having to trust Swiss Post. Swiss Post is now moving the goalposts, saying that it wouldn't be such a big deal if you had to trust Swiss Post implicitly to trust the outcome of the election.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, "Well, what <i>is</i> the big deal? If you don't trust the people administering an election, you can't trust the election's outcome, right?" Not really: we design election systems so that multiple, uncoordinated people all act as checks and balances on each other. To suborn a well-run election takes massive coordination at many polling- and counting-places, as well as independent scrutineers from different political parties, as well as outside observers, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Read the whole thing. It's excellent.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011932"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/01/japanese_govern.html">Japanese Government Will Hack Citizens' IoT Devices</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The Japanese government is going to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/japanese-government-plans-to-hack-into-citizens-iot-devices/">run penetration tests</a> against all the IoT devices in their country, in an effort to (1) figure out what's insecure, and (2) help consumers secure them:</p>

<blockquote><p>The survey is scheduled to kick off next month, when authorities plan to test the password security of over 200 million IoT devices, beginning with routers and web cameras. Devices in people's homes and on enterprise networks will be tested alike.

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The Japanese government's decision to log into users' IoT devices has sparked outrage in Japan. Many have argued that this is an unnecessary step, as the same results could be achieved by just sending a security alert to all users, as there's no guarantee that the users found to be using default or easy-to-guess passwords would change their passwords after being notified in private.</p>

<p>However, the government's plan has its technical merits. Many of today's IoT and router botnets are being built by hackers who take over devices with default or easy-to-guess passwords.</p>

<p>Hackers can also build botnets with the help of exploits and vulnerabilities in router firmware, but the easiest way to assemble a botnet is by collecting the ones that users have failed to secure with custom passwords.</p>

<p>Securing these devices is often a pain, as some expose Telnet or SSH ports online without the users' knowledge, and for which very few users know how to change passwords. Further, other devices also come with secret backdoor accounts that in some cases can't be removed without a firmware update. </p></blockquote>

<p>I am interested in the results of this survey. Japan isn't very different from other industrialized nations in this regard, so their findings will be general. I am less optimistic about the country's ability to secure all of this stuff -- especially before the 2020 Summer Olympics. </p>

	    <p>Last week, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2019/01/evaluating_the_gchq_.html">evaluated the security</a> of a recent <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">GCHQ backdoor</a> proposal for communications systems. Furthering the debate, Nate Cardozo and Seth Schoen of EFF <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/detecting-ghosts-reverse-engineering-who-ya-gonna-call">explain</a> how this sort of backdoor can be detected:</p>

<blockquote><p>In fact, we think when the ghost feature is activeÂ­ -- silently inserting a secret eavesdropping member into an otherwise end-to-end encrypted conversation in the manner described by the GCHQ authorsÂ­ -- it could be detected (by the target as well as certain third parties) with at least four different techniques: binary reverse engineering, cryptographic side channels, network-traffic analysis, and crash log analysis. Further, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1082054696683085825">crash log analysis</a> could lead unrelated third parties to find evidence of the ghost in use, and it's even possible that binary reverse engineering could lead researchers to find ways to disable the ghost capability on the client side. It should be obvious that none of these possibilities are desirable for law enforcement or society as a whole. And while we've theorized some types of mitigations that might make the ghost less detectable by particular techniques, they could also impose considerable costs to the network when deployed at the necessary scale, as well as creating new potential security risks or detection methods.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other critiques of the system were written by <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">Susan Landau</a> and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">Matthew Green</a>.</p>

	    <p>The so-called Crypto Wars have been going on <a href="https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3407-doomed-to-repeat-history-lessons-from-the-crypto-wars-of-the-1990s/Crypto%20Wars_ReDo.7cb491837ac541709797bdf868d37f52.pdf">for 25 years</a> now. Basically, the FBI -- and some of their peer agencies in the UK, Australia, and elsewhere -- <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">argue</a> that the pervasive use of civilian encryption is hampering their ability to solve crimes and that they need the tech companies to make their systems susceptible to government eavesdropping. Sometimes their complaint is about communications systems, like voice or messaging apps. Sometimes it's about end-user devices. On the other side of this debate is pretty much all technologists working in computer security and cryptography, who <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">argue</a> that adding eavesdropping features fundamentally makes those systems less secure.</p>

<p>A recent entry in this debate is a <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">proposal</a> by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson, both from the UK's GCHQ (the British signals-intelligence agency -- basically, its NSA). It's actually a positive contribution to the discourse around backdoors; most of the time government officials broadly demand that the tech companies <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rod-rosenstein-encryption-backdoor/">figure out a way</a> to meet their requirements, without providing any details. Levy and Robinson write:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a world of encrypted services, a potential solution could be to go back a few decades. It's relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call. The service provider usually controls the identity system and so really decides who's who and which devices are involved -- they're usually involved in introducing the parties to a chat or call. You end up with everything still being end-to-end encrypted, but there's an extra 'end' on this particular communication. This sort of solution seems to be no more intrusive than the virtual crocodile clips that our democratically elected representatives and judiciary authorise today in traditional voice intercept solutions and certainly doesn't give any government power they shouldn't have.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the surface, this isn't a big ask. It doesn't affect the encryption that protects the communications. It only affects the authentication that assures people of whom they are talking to. But it's no less dangerous a backdoor than any others that have been proposed: It exploits a security vulnerability rather than fixing it, and it opens all users of the system to exploitation of that same vulnerability by others.</p>

<p>In a blog post, cryptographer Matthew Green <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">summarized</a> the technical problems with this GCHQ proposal. Basically, making this backdoor work requires not only changing the cloud computers that oversee communications, but it also means changing the client program on everyone's phone and computer. And that change makes all of those systems less secure. Levy and Robinson make a big deal of the fact that their backdoor would only be targeted against specific individuals and their communications, but it's still a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/62114/give-ghost-backdoor/">general backdoor</a> that <em>could</em> be used against anybody.</p>

<p>The basic problem is that a backdoor is a technical capability -- a vulnerability -- that is available to anyone who knows about it and has access to it. Surrounding that vulnerability is a procedural system that tries to limit access to that capability. Computers, especially internet-connected computers, are inherently hackable, limiting the effectiveness of any procedures. The best defense is to not have the vulnerability at all.</p>

<p>That old physical eavesdropping system Levy and Robinson allude to also exploits a security vulnerability. Because telephone conversations were unencrypted as they passed through the physical wires of the phone system, the police were able to go to a switch in a phone company facility or a junction box on the street and manually attach alligator clips to a specific pair and listen in to what that phone transmitted and received. It was a vulnerability that anyone could exploit -- not just the police -- but was mitigated by the fact that the phone company was a monolithic monopoly, and physical access to the wires was either difficult (inside a phone company building) or obvious (on the street at a junction box).</p>

<p>The functional equivalent of physical eavesdropping for modern computer phone switches is a requirement of a 1994 U.S. law called CALEA -- and similar laws in other countries. By law, telephone companies must engineer phone switches that the government can eavesdrop, mirroring that old physical system with computers. It is not the same thing, though. It doesn't have those same physical limitations that make it more secure. It can be administered remotely. And it's implemented by a computer, which makes it vulnerable to the same hacking that every other computer is vulnerable to.</p>

<p>This isn't a theoretical problem; these systems have been subverted. The most <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair">public incident</a> dates from 2004 in Greece. Vodafone Greece had phone switches with the eavesdropping feature mandated by CALEA. It was turned off by default in the Greek phone system, but the NSA managed to surreptitiously <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/">turn it on</a> and use it to eavesdrop on the Greek prime minister and over 100 other high-ranking dignitaries.</p>

<p>There's nothing distinct about a phone switch that makes it any different from other modern encrypted voice or chat systems; any remotely administered backdoor system will be just as vulnerable. Imagine a chat program added this GCHQ backdoor. It would have to add a feature that added additional parties to a chat from somewhere in the system -- and not by the people at the endpoints. It would have to suppress any messages alerting users to another party being added to that chat. Since some chat programs, like iMessage and Signal, automatically send such messages, it would force those systems to lie to their users. Other systems would simply never implement the "tell me who is in this chat conversation" featureÂ­which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>And once that's in place, every government will try to hack it for its own purposesÂ­ -- just as the NSA hacked Vodafone Greece. Again, this is nothing new. In 2010, China successfully hacked the back-door mechanism Google <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/china-google-attack-part-widespread-spying-effort-28293/">put in place</a> to meet law-enforcement requests. In 2015, someone -- we don't know who -- <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232227-where-did-i-leave-my-keys/abstract">hacked an NSA backdoor</a> in a random-number generator used to create encryption keys, changing the parameters so they could also eavesdrop on the communications. There are certainly other stories that haven't been made public.</p>

<p>Simply adding the feature erodes public trust. If you were a dissident in a totalitarian country trying to communicate securely, would you want to use a voice or messaging system that is known to have this sort of backdoor? Who would you bet on, especially when the cost of losing the bet might be imprisonment or worse: the company that runs the system, or your country's government intelligence agency? If you were a senior government official, or the head of a large multinational corporation, or the security manager or a critical technician at a power plant, would you want to use this system?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Two years ago, there was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-design-feature-encrypted-messages">rumor</a> of a WhatsApp backdoor. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/flawed-reporting-about-whatsapp">details</a> are <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">complicated</a>, and calling it a backdoor or a vulnerability <a href="https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/">is</a> <a href="http://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687">largely</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5nq201/whatsapp_backdoor_allows_snooping_on_encrypted/dce86wa/?st=jpfg671x&amp;sh=482f0949">inaccurate</a> -- but the resultant confusion caused some people to abandon the encrypted messaging service.</p>

<p>Trust is fragile, and <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/pjcis-2018/">transparency</a> is essential to trust. And while Levy and Robinson state that "any exceptional access solution should not fundamentally change the trust relationship between a service provider and its users," this proposal does exactly that. Communications companies could no longer be honest about what their systems were doing, and we would have no reason to trust them if they tried.</p>

<p>In the end, all of these exceptional access mechanisms, whether they exploit existing vulnerabilities that should be closed or force vendors to open new ones, reduce the security of the underlying system. They reduce our reliance on security technologies we know how to do well -- cryptography -- to computer security technologies we are much less good at. Even worse, they replace technical security measures with organizational procedures. Whether it's a database of master keys that could decrypt an iPhone or a communications switch that orchestrates who is securely chatting with whom, it is vulnerable to attack. And it will be attacked.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion is a specific example of a broader discussion that we need to have, and it's about the attack/defense balance. Which should we prioritize? Should we design our systems to be open to attack, in which case they can be exploited by law enforcement -- and others? Or should we design our systems to be as secure as possible, which means they will be better protected from hackers, criminals, foreign governments and -- unavoidably -- law enforcement as well?</p>

<p>This discussion is larger than the FBI's ability to solve crimes or the NSA's ability to spy. We know that foreign intelligence services are targeting the communications of our elected officials, our power infrastructure, and our voting systems. Do we really want some foreign country penetrating our lawful-access backdoor in the same way the NSA penetrated Greece's?</p>

<p>I have long maintained that we need to adopt a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/AC_StrategyPapers_No8_Saving_Cyberspace_WEB.pdf">defense-dominant strategy</a>: We should prioritize our need for security over our need for surveillance. This is especially true in the new world of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">physically capable computers</a>. Yes, it will mean that law enforcement will have a harder time eavesdropping on communications and unlocking computing devices. But law enforcement has <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">other forensic techniques</a> to collect surveillance data in our highly networked world. We'd be much better off <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20160301/104573/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-LandauS-20160301.pdf">increasing law enforcement's technical ability</a> to investigate crimes in the <a href="https://cdt.org/blog/%E2%80%98going-dark%E2%80%99-versus-a-%E2%80%98golden-age-for-surveillance%E2%80%99/">modern digital world</a> than we would be to weaken security for everyone. The ability to surreptitiously add ghost users to a conversation is a vulnerability, and it's one that we would be better served by closing than exploiting.</p>

	    <p>Impressive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/nyregion/el-chapo-trial.html">police work</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a daring move that placed his life in danger, the I.T. consultant eventually gave the F.B.I. his system's secret encryption keys in 2011 after he had moved the network's servers from Canada to the Netherlands during what he told the cartel's leaders was a routine upgrade.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Dutch article <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nederlandse-politie-tapte-anderhalf-jaar-lang-alle-communicatie-van-mexicaanse-drugsbaron-el-chapo-~bab33a30/">says</a> that it's a BlackBerry system.</p>

<p>El Chapo had his IT person install "...spyware called FlexiSPY on the 'special phones' he had given to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, as well as to two of his lovers, including one who was a former Mexican lawmaker." That same software was used by the FBI when his IT person turned over the keys. Yet again we learn the lesson that a backdoor can be used against you.</p>

<p>And it doesn't have to be with the IT person's permission. A good intelligence agency can use the IT person's authorizations without his knowledge or consent. This is why the NSA <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/03/20/inside-nsa-secret-efforts-hunt-hack-system-administrators/">hunts sysadmins</a>.</p>

	    <p>Back in October, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies">reported</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom">that</a> China has managed to install backdoors into server equipment that ended up in networks belonging to -- among others -- Apple and Amazon. Pretty much everybody has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-amazon-apple-supermicro-and-beijing-respond">denied</a> it (including the US <a href="https://gizmodo.com/homeland-security-denies-report-that-chinese-spies-put-1829585079">DHS</a> and the UK <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-britain/uk-cyber-security-agency-backs-apple-amazon-china-hack-denials-idUSKCN1MF1DN">NCSC</a>). Bloomberg has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/bloomberg-stands-by-chinese-chip-story-as-apple-amazon-ratchet-up-denials/">stood by</a> its story -- and is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/11/27/bloomberg-is-still-reporting-on-challenged-story-regarding-china-hardware-hack/">still standing</a> by it.</p>

<p>I don't think it's real. Yes, it's plausible. But first of all, if someone actually surreptitiously put malicious chips onto motherboards en masse, we would have seen a photo of the alleged chip already. And second, there are easier, more effective, and less obvious ways of adding backdoors to networking equipment.</p>

	    <p>Some of us -- myself included -- have proposed lawful government hacking as an alternative to backdoors. A new report from the Center of Internet and Society looks at <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/2018.09.04_Security_Risks_of_Government_Hacking_Whitepaper.pdf">the security risks</a> of allowing government hacking. They include:</p>

<ul><li>Disincentive for vulnerability disclosure
<li>Cultivation of a market for surveillance tools
<li>Attackers co-opt hacking tools over which governments have lost control
<li>Attackers learn of vulnerabilities through government use of malware
<li>Government incentives to push for less-secure software and standards
<li>Government malware affects innocent users.</ul>

<p>These risks are real, but I think they're much less than mandating backdoors for everyone. From the report's conclusion:</p>

<blockquote><p>Government hacking is often lauded as a solution to the "going dark" problem. It is too dangerous to mandate encryption backdoors, but targeted hacking of endpoints could ensure investigators access to same or similar necessary data with less risk. Vulnerabilities will never affect everyone, contingent as they are on software, network configuration, and patch management. Backdoors, however, mean everybody is vulnerable and a security failure fails catastrophically. In addition, backdoors are often secret, while eventually, vulnerabilities will typically be disclosed and patched.</p></blockquote>

<p>The key to minimizing the risks is to ensure that law enforcement (or whoever) report all vulnerabilities discovered through the normal process, and use them for lawful hacking during the period between reporting and patching. Yes, that's a big ask, but the alternatives are worse.</p>

	    <p>In today's world of ubiquitous computers and networks, it's hard to overstate the value of encryption. Quite simply, encryption keeps you safe. Encryption protects your financial details and passwords when you bank online. It protects your cell phone conversations from eavesdroppers. If you encrypt your laptop â and I hope you do â it protects your data if your computer is stolen. It protects your money and your privacy.</p>
<p>Encryption protects the identity of dissidents all over the world. It's a vital tool to allow journalists to communicate securely with their sources, NGOs to protect their work in repressive countries, and attorneys to communicate privately with their clients.</p>
<p>Encryption protects our government. It protects our government systems, our lawmakers, and our law enforcement officers. Encryption protects our officials working at home and abroad. During the whole Apple vs. FBI debate, I wondered if Director James Comey realized how many of his own agents used iPhones and relied on Apple's security features to protect them.</p>
<p>Encryption protects our critical infrastructure: our communications network, the national power grid, our transportation infrastructure, and everything else we rely on in our society. And as we move to the Internet of Things with its interconnected cars and thermostats and medical devices, all of which can destroy life and property if hacked and misused, encryption will become even more critical to our personal and national security.</p>
<p>Security is more than encryption, of course. But encryption is a critical component of security. While it's mostly invisible, you use strong encryption every day, and our Internet-laced world would be a far riskier place if you did not.</p>
<p>When it's done right, strong encryption is unbreakable encryption. Any weakness in encryption will be exploited â by hackers, criminals, and foreign governments. Many of the hacks that make the news can be attributed to weak or â even worse â nonexistent encryption.</p>
<p>The FBI wants the ability to bypass encryption in the course of criminal investigations. This is known as a "backdoor," because it's a way to access the encrypted information that bypasses the normal encryption mechanisms. I am sympathetic to such claims, but as a technologist I can tell you that there is no way to give the FBI that capability without weakening the encryption against all adversaries as well. This is critical to understand. I can't build an access technology that only works with proper legal authorization, or only for people with a particular citizenship or the proper morality. The technology just doesn't work that way.</p>
<p>If a backdoor exists, then anyone can exploit it. All it takes is knowledge of the backdoor and the capability to exploit it. And while it might temporarily be a secret, it's a fragile secret. Backdoors are one of the primary ways to attack computer systems.</p>
<p>This means that if the FBI can eavesdrop on your conversations or get into your computers without your consent, so can the Chinese. Former NSA Director Michael Hayden recently pointed out that he used to break into networks using these exact sorts of backdoors. Backdoors weaken us against all sorts of threats.</p>
<p>Even a highly sophisticated backdoor that could only be exploited by nations like the U.S. and China today will leave us vulnerable to cybercriminals tomorrow. That's just the way technology works: things become easier, cheaper, more widely accessible. Give the FBI the ability to hack into a cell phone today, and tomorrow you'll hear reports that a criminal group used that same ability to hack into our power grid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the bad guys will move to one of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/02/worldwide_encry.html">546 foreign-made encryption products</a>, safely out of the reach of any U.S. law.</p>
<p>Either we build encryption systems to keep everyone secure, or we build them to leave everybody vulnerable.</p>
<p>The FBI paints this as a trade-off between security and privacy. It's not. It's a trade-off between more security and less security. Our national security needs strong encryption. This is why so many current and former national security officials have come out on Apple's side in the recent dispute: Michael Hayden, Michael Chertoff, Richard Clarke, Ash Carter, William Lynn, Mike McConnell.</p>
<p>I wish it were possible to give the good guys the access they want without also giving the bad guys access, but it isn't. If the FBI gets its way and forces companies to weaken encryption, all of us â our data, our networks, our infrastructure, our society â will be at risk.</p>
<p>The FBI isn't going dark. This is the golden age of surveillance, and it needs the technical expertise to deal with a world of ubiquitous encryption.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to weaken encryption for all needs to look beyond one particular law-enforcement tool to our infrastructure as a whole. When you do, it's obvious that security must trump surveillance â otherwise we all lose.</p>

	<h2 class="entry" id="a011998">Malware Installed in Asus Computers through Hacked Update Process</h2>
	
	
		
	
    
	    <p>Kaspersky Labs is <a href="https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/">reporting</a> on a new supply chain attack they call "Shadowhammer."</p>

<blockquote><p>In January 2019, we discovered a sophisticated supply chain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility. The attack took place between June and November 2018 and according to our telemetry, it affected a large number of users. 

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, which were identified by their network adapters' MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses in the trojanized samples and this list was used to identify the actual intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique MAC addresses from over 200 samples used in this attack. Of course, there might be other samples out there with different MAC addresses in their list.</p>

<p>We believe this to be a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses <a href="https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/">the Shadowpad</a> and the <a href="https://blog.avast.com/update-to-the-ccleaner-5.33.6162-security-incident">CCleaner</a> incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed with legitimate certificates (eg: "ASUSTeK Computer Inc."). The malicious updaters were hosted on the official liveupdate01s.asus[.]com and liveupdate01.asus[.]com ASUS update servers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sophistication of the attack leads to the speculation that a nation-state -- and one of the cyber powers -- is responsible.</p>

<p>As I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/05/supply-chain_se.html">previously written</a>, supply chain security is "an incredibly complex problem." These attacks co-opt the very mechanisms we need to trust for our security. And the international nature of our industry results in an array of vulnerabilities that are very hard to secure.</p>

<p>Kim Zetter has a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers">really good article</a> on this.

<p>There are at least 2 groups interested in grabbing access to products going into mass market</p>

<p>1. Security Services  -  These are unstoppable.  See NSA repacking a Cisco Router.</p>

<p>2. Other folks for a lot of reasons - Money, Trolling, Notoriety and Pawnage.  See Lion King CD Distro when original CDs contained XXX content inserted during the CD Stamping Process.</p>

<p>Attacking supply systems is a long standing military objective. It's a very refined attack system and JIT made it super easy to do.</p>

<p>Trying to explain to people that just because it says XXX or the LED is green or it is in shrink wrap does not mean it really is XXX or the system is not failing or it's not been rewrapped, this doesn't seem to connect the dots for them.</p>

<p>While this concerns technology attacks, the same goes for consumer goods and foods.  Faked Virgin Olive Oil, prohibited products in foods, mislabeled items, rewrapped meats.  It's old hat and well known.</p>

<p>For every bar we place to prevent redirection, it is only as good as the implementation.  The system that permits an Updater to update malware or badware or crapware is useful for Group 1.  They do it regularly.  They are not going to allow the necessary changes.  Or at least not until a whole lot of folks refuse Dragonfly work projects and the companies that profit from them.<br />

<p>This is a point that neads further investigation / explanation,</p>

<p>"'The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed with legitimate certificates (eg: "ASUSTeK Computer Inc.").'"</p>

<p>The use was most unlikely to have been 'legitimate' which implies one of three things,</p>

<p>1, Private Key was stolen.<br />
2, Private Key was remade.<br />
3, Some form of collision was found.</p>

<p>Whilst nearly anybody can do the first because the technical skills are well known and fairly easily aquired, the last two are potentially restricted to just a handfull or two at the most of organisations in the world.</p>

<p>Of those you are looking at the SigInt agencies with not just the brains but also the computing resources to carry them out.</p>

<p>Also this is in many ways an apparent replay of stuxnet, with very few actual targets in it's scope (which also would have helped keep it covert).</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see the 600 numbers and use a service like Shodan etc to track them down to networks thus potentialy identify the targets. Then work backwards to identify the attackers. </p>

<p>@ALL:</p>

<p>Just one thing to remember MAC addresses are not always easy to get or associate with an individual.</p>

<p>One good way to do it is when the person crosses a boarder and the laptop is turned on to see it's not a bomb etc...</p>

<p>Thus a small bet is all the targets have traveled to only one or two countries collectively.</p>

<p>But for others, for goodness sake do not take your main laptop phone etc abroad with you, it's an APT risk to far for any sensible person to do these days.</p>

<p>It is a certain bet that at a number of boarders all your electronics are enumerated in many ways and they are all then stored away against the Identity in your travel documents along with your picture, finger print etc and no doubt in some cases your DNA and other fingerprints from the VIP / frequent flier lounge etc.</p>

<p>Yes it might sound a little paranoid today, but think of your tommorows. We've been through the same with 'collect it all' where you were paranoid before Ed Snowden and had good insight or insider knowledge afterwards. Be very clear they are out to get us all because like those collecting PII for advertising the information has value. Yours might be worthless today but will it always be? Likewise the person standing next to you in the airport que their DNA etc might be of value beyond price, thus overall the average cost of collecting everybodies DNA fingerprints and images is easily worth the minor price per individual, and it will only get less costly with time.</p>

<p>A couple of things I've seen missing from most reporting on this: </p>

<p>1) Asus needs to revoke those certs (Zetter at least mentioned this), and rethink how it protects them in future, if they're serious.  Everything else is just window dressing if they don't get that part right; and</p>

<p>2) Has anyone wondered whether Asus was complicit?  </p>

</p>
<p>One of the reasons this happened and for so long is that the current code signing peocess is broken.</p>

<p>A search of this blog shows that the failings of code signing has been mentioned for a decade or more, and two names saying it's not a good idea and why show up regularly, @Nick P and @Clive Robinson.</p>

<p>So to add to those comments,</p>

<p>In this case the failure is the "Upload and forget" behaviour of the organisation concerned. That is they can not have had a policy of actually checking the files after they were uploaded to ensure they had not been changed at any point in time in a timely manner.</p>

<p>After the warning of stuxnet not doing this sort of checking realy is negligent behaviour.</p>

<p>There are several fairly easy ways such 'image checking' can be done, but it would be wise these days to do a byte by byte comparison and not rely on hashes, as the likes of the NSA and GCHQ might have broken them.</p>

<p>In essence a copy of the files in genuine Read Only Format needs to be put on an effectively hidden computer. It either pulls the files on the public server down to check them every half hour or so. Or it's a little more sophisticated and checks the files 'off the wire' as users download them. Either way the malware substitute would have been caught very very quickly.</p>

<p>Whilst that will not solve the other issues identified and put up on this blog in the past, it will block this particular attack in future.</p>

<p>However it needs to be said that their have been other attacks developed by the GCHQ and the NSA that could achive the same result. That is the 'get in quick' attack where the first TCP packet that arives at the destination machine is accepted. Thus if the SigInt agencies can have the files distributed around the net they can get their malware loded packets to a users computer first.</p>

<p>As easy as this sounds, it's actually going to be quite hard to implement with COST systems. But that does not in any way suggest they do not have the capabilities to do it.</p>

<p><i>The malware had 600 unique MAC addresses it was seeking</i></p>

<p>If the malware looks for specific machine, characterised by a MAC for each adapter (Ethernet and a WiFi), then only 300 machines are really concerned.</p>

<p>How did the attacker select the MAC addresses? By running malware on the ASUS update server, and finding out who came to the watering hole that met the criteria? I found no mention of the common denominator linking the machines. A country? A company? Did AG Barr bowdlerize the report? [SNCR] A fuller picture might help Kaspersky reestablish its reputation.</p>

<p><i>Buried in those malicious samples were hard-coded MD5 hash values that turned out to be unique MAC addresses for network adapter cards. </i></p>

<p>OK, now we know that the malware was written by a 100â¬ rent-a-coder. :-)</p>

<p>What's not clear to me what exactly needs to be updated directly by ASUS. The machines would usually call home to Redmond for OS updating, but a BIOS upgrade would normally be initiated manually by the user. Stuff like video drivers would be delivered over the Microsoft channel, and not the OEM, isn't it?</p>

<p>The thing that concerns me is:</p>

<blockquote>
Kamluk said Kaspersky notified ASUS of the problem on January 31, and a Kaspersky employee met with ASUS in person on February 14. But he said the company has been largely unresponsive since then and has not notified ASUS customers about the issue.

<p>Hey, I get that it's hard to get this stuff right, and an oopsie can happen, but the real test is whether a company does the right thing once the oopsie is pointed out or not. </p>

<p>@nobody: Good question.  Apparently the malware was based on a modified version of a several-year-old legimate ASUS file, pointing towards attackers who were able to compromise Asus's signing and distribution infrastructure but not their code building/deploying infrastructure.  Had Asus (or individuals within it) been complicit, they likely (but who really knows) would have injected the malware as a software build dependency, not post-build at the signing stage.</p>

<p>Ohhhh.. question answered. I didn't realize Asus were Taiwanese. This is obviously some sort of Red Chinese operation against the Taiwanese, who might buy Asus hardware even for serious use for purely patriotic reasons.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with that, but hope they require the company to fix their security issues in future.</p>

</p>
<p>Mixed thoughts:<br />
1- If some state agency wants to know more about 600 MAC addresses this is none of our business and anyway if they really want them nothing can prevent it. And, if they're doing their homework properly(and why are we doubting it?) then it is a good thing that those MACs are taken care of.<br />
2- Have the MACs been published? Are they single MACs or across a range?<br />
3- Certificates give a false sense of security<br />
4- From an entrepreneur POV, I like spies to spy. It's their job. If they are doing their job, well that is great. </p>

</p>
<p>@65535:</p>

<p>The Microsoft court submission is well worth reading as it actually gives a nice description of how the Barium persons go about their activities.</p>

<p>Interestingly is the use of a 'headless C&C' technique (see paragraph 29 onwards) using blogs etc that was first publicaly described in almost exactly the same way on this blog some years ago now. So one or more of the Barium individuals might well be readers of this blog.</p>

<p>In which case 'Hi guys, how are your collars feeling a little hot and tight?'</p>

<p>Microsoft appear to believe that the targets for their activities are mainly in the Virginia area. Also one of the code break downs of the malware indicates that if the language on the computer is either Russian or Chinese it stops dead at that simple first check.</p>

<p>But Microsoft either don't know the warm body names of the two people they think they have found behind Barium or they are being a little cautious. </p>

<p>That said in other unrelated cases Brian Krebs has not just found warm bodies on less info in the past, he's actually found their real phone numbers and called them, so it's likely these Barium guys are as tracable with a little bit of investigation. That is unless their OpSec has been better than professional.</p>

<p>Anyway it's 'turning in time' the brain is getting tired I'll have a further look over things when I get up to greet the cold light of day ;-)</p>

<p>@wumpus:</p>

<p>"There's a whole long chain of trust here, and plenty of them are pretty weak. Don't assume that a collision was made when rubber hose cryptography would work much easier (or more likely social engineering)."</p>

<p>In the general case I'd agree with you.</p>

<p>But in this case some are claiming a million users were effected all over the globe, I can not see how they were socialy engineered in this case.</p>

<p>However yes people at the development end could have been hoodwinked or coerced in various ways to hand over either the private key or access to it. But I kind of see that as 'part and parcel' of the trade of theft / stealing. Frequently insiders are turned by blackmail or having members of their family threatened in various ways, along with 'doing a friend a favour' or being 'given a drink'.</p>

<p>The smarter criminals learned long ago --unlike many others-- that as a method of obtaining information, goods, or services, physical tourture of an individual was not as successfull and far riskier than threatening to do it to somebodies loved one. That is you make the individuals mind turn on themselves through their imagination. Essentially it's how the protection racket works, actually hurting people is reserved for those who either lack imagination or for some reason don't care and of these about one in six are likely to repay the favor ten or twenty fold which is one of the ways in which we end up with street gang warfare and injured bystanders. Which is bad for business which is why the smarter criminals tend to be more wary of using violence than others, and when they do, they tend not to leave those who might seek revenge behind. Which is why there are actually gangland 'hit men' / 'mechanics' actively employed, the less smart of whom tend to get caught. As has been pointed out killing people is easy but stupid unless you have meticulously pland how to stop enquires by the authorities or those left behind being made.</p>

<p>Similar issues arise with recruiting and using insiders as the Greek Phone Tapping scandle made clear.</p>

<p>I wonder if it might be desirable to establish a number of trusted platforms for hosting the hashes of software updates so that software update tools can download the hash from a number of platforms and ensure they all agree as well as agreeing with the actual update.</p>

<p>This would substantially reduce the risk of undetected software update attacks since it would force the malicious code to be contained in all versions of the update increasing the chances that security researchers would discover it.</p>

<p>@Tatutata (give or take an umlaut)</p>

<p>"How did the attacker select the MAC addresses? By running malware on the ASUS update server, and finding out who came to the watering hole that met the criteria?"</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>MAC addresses don't generally propagate over IP; the Asus update server doesn't see the visitor's MAC address. </p>

<p>Broadly speaking, you need to have hands on the machine whose MAC address you want, or be able to connect to it over ethernet (MAC addresses are used exclusively in the ethernet protocol). At risk of pointing out the obvious, ethernet is a LAN protocol. So you can't just hoover up the MAC addresses of all those visiting your website.</p>

<p>So whoever targeted those MACs had either laid hands on the corresponding PCs (e.g. border agents); or they had local access to the PC in question (perhaps via some kind of trojan or 'implant'); or they had local (or equivalent) access to another machine on the same LAN (perhaps by infiltrating that LAN).</p>

<p> </p>

</p>
<p>To be clear: my supposition is that the MACs were collected from a single LAN, or perhaps a group of related LANs, by an intruder. I would like to know what the investigators know about the MAC addresses in question; there is no comment on this from the authors or from Kaspersky.</p>

<p>If the MACs represent a commercial or government entity, then there is a good chance that the network adapters were made by the same manufacturer - with the result that the default MAC address of many of those adapters will share the same prefix.</p>

<p>Have the owners of these LANs been notified? Or even identified?</p>

<p>I suspect that quite a lot of information about this story has been kept under wraps.</p>

<p>@Denton Scratch @TatÃ¼tata:</p>

<p>"So whoever targeted those MACs had either laid hands on the corresponding PCs"</p>

<p>There are potentially another ways.</p>

<p>You could also get them from hotels and confrences etc where your target 'uses the WiFi', it's not exactly difficult to turn an Android Mobile Phone into a WiFi sniffer. You could also just act as an AP with an Android phone without any modification so you could just walk up and sit at the same table with your phone in your top pocket...</p>

<p>Also there are less obvious ways favoured by various ICs so either 'hands on' in the supply chain or 'access to records' from the supply chain may well work.</p>

<p>Because MACs are --allegedly-- unique, they do get used from time to time as 'serial numbers' in software and the like (stupid I know but then anything to save 0.01cents in FMCE design).</p>

<p>But geting access to corporate LANs may not be as difficult as it sounds. Remember those Russia's that got the order of the boot for activities incompatible with diplomatic behaviour?</p>

<p>They were set up to go WiFi sniffing from a hotel car park to a target organisation. It's altogether possible there has been a 'drive by' passive sniff of traffic from a commercial site and the WiFi MACs are what are in the file.</p>

<p>The thing that a lot of people either do not know or have forgotton is MACs are like ISBNs not only are they effectively unique, they get issued in blocks or ranges, thus the first digits are in effect a 'Manufacturers Code' and due to the way things get manufactured other digits may end up being the equivalent of a 'model number'.</p>

<p>If the MACs were obtained from a 'drive by' it's also possible that this attack against Asus is not unique and other manufactures support sites have also been attacked in the same way...</p>

I wonder if MAC spoofing would circumvent the malware, or whether it is sufficiently sophisticated   to seek out the hardcoded original MAC of the hardware. As I believe has already been mentioned,  600 is such a tiny number. It is so specific! <br />

<p>@65535:</p>

<p>"As for the Russian and the Chinese - it is always them."</p>

<p>Of course not, nor is it just the US 'Evil Axis of Four' which adds Iran and North Korea, they are all 'distant bogiemen who's faces the people will never see, and who's voices will never be heard' so convenient as 'whiping boys'. </p>

<p>Why? Because we actually know that any and every Nation State with the ability to do it 'are doing it' and even those without the native ability are 'buying it in' or in effect 'outsourcing it'. Because if they were not there would not be so many private companies making very large amounts of money from packaging up exploits and back end big data systems for them. As somebody used to point out here about the US and the 'Evil Axis,of four', 'logically it does not make sense', thus is either highly improbable or effectively in human terms impossible.</p>

<p>But if you agree or not with the further 'Orwellian 1984' premise that 'Every great state requires a distant enemy for the people to focus on' as a way to stop them 'focusing on their state and it's failings towards them'. The US administrations 'Evil Axis of four' is unquestionably a cynically motivated political driven narative, ment as a diversion from the real state of things... Such behaviour, would more properly be called propaganda, if the US Goverment was legaly alowed to use it. But supposadly they are not, so instead we could use a nu-speak name of 'Fake-News', or should it be 'Real-News' (with the unwritten tag line of 'We know it's Real because we reboil it fresh every day for you to consume').</p>

<p>As for 'keeping it under wraps' I doubt we will ever know the truth. If things can be made out to be 'A distant enemy' then indictments can be issued, Grand Juries held, and a ham sandwich can be tried in absentia, massive fines levied, and thus sactions issued. All like a well oiled machine unless like a group of Russians you instruct US lawyers to contest the indictments from day one...</p>

<p>@Rach El:</p>

<p>"I wonder if MAC spoofing would circumvent the malware, or whether it is sufficiently sophisticated to seek out the hardcoded original MAC of the hardware."</p>

<p>The reason I said 'MACs are --allegedly-- unique' is that back a long time ago with the NE2000 cheapnet ethernet card, hardware manufacturers started using 'Electricaly Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory' (EEPROM) that we now call 'Flash' memory to store the MAC in, so there is not actually a 'hardcoded original MAC' any more, which is why it's daft to use it with the likes of Radius etc as an authentication method.</p>

<p>So yes not just run time spoofing will work but with the right bit of code the Flash can be changed as well (failing that at one time a hardware 'chip clamp' and change it electrically, if the Flash is a seperate chip, which in these days of SoCs is less likely).</p>

<p>What people tend to forget in this day and age of security vunerabilities is that 'knowing a number' is not a way to authenticate. Likewise 'using a secret number' is no better when people have access to the hardware. For two reasons,</p>

<p>1, Layers of software.<br />
2, Manufacturing returns.</p>

<p>There are so many layers of software between the 'number' and the interface over which authentication happens that it's not possible to check and verify on a remote machine, because it can be programed to lie (look up 'GÃ¶del Machines').</p>

<p>The profit in 'Fast Moving Consumer Electronics' (FMCE) is quite small (to non existant with IoT). The cost of a 'return for repair' is eyewateringly expensive when compared to that of the distribution cost. Therefore anything and everything that can be done remotely across a near zero cost to transfer information network is going to be done. This in effect means 'full mutability' even in the CPU. As long as things are mutable someone is going to change then, as that is the nature of the human condition. No matter what security you put in place on the hardware, someone will work out how to get around it, again it's part of the human condition.</p>

<p>Any one who ignores those two facts is in for a rude shock as the 'Cable and Satellite set top box' manufacturers found out over and over again. </p>

<p>âI believe has already been mentioned, 600 is such a tiny number. It is so specific!â</p>

<p>Yes, I agree. That sounds like a targeted attack. Give then next postâ¦it makes me wonder.</p>

<p>âAs for 'keeping it under wraps' I doubt we will ever know the truth.â -1&1~=Umm</p>

<p>That usually takes a large amount power and machinery in the States â wilth all the leaksâ¦ Snowden and so on. But, NSLs are a powerful tool. </p>

<p>Sure, any truly well financed and focused nation or group could have done it. We will have to wait and see.<br />

<p>@65535 @Rach El:</p>

<p>"Sure, any truly well financed and focused nation or group could have done it."</p>

<p>But 'the law of the acorn' like Ocams Razor is most often a good indicator, as is the old saying about 'a dog and it's vomit' or 'criminals and the scene of the crime'.</p>

<p>So yup if I had to make a small wager, 'nation state' and one that's been caught 'red handed' tampering with not just the 'supply chain' but also 'code signing'. Which kind of indicates the US IC.</p>

<p>But it would only be a small wager, because in the hall of 'smoke and mirrors' that is 'The Great Game' play room that even Kipling noticed, like many children they also like to play 'follow my leader' and 'Simon Says' (which is also what the banks did that got us into 'Banking Crisis One' and 'Banking Crisis Two'). </p>

<p>"supply chain security is "an incredibly complex problem.""</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>It seems to me the answer is simple: Corporations need to stop using minimal security to save $$, or be held financially accountable when they don't.</p>

<p>Every time we see major corporations being hacked, there's a rush of people saying "security is hard" but when the next attack occurrs, it seems as if they've attempted nothing to abate it.</p>

<p>Questions nobody is asking:</p>

<p>1. How did hackers upload the trojan to the update server?<br />
2. WHY was the update server not made read-only on the public side?<br />
3. WHY doesn't ASUS have the ability to check any new files added to their servers with a hash table to see if it is one of their own?</p>

<p>All these corporate hacks make me think of a person who, in order to save money, decided to only put screen doors on their house instead of lock-and-key doors. Then they wonder why they keep getting robbed.</p>

<p>@:</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Simple answer, is if the NSA with one of the largest budgets in the world can not get it right, how much do you think it would cost consumers for all companies to get it right?</p>

<p>Yup economic activity as we currently know it would cease to exist and apart from security work as guard labour so would most jobs. </p>

<p>With regards,</p>

<p>"Questions nobody is asking:"</p>

<p>Some of them have been asked befor, in fact years before. I used to advise clients that web sites should where possible be static and read only or deploy a checking method as I described above,</p>

<p>"'In essence a copy of the files in genuine Read Only Format needs to be put on an effectively hidden computer. It either pulls the files on the public server down to check them every half hour or so. Or it's a little more sophisticated and checks the files 'off the wire' as users download them. Either way the malware substitute would have been caught very very quickly.'"</p>

<p>But as I noted above it does not solve all of the problems as 'State Level' attackers have shown they have other methods that site owners can do nothing about.</p>

	    <p>An <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2938033">article I co-wrote</a> -- my first law journal article -- was <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/03/06/12564.pdf">cited</a> by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court -- the state supreme court -- in a case on compelled decryption.</p>

<p>Here's the first, in footnote 1:</p>

<blockquote><p>We understand the word "password" to be synonymous with other terms that cell phone users may be familiar with, such as Personal Identification Number or "passcode." Each term refers to the personalized combination of letters or digits that, when manually entered by the user, "unlocks" a cell phone. For simplicity, we use "password" throughout. See generally, Kerr & Schneier, Encryption Workarounds, 106 Geo. L.J. 989, 990, 994, 998 (2018).</p></blockquote>

<p>And here's the second, in footnote 5:</p>

<blockquote><p>We recognize that ordinary cell phone users are likely unfamiliar with the complexities of encryption technology. For instance, although entering a password "unlocks" a cell phone, the password itself is not the "encryption key" that decrypts the cell phone's contents. See Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em> at 995. Rather, "entering the [password] decrypts the [encryption] key, enabling the key to be processed and unlocking the phone. This two-stage process is invisible to the casual user." <em>Id</em>. Because the technical details of encryption technology do not play a role in our analysis, they are not worth belaboring. Accordingly, we treat the entry of a password as effectively decrypting the contents of a cell phone. For a more detailed discussion of encryption technology, see generally Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em>.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011962"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/on_the_security_1.html">On the Security of Password Managers</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>There's <a href="https://www.securityevaluators.com/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/">new research</a> on the security of password managers, specifically 1Password, Dashlane, KeePass, and Lastpass. This work specifically looks at password leakage on the host computer. That is, does the password manager accidentally leave plaintext copies of the password lying around memory?</p>

<blockquote><p>All password managers we examined sufficiently secured user secrets while in a "not running" state. That is, if a password database were to be extracted from disk and if a strong master password was used, then brute forcing of a password manager would be computationally prohibitive.

<p>Each password manager also attempted to scrub secrets from memory. But residual buffers remained that contained secrets, most likely due to memory leaks, lost memory references, or complex GUI frameworks which do not expose internal memory management mechanisms to sanitize secrets.</p>

<p>This was most evident in 1Password7 where secrets, including the master password and its associated secret key, were present in both a locked and unlocked state. This is in contrast to 1Password4, where at most, a single entry is exposed in a "running unlocked" state and the master password exists in memory in an obfuscated form, but is easily recoverable. If 1Password4 scrubbed the master password memory region upon successful unlocking, it would comply with all proposed security guarantees we outlined earlier.</p>

<p>This paper is not meant to criticize specific password manager implementations; however, it is to establish a reasonable minimum baseline which all password managers should comply with. It is evident that attempts are made to scrub and sensitive memory in all password managers. However, each password manager fails in implementing proper secrets sanitization for various reasons.</p></blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>LastPass obfuscates the master password while users are typing in the entry, and when the password manager enters an unlocked state, database entries are only decrypted into memory when there is user interaction. However, ISE reported that these entries persist in memory after the software enters a locked state. It was also possible for the researchers to extract the master password and interacted-with password entries due to a memory leak. 

<p>KeePass scrubs the master password from memory and is not recoverable. However, errors in workflows permitted the researchers from extracting credential entries which have been interacted with. In the case of Windows APIs, sometimes, various memory buffers which contain decrypted entries may not be scrubbed correctly.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether this is a big deal or not depends on whether you consider your computer to be trusted.</p>

<p>Several people have emailed me to ask why my own <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/">Password Safe</a> was not included in the evaluation, and whether it has the same vulnerabilities. My guess about the former is that Password Safe isn't as popular as the others. (This is for two reasons: 1) I don't publicize it very much, and 2) it doesn't have an easy way to synchronize passwords across devices or otherwise store password data in the cloud.) As to the latter: we tried to code Password Safe not to leave plaintext passwords lying around in memory.</p>

<p>So, Independent Security Evaluators: take a look at <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/">Password Safe</a>.</p>

<p>Also, remember the vulnerabilities found in many cloud-based password managers <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/09/security_of_pas.html">back in 2014</a>?</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011932"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/01/japanese_govern.html">Japanese Government Will Hack Citizens' IoT Devices</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The Japanese government is going to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/japanese-government-plans-to-hack-into-citizens-iot-devices/">run penetration tests</a> against all the IoT devices in their country, in an effort to (1) figure out what's insecure, and (2) help consumers secure them:</p>

<blockquote><p>The survey is scheduled to kick off next month, when authorities plan to test the password security of over 200 million IoT devices, beginning with routers and web cameras. Devices in people's homes and on enterprise networks will be tested alike.

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The Japanese government's decision to log into users' IoT devices has sparked outrage in Japan. Many have argued that this is an unnecessary step, as the same results could be achieved by just sending a security alert to all users, as there's no guarantee that the users found to be using default or easy-to-guess passwords would change their passwords after being notified in private.</p>

<p>However, the government's plan has its technical merits. Many of today's IoT and router botnets are being built by hackers who take over devices with default or easy-to-guess passwords.</p>

<p>Hackers can also build botnets with the help of exploits and vulnerabilities in router firmware, but the easiest way to assemble a botnet is by collecting the ones that users have failed to secure with custom passwords.</p>

<p>Securing these devices is often a pain, as some expose Telnet or SSH ports online without the users' knowledge, and for which very few users know how to change passwords. Further, other devices also come with secret backdoor accounts that in some cases can't be removed without a firmware update. </p></blockquote>

<p>I am interested in the results of this survey. Japan isn't very different from other industrialized nations in this regard, so their findings will be general. I am less optimistic about the country's ability to secure all of this stuff -- especially before the 2020 Summer Olympics. </p>

	    <p>I understand his frustration, but <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/11/14/support-wouldnt-change-his-password-so-he-mailed-them-a-bomb/">this</a> is extreme:</p>

<blockquote><p>When police asked Cryptopay what could have motivated Salonen to send the company a pipe bomb Â­ or, rather, two pipe bombs, which is what investigators found when they picked apart the explosive package Â­ the only thing the company could think of was that it had declined his request for a password change.

<p>In August 2017, Salonen, a customer of Cryptopay, emailed their customer services team to ask for a new password. They refused, given that it was against the company's privacy policy.</p>

<p>A fair point, as it's never a good idea to send a new password in an email. A password-reset link is safer all round, although it's not clear if Cryptopay offered this option to Salonen.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Troy Hunt has a <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-insert-thing-here-is-not-a-password-killer/">good essay</a> about why passwords are here to stay, despite all their security problems:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is why passwords aren't going anywhere in the foreseeable future and why [insert thing here] isn't going to kill them. No amount of focusing on how bad passwords are or how many accounts have been breached or what it costs when people can't access their accounts is going to change that. Nor will the technical prowess of [insert thing here] change the discussion because it simply can't compete with passwords on that one metric organisations are so focused on: usability. Sure, there'll be edge cases and certainly there remain scenarios where higher-friction can be justified due to either the nature of the asset being protected or the demographic of the audience, but you're not about to see your everyday e-commerce, social media or even banking sites changing en mass.</p></blockquote>

<p>He rightly points out that biometric authentication systems -- like Apple's Face ID and fingerprint authentication -- augment passwords rather than replace them. And I want to add that good two-factor systems, like Duo, also augment passwords rather than replace them.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011784"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/10/security_vulner_17.html">Security Vulnerabilities in US Weapons Systems</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The US Government Accounting Office <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-128">just published</a> a new report: "<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf">Weapons Systems Cyber Security: DOD Just Beginning to Grapple with Scale of Vulnerabilities</a>" (summary <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694914.pdf">here</a>). The upshot won't be a surprise to any of my regular readers: they're vulnerable. </p>

<p>From the summary:</p>

<blockquote><p>Automation and connectivity are fundamental enablers of DOD's modern military capabilities. However, they make weapon systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Although GAO and others have warned of cyber risks for decades, until recently, DOD did not prioritize weapon systems cybersecurity. Finally, DOD is still determining how best to address weapon systems cybersecurity.

<p>In operational testing, DOD routinely found mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in systems that were under development, yet program officials GAO met with believed their systems were secure and discounted some test results as unrealistic. Using relatively simple tools and techniques, testers were able to take control of systems and largely operate undetected, due in part to basic issues such as poor password management and unencrypted communications. In addition, vulnerabilities that DOD is aware of likely represent a fraction of total vulnerabilities due to testing limitations. For example, not all programs have been tested and tests do not reflect the full range of threats.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is definitely easier, and cheaper, to ignore the problem or pretend it isn't a big deal. But that's probably a mistake in the long run.</p>

	    <p>It's amazing that this is even possible: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10250">SonarSnoop: Active Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We report the first active acoustic side-channel attack. Speakers are used to emit human inaudible acoustic signals and the echo is recorded via microphones, turning the acoustic system of a smart phone into a sonar system. The echo signal can be used to profile user interaction with the device. For example, a victim's finger movements can be inferred to steal Android phone unlock patterns. In our empirical study, the number of candidate unlock patterns that an attacker must try to authenticate herself to a Samsung S4 Android phone can be reduced by up to 70% using this novel acoustic side-channel. Our approach can be easily applied to other application scenarios and device types. Overall, our work highlights a new family of security threats.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The 1Password password manager has just <a href="https://blog.agilebits.com/2017/05/18/introducing-travel-mode-protect-your-data-when-crossing-borders/">introduced</a> "travel mode," which allows you to delete your stored passwords when you're in other countries or crossing borders:</p>

<blockquote><p>Your vaults aren't just hidden; they're completely removed from your devices <a href="https://support.1password.com/travel-mode">as long as Travel Mode is on</a>. That includes every item and all your encryption keys. There are no traces left for anyone to find. So even if you're asked to unlock 1Password by someone at the border, there's no way for them to tell that Travel Mode is even enabled.

<p>In 1Password Teams, Travel Mode is even cooler. If you're a team administrator, you have total control over which secrets your employees can travel with. You can turn Travel Mode on and off for your team members, so you can ensure that company information stays safe at all times.</p></blockquote>

<p>The way this works is important. If the scary border police demand that you unlock your 1Password vault, those passwords/keys are not there for the border police to find.</p>

<p>The only flaw -- and this is minor -- is that the system requires you to lie. When the scary border police ask you "do you have any other passwords?" or "have you enabled travel mode," you can't tell them the truth. In the US, lying to a federal office is a felony.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/laptop_security.html">previously described</a> a system that doesn't require you to lie. It's more complicated to implement, though.</p>

<p>This is a great feature, and I'm happy to see it implemented.</p>

	    <p>Imagine you've gotten your hands on a file of e-mail addresses and passwords. You want to monetize it, but the site it's for isn't very valuable. How do you use it? You convince the owners of the password to send you money.</p>

<p>I recently saw a spam e-mail that ties the password to a porn site. The e-mail title contains the password, which is sure to get the recipient's attention.</p>

<blockquote><p>I do know, yhhaabor, is your password. You may not know me and you're most likely thinking why you're getting this email, right?

<p>actually, I actually setup a malware on the adult video clips (pornographic material) web site and you know what, you visited this web site to have fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching videos, your web browser began operating as a RDP (Remote Desktop) having a key logger which provided me accessibility to your display and web camera. after that, my software obtained your entire contacts from your Messenger, social networks, and email.</p>

<p>What exactly did I do?</p>

<p>I created a double-screen video. First part shows the video you were viewing (you've got a fine taste ; )), and 2nd part displays the recording of your webcam.</p>

<p>What should you do?</p>

<p>Well, I believe, $2900 is a reasonable price for our little secret. You will make the payment through Bitcoin (if you don't know this, search "how to buy bitcoin" in Google).</p></blockquote>

<p>This is clever. The valid password establishes legitimacy. There's a decent chance the recipient has visited porn sites, and maybe set up an account for which they can't remember the password. The RDP attack is plausible, as is turning on the camera and downloading the contacts file.</p>

<p>Of course, it all fails because there isn't enough detail. If the attacker actually did all of this, they would include the name of the porn site and attached the video file.</p>

<p>But it's a clever attack, and one I have not seen before. If the attacker asked for an order of magnitude less money, I think they would make more.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD: Brian Krebs has <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/">written</a> about this, too.</p>

	    <p>Sotheby's is auctioning off a (working, I think) <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2018/history-of-science-technology-n09886/lot.41.html">three-rotor Enigma machine</a> today. They're expecting it to sell for about $200K.</p>

<p>I have an Enigma, but it's missing the rotors.</p>

	    <p>Yet another side-channel attack on smartphones: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11137">Hearing your touch: A new acoustic side channel on smartphones</a>," by Ilia Shumailov, Laurent Simon, Jeff Yan, and Ross Anderson.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present the first acoustic side-channel attack that recovers what users type on the virtual keyboard of their touch-screen smartphone or tablet. When a user taps the screen with a finger, the tap generates a sound wave that propagates on the screen surface and in the air. We found the device's microphone(s) can recover this wave and "hear" the finger's touch, and the wave's distortions are characteristic of the tap's location on the screen. Hence, by recording audio through the built-in microphone(s), a malicious app can infer text as the user enters it on their device. We evaluate the effectiveness of the attack with 45 participants in a real-world environment on an Android tablet and an Android smartphone. For the tablet, we recover 61% of 200 4-digit PIN-codes within 20 attempts, even if the model is not trained with the victim's data. For the smartphone, we recover 9 words of size 7-13 letters with 50 attempts in a common side-channel attack benchmark. Our results suggest that it not always sufficient to rely on isolation mechanisms such as TrustZone to protect user input. We propose and discuss hardware, operating-system and application-level mechanisms to block this attack more effectively. Mobile devices may need a richer capability model, a more user-friendly notification system for sensor usage and a more thorough evaluation of the information leaked by the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote>

<p>This must assume a standard keyboard layout but various third party programs make that easy to change. </p>

<p>@ jkli,</p>

<blockquote>This must assume a standard keyboard layout but various third party programs make that easy to change.</blockquote>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p>Each key press is diferent to the other key presses, but importantly with out other measures it becomes the same noise each time for the same key. This makes it the equivalent of a "simple substitution cipher" like the school child "pig-pen code". This acoustic substitution cipher and an equivalent gravatometer cipher are well know side channels in certain quaters. And can be broken in as little as 20 keypresses.</p>

<p>There are ways to take counter measures, but unless you get out the wire cutters / soldering iron to disconnect both the microphone and speaker (which can be used as a microphone) your only other options are various types of random noise generator or making the keyboard layout randomised very frequently like every key press...</p>

<p>@ All,</p>

<p>Yes I'm still alive but for various reasons I'm not going to be showing up very often. Thank you to all who have shown concern about me and the others who have dropped off this blog, it has made my ears glow more than a little pink. </p>

<p>@ Mitch</p>

<p>No, I think it should not work on a swipe keyboard at least not as easily as an accelerometer-based approach.  However no one types passwords on a swipe keyboard, up to my knowledge.</p>

<p>An easy workaround to this thread would be putting the keys on the pin pad on a random order each time a pin must be typed.</p>

<p>Surely there are easier ways to grab the data than this. More effort put into getting a standard keylogger or screen grab software onto the device would likely pay off better.</p>

<p>@0laf T. Hairy:</p>

<p>"Surely there are easier ways to grab the data than this."</p>

<p>But with every one 'grabing' at the low hanging fruit it quickly ceases to be available, so they then have to work that bit harder to get a 'free lunch'.</p>

<p>If it's your tree they are stealing your apples from, maybe knowing how apples get 'grabbed' at all levels is something you want to stop, that way they steal your neighbors apples instead, or even go pay for their lunch, likevthey are supposed to do.<br />

<p>@Petre Peter, you are right -- it is asking for your permissions, however, as we point in the paper, a lot of users simply give the applications access to everything that applications ask for. And applications ask for everything justifying that at some point in the future they will have a use for it. <br />
Furthermore, one can imagine scenarios with legitimate sensor usage -- imagine you talking on the phone with a bank, who asks you to open their app and confirm something. You do so and enter the app PIN (as for example Barclays asks you). If the recording of you typing in your PIN, we can decode this PIN with the knowledge of the phone model.</p>

<p>That is really an amazing way to recover information from people. this will really work wel.. you should keep working on it.</p>

	    <p>The Nest home alarm system shipped with a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3336227/security/nest-secure-had-a-secret-microphone-can-now-be-a-google-assistant.html">secret</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/googles-nest-security-system-shipped-with-a-secret-microphone/">microphone</a>, which -- according to the company -- was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/nest-microphone-was-never-supposed-to-be-a-secret-2019-2">only an accidental secret</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>On Tuesday, a Google spokesperson told Business Insider the company had made an "error."

<p>"The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the tech specs," the spokesperson said. "That was an error on our part."</p></blockquote>

<p>Where are the consumer protection agencies? They should be all over this.</p>

<p>And while they're figuring out which laws Google broke, they should also look at American Airlines. Turns out that some of their seats have <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/american-airlines-planes-entertainment-system-cameras">built-in cameras</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>American Airlines spokesperson Ross Feinstein confirmed to BuzzFeed News that cameras are present on some of the airlines' in-flight entertainment systems, but said "they have never been activated, and American is not considering using them." Feinstein added, "Cameras are a standard feature on many in-flight entertainment systems used by multiple airlines. Manufacturers of those systems have included cameras for possible future uses, such as hand gestures to control in-flight entertainment."</p></blockquote>

<p>That makes it all okay, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Actually, I kind of understand the airline seat camera thing. My guess is that whoever designed the in-flight entertainment system just specced a standard tablet computer, and they all came with unnecessary features like cameras. This is how we end up with refrigerators with Internet connectivity and Roombas with <a href="http://www.monohelixlabs.com/spying-on-roomba.html">microphones</a>. It's cheaper to leave the functionality in than it is to remove it.</p>

<p>Still, we need better disclosure laws.</p>

	    <p>After years of claiming that the Terrorist Screening Database is kept secret within the government, we have <a href="https://wtop.com/government/2019/02/apnewsbreak-feds-share-watchlist-with-1400-private-groups/">now learned</a> that the DHS shares it "with more than 1,400 private entities, including hospitals and universities...." </p>

<blockquote><p>Critics say that the watchlist is wildly overbroad and mismanaged, and that large numbers of people wrongly included on the list suffer routine difficulties and indignities because of their inclusion.

<p>The government's admission comes in a class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in Alexandria by Muslims who say they regularly experience difficulties in travel, financial transactions and interactions with law enforcement because they have been wrongly added to the list.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course that is the effect.</p>

<p>We need more transparency into this process. People need a way to challenge their inclusion on the list, and a redress process if they are being falsely accused.</p>

	    <p>Someone is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/19/gatwick-flights-halted-after-drone-sighting">flying a drone</a> over Gatwick Airport in order to disrupt service:</p>

<blockquote><p>Chris Woodroofe, Gatwick's chief operating officer, said on Thursday afternoon there had been another drone sighting which meant it was impossible to say when the airport would reopen.

<p>He told BBC News: "There are 110,000 passengers due to fly today, and the vast majority of those will see cancellations and disruption. We have had within the last hour another drone sighting so at this stage we are not open and I cannot tell you what time we will open.</p>

<p>"It was on the airport, seen by the police and corroborated. So having seen that drone that close to the runway it was unsafe to reopen."</p></blockquote>

<p>The economics of this kind of thing isn't in our favor. A drone is cheap. Closing an airport for a day is very expensive.</p>

<p>I don't think we're going to solve this by jammers, or GPS-enabled drones that won't fly over restricted areas. I've seen some technologies that will safely disable drones in flight, but I'm not optimistic about those in the near term. The best defense is probably punitive penalties for anyone doing something like this -- enough to discourage others.</p>

<p>There are a lot of similar security situations, in which the cost to attack is vastly cheaper than 1) the damage caused by the attack, and 2) the cost to defend. I have long believed that this sort of thing represents an <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2013/03/our_security_models.html">existential threat</a> to our society.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (12/23): The airport has deployed some <a href="https://m.jpost.com/International/Israeli-anti-drone-technology-brings-an-end-to-Gatwick-Airport-chaos-575054/amp">anti-drone technology</a> and reopened.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (1/2): Maybe there was <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/gatwick-drone-latest-police-say-it-is-a-possibility-there-was-never-a-drone-a4024626.html">never a drone</a>.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011678"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/08/dont_fear_the_t.html">Don't Fear the TSA Cutting Airport Security. Be Glad That They're Talking about It.</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Last week, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/tsa-considering-eliminating-screening-at-smaller-airports/index.html">CNN reported</a> that the Transportation Security Administration is considering eliminating security at U.S. airports that fly only smaller planes -- 60 seats or fewer. Passengers connecting to larger planes would clear security at their destinations.</p>

<p>To be clear, the TSA has put forth no concrete proposal. The internal agency working group's report obtained by CNN contains no recommendations. It's nothing more than 20 people examining the potential security risks of the policy change. It's not even new: The TSA considered this back in 2011, and the agency reviews its security policies every year. But commentary around the news has been <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/02/politics/tsa-airport-security/index.html">strongly negative</a>. Regardless of the idea's merit, it will almost certainly not happen. That's the result of politics, not security: Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of numerous outraged lawmakers, has already penned a letter to the agency saying that "TSA documents proposing to scrap critical passenger security screenings, without so much as a metal detector in place in some airports, would effectively clear the runway for potential terrorist attacks." He continued, "It simply boggles the mind to even think that the TSA has plans like this on paper in the first place."</p>

<p>We don't know enough to conclude whether this is a good idea, but it shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. We need to evaluate airport security based on concrete costs and benefits, and not continue to implement <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/beyond_fear/">security theater</a> based on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/01/stop_the_panic_on_ai.html">fear</a>. And we should applaud the agency's willingness to explore changes in the screening process.</p>

<p>There is already a tiered system for airport security, varying for both airports and passengers. Many people are enrolled in TSA PreCheck, allowing them to go through checkpoints faster and with less screening. Smaller airports don't have modern screening equipment like full-body scanners or CT baggage screeners, making it impossible for them to detect some plastic explosives. Any would-be terrorist is already able to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/01/profiling_makes_us_l.html">pick and choose</a> his flight conditions to suit his plot.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/12/why_the_tsa_cant_bac.html">written</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/11/a_waste_of_money_and.html">many</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2015/06/why_are_we_spending_.html">essays</a> critical of the TSA and airport security, in general. Most of it is security theater -- measures that make us feel safer without improving security. For example, the liquids ban makes no sense as implemented, because there's <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/10/time_to_show_bottle.html">no penalty for repeatedly trying</a> to evade the scanners. The full-body scanners are <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/12/hiding_petn_fro.html">terrible</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/german_tv_on_th.html">at</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/12/why_the_tsa_cant_bac.html">detecting</a> the explosive material PETN if it is well concealed -- which is their whole point.</p>

<p>There are two basic kinds of terrorists. The amateurs will be deterred or detected by even basic security measures. The professionals will figure out how to evade even the most stringent measures. I've <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/11/the-things-he-carried/307057/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/harms_of_post-9.html">said</a> that the two things that have made flying safer since 9/11 are reinforcing the cockpit doors and persuading passengers that they need to fight back. Everything beyond that isn't worth it.</p>

<p>It's always possible to increase security by adding more onerous -- and expensive -- procedures. If that were the only concern, we would all be strip-searched and prohibited from traveling with luggage. Realistically, we need to analyze whether the increased security of any measure is worth the cost, in money, time and convenience. We <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/21/tsa-spending-3-d-scanners/447410002/">spend $8 billion a year</a> on the TSA, and we'd like to get the most security possible for that money.</p>

<p>This is exactly what that TSA working group was doing. CNN <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/tsa-considering-eliminating-screening-at-smaller-airports/index.html">reported</a> that the group specifically evaluated the costs and benefits of eliminating security at minor airports, saving $115 million a year with a "small (nonzero) undesirable increase in risk related to additional adversary opportunity." That money could be used to bolster security at larger airports or to reduce threats totally removed from airports.</p>

<p>We need more of this kind of thinking, not less. In 2017, political scientists Mark Stewart and John Mueller published a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Are-Safe-Enough-Measuring-Assessing/dp/0128114754/">detailed evaluation</a> of airport security measures based on the cost to implement and the benefit in terms of lives saved. They concluded that most of what our government does either isn't effective at preventing terrorism or is simply too expensive to justify the security it does provide. Others might disagree with their conclusions, but their analysis provides enough detailed information to have a meaningful argument.</p>

<p>The more we politicize security, the worse we are. People are generally <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/05/psychology_of_securi.html">terrible</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/03/why_the_human_brain.html">judges</a> of risk. We fear threats in the news <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2012/07/drawing_the_wrong_le.html">out of proportion</a> with the actual dangers. We overestimate rare and spectacular risks, and underestimate commonplace ones. We fear specific "<a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2005/09/terrorists_dont_do_m.html">movie-plot threats</a>" that we can bring to mind. That's why we fear flying over driving, even though the latter kills about 35,000 people each year -- about a 9/11's worth of deaths each month. And it's why the idea of the TSA eliminating security at minor airports fills us with fear. We can imagine the plot unfolding, only without Bruce Willis saving the day.</p>

<p>Very little today is immune to politics, including the TSA. It drove most of the agency's decisions in the early years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That the TSA is willing to consider politically unpopular ideas is a credit to the organization. Let's let them perform their analyses in peace.</p>

	    <p>New research: "<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10611-018-9777-8">Leaving on a jet plane: the trade in fraudulently obtained airline tickets</a>:"</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Every day, hundreds of people fly on airline tickets that have been obtained fraudulently. This crime script analysis provides an overview of the trade in these tickets, drawing on interviews with industry and law enforcement, and an analysis of an online blackmarket. Tickets are purchased by complicit travellers or resellers from the online blackmarket. Victim travellers obtain tickets from fake travel agencies or malicious insiders. Compromised credit cards used to be the main method to purchase tickets illegitimately. However, as fraud detection systems improved, offenders displaced to other methods, including compromised loyalty point accounts, phishing, and compromised business accounts. In addition to complicit and victim travellers, fraudulently obtained tickets are used for transporting mules, and for trafficking and smuggling. This research details current prevention approaches, and identifies additional interventions, aimed at the act, the actor, and the marketplace.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Last month, the DHS announced that it was able to <a href="http://www.aviationtoday.com/2017/11/08/boeing-757-testing-shows-airplanes-vulnerable-hacking-dhs-says/">remotely hack</a> a Boeing 757:</p>

<blockquote><p>"We got the airplane on Sept. 19, 2016. Two days later, I was successful in accomplishing a remote, non-cooperative, penetration," said Robert Hickey, aviation program manager within the Cyber Security Division of the DHS Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate.

<p>"[Which] means I didn't have anybody touching the airplane, I didn't have an insider threat. I stood off using typical stuff that could get through security and we were able to establish a presence on the systems of the aircraft." Hickey said the details of the hack and the work his team are doing are classified, but said they accessed the aircraft's systems through radio frequency communications, adding that, based on the RF configuration of most aircraft, "you can come to grips pretty quickly where we went" on the aircraft.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>A Turkish Airlines flight made an emergency landing because someone <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-wifi/bomb-on-board-wi-fi-network-causes-turkish-airlines-flight-to-be-diverted-idUSKBN1DU205">named</a> his wireless network (presumably from his smartphone) "bomb on board."</p>

A decade later, it seems that the frequency of incidents like the one above is less, although not zero. Progress, I suppose.</p>

	    <p>In a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/06/14/2017-12281/special-conditions-embraer-sa-model-erj-190-300-airplane-electronic-system-security-protection-from">proposed rule</a> by the FAA, it argues that software in an Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 airplane is secure because it's proprietary:</p>

<blockquote><p>In addition, the operating systems for current airplane systems are usually and historically proprietary. Therefore, they are not as susceptible to corruption from worms, viruses, and other malicious actions as are more-widely used commercial operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, because access to the design details of these proprietary operating systems is limited to the system developer and airplane integrator. Some systems installed on the Embraer Model ERJ 190-300 airplane will use operating systems that are widely used and commercially available from third-party software suppliers. The security vulnerabilities of these operating systems may be more widely known than are the vulnerabilities of proprietary operating systems that the avionics manufacturers currently use.</p></blockquote>

<p>Longtime readers will immediately recognize the "security by obscurity" argument. Its main problem is that it's fragile. The information is likely less obscure than you think, and even if it is truly obscure, once it's published you've just lost all your security.</p>

<p>This is me from <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/02/the_insecurity_2.html">2014</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2004/10/the_non-security_of.html">2004</a>, and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0515.html#1">2002</a>.</p>

<p>The comment period for this proposed rule is ongoing. If you comment, please be polite -- they're more likely to listen to you.</p>

	    <p>The so-called Crypto Wars have been going on <a href="https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3407-doomed-to-repeat-history-lessons-from-the-crypto-wars-of-the-1990s/Crypto%20Wars_ReDo.7cb491837ac541709797bdf868d37f52.pdf">for 25 years</a> now. Basically, the FBI -- and some of their peer agencies in the UK, Australia, and elsewhere -- <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">argue</a> that the pervasive use of civilian encryption is hampering their ability to solve crimes and that they need the tech companies to make their systems susceptible to government eavesdropping. Sometimes their complaint is about communications systems, like voice or messaging apps. Sometimes it's about end-user devices. On the other side of this debate is pretty much all technologists working in computer security and cryptography, who <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">argue</a> that adding eavesdropping features fundamentally makes those systems less secure.</p>

<p>A recent entry in this debate is a <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">proposal</a> by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson, both from the UK's GCHQ (the British signals-intelligence agency -- basically, its NSA). It's actually a positive contribution to the discourse around backdoors; most of the time government officials broadly demand that the tech companies <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rod-rosenstein-encryption-backdoor/">figure out a way</a> to meet their requirements, without providing any details. Levy and Robinson write:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a world of encrypted services, a potential solution could be to go back a few decades. It's relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call. The service provider usually controls the identity system and so really decides who's who and which devices are involved -- they're usually involved in introducing the parties to a chat or call. You end up with everything still being end-to-end encrypted, but there's an extra 'end' on this particular communication. This sort of solution seems to be no more intrusive than the virtual crocodile clips that our democratically elected representatives and judiciary authorise today in traditional voice intercept solutions and certainly doesn't give any government power they shouldn't have.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the surface, this isn't a big ask. It doesn't affect the encryption that protects the communications. It only affects the authentication that assures people of whom they are talking to. But it's no less dangerous a backdoor than any others that have been proposed: It exploits a security vulnerability rather than fixing it, and it opens all users of the system to exploitation of that same vulnerability by others.</p>

<p>In a blog post, cryptographer Matthew Green <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">summarized</a> the technical problems with this GCHQ proposal. Basically, making this backdoor work requires not only changing the cloud computers that oversee communications, but it also means changing the client program on everyone's phone and computer. And that change makes all of those systems less secure. Levy and Robinson make a big deal of the fact that their backdoor would only be targeted against specific individuals and their communications, but it's still a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/62114/give-ghost-backdoor/">general backdoor</a> that <em>could</em> be used against anybody.</p>

<p>The basic problem is that a backdoor is a technical capability -- a vulnerability -- that is available to anyone who knows about it and has access to it. Surrounding that vulnerability is a procedural system that tries to limit access to that capability. Computers, especially internet-connected computers, are inherently hackable, limiting the effectiveness of any procedures. The best defense is to not have the vulnerability at all.</p>

<p>That old physical eavesdropping system Levy and Robinson allude to also exploits a security vulnerability. Because telephone conversations were unencrypted as they passed through the physical wires of the phone system, the police were able to go to a switch in a phone company facility or a junction box on the street and manually attach alligator clips to a specific pair and listen in to what that phone transmitted and received. It was a vulnerability that anyone could exploit -- not just the police -- but was mitigated by the fact that the phone company was a monolithic monopoly, and physical access to the wires was either difficult (inside a phone company building) or obvious (on the street at a junction box).</p>

<p>The functional equivalent of physical eavesdropping for modern computer phone switches is a requirement of a 1994 U.S. law called CALEA -- and similar laws in other countries. By law, telephone companies must engineer phone switches that the government can eavesdrop, mirroring that old physical system with computers. It is not the same thing, though. It doesn't have those same physical limitations that make it more secure. It can be administered remotely. And it's implemented by a computer, which makes it vulnerable to the same hacking that every other computer is vulnerable to.</p>

<p>This isn't a theoretical problem; these systems have been subverted. The most <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair">public incident</a> dates from 2004 in Greece. Vodafone Greece had phone switches with the eavesdropping feature mandated by CALEA. It was turned off by default in the Greek phone system, but the NSA managed to surreptitiously <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/">turn it on</a> and use it to eavesdrop on the Greek prime minister and over 100 other high-ranking dignitaries.</p>

<p>There's nothing distinct about a phone switch that makes it any different from other modern encrypted voice or chat systems; any remotely administered backdoor system will be just as vulnerable. Imagine a chat program added this GCHQ backdoor. It would have to add a feature that added additional parties to a chat from somewhere in the system -- and not by the people at the endpoints. It would have to suppress any messages alerting users to another party being added to that chat. Since some chat programs, like iMessage and Signal, automatically send such messages, it would force those systems to lie to their users. Other systems would simply never implement the "tell me who is in this chat conversation" featureÂ­which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>And once that's in place, every government will try to hack it for its own purposesÂ­ -- just as the NSA hacked Vodafone Greece. Again, this is nothing new. In 2010, China successfully hacked the back-door mechanism Google <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/china-google-attack-part-widespread-spying-effort-28293/">put in place</a> to meet law-enforcement requests. In 2015, someone -- we don't know who -- <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232227-where-did-i-leave-my-keys/abstract">hacked an NSA backdoor</a> in a random-number generator used to create encryption keys, changing the parameters so they could also eavesdrop on the communications. There are certainly other stories that haven't been made public.</p>

<p>Simply adding the feature erodes public trust. If you were a dissident in a totalitarian country trying to communicate securely, would you want to use a voice or messaging system that is known to have this sort of backdoor? Who would you bet on, especially when the cost of losing the bet might be imprisonment or worse: the company that runs the system, or your country's government intelligence agency? If you were a senior government official, or the head of a large multinational corporation, or the security manager or a critical technician at a power plant, would you want to use this system?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Two years ago, there was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-design-feature-encrypted-messages">rumor</a> of a WhatsApp backdoor. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/flawed-reporting-about-whatsapp">details</a> are <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">complicated</a>, and calling it a backdoor or a vulnerability <a href="https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/">is</a> <a href="http://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687">largely</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5nq201/whatsapp_backdoor_allows_snooping_on_encrypted/dce86wa/?st=jpfg671x&amp;sh=482f0949">inaccurate</a> -- but the resultant confusion caused some people to abandon the encrypted messaging service.</p>

<p>Trust is fragile, and <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/pjcis-2018/">transparency</a> is essential to trust. And while Levy and Robinson state that "any exceptional access solution should not fundamentally change the trust relationship between a service provider and its users," this proposal does exactly that. Communications companies could no longer be honest about what their systems were doing, and we would have no reason to trust them if they tried.</p>

<p>In the end, all of these exceptional access mechanisms, whether they exploit existing vulnerabilities that should be closed or force vendors to open new ones, reduce the security of the underlying system. They reduce our reliance on security technologies we know how to do well -- cryptography -- to computer security technologies we are much less good at. Even worse, they replace technical security measures with organizational procedures. Whether it's a database of master keys that could decrypt an iPhone or a communications switch that orchestrates who is securely chatting with whom, it is vulnerable to attack. And it will be attacked.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion is a specific example of a broader discussion that we need to have, and it's about the attack/defense balance. Which should we prioritize? Should we design our systems to be open to attack, in which case they can be exploited by law enforcement -- and others? Or should we design our systems to be as secure as possible, which means they will be better protected from hackers, criminals, foreign governments and -- unavoidably -- law enforcement as well?</p>

<p>This discussion is larger than the FBI's ability to solve crimes or the NSA's ability to spy. We know that foreign intelligence services are targeting the communications of our elected officials, our power infrastructure, and our voting systems. Do we really want some foreign country penetrating our lawful-access backdoor in the same way the NSA penetrated Greece's?</p>

<p>I have long maintained that we need to adopt a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/AC_StrategyPapers_No8_Saving_Cyberspace_WEB.pdf">defense-dominant strategy</a>: We should prioritize our need for security over our need for surveillance. This is especially true in the new world of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">physically capable computers</a>. Yes, it will mean that law enforcement will have a harder time eavesdropping on communications and unlocking computing devices. But law enforcement has <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">other forensic techniques</a> to collect surveillance data in our highly networked world. We'd be much better off <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20160301/104573/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-LandauS-20160301.pdf">increasing law enforcement's technical ability</a> to investigate crimes in the <a href="https://cdt.org/blog/%E2%80%98going-dark%E2%80%99-versus-a-%E2%80%98golden-age-for-surveillance%E2%80%99/">modern digital world</a> than we would be to weaken security for everyone. The ability to surreptitiously add ghost users to a conversation is a vulnerability, and it's one that we would be better served by closing than exploiting.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011752"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/09/security_vulner_16.html">Security Vulnerability in ESS ExpressVote Touchscreen Voting Computer</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Of course the ESS ExpressVote voting computer will have lots of security vulnerabilities. It's a computer, and computers have lots of vulnerabilities. This particular vulnerability is particularly interesting because it's the result of a security mistake in the design process. Someone didn't think the security through, and the result is a voter-verifiable paper audit trail that doesn't provide the security it promises.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/09/14/serious-design-flaw-in-ess-expressvote-touchscreen-permission-to-cheat/">details</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now there's an even worse option than "DRE with paper trail"; I call it "press this button if it's OK for the machine to cheat" option.   The country's biggest vendor of voting machines, ES&S, has a line of voting machines called ExpressVote.  Some of these are optical scanners (which are fine), and others are "combination" machines, basically a ballot-marking device and an optical scanner all rolled into one.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEEHDttuxI&amp;feature=youtu.be">This video</a> shows a demonstration of ExpressVote all-in-one touchscreens purchased by Johnson County, Kansas.  The voter brings a blank ballot to the machine, inserts it into a slot, chooses candidates.  Then the machine prints those choices onto the blank ballot and spits it out for the voter to inspect.  If the voter is satisfied, she inserts it back into the slot, where it is counted (and dropped into a sealed ballot box for possible recount or audit).</p>

<p>So far this seems OK, except that the process is a bit cumbersome and not completely intuitive (watch the video for yourself).  It still suffers from the problems I describe above: voter may not carefully review all the choices, especially in down-ballot races; counties need to buy a lot more voting machines, because voters occupy the machine for a long time (in contrast to op-scan ballots, where they occupy a cheap cardboard privacy screen).</p>

<p>But here's the amazingly bad feature:  "The version that we have has an option for both ways," [Johnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie] Metsker said. "We instruct the voters to print their ballots so that they can review their paper ballots, but they're not required to do so. If they want to press the button 'cast ballot,' it will cast the ballot, but if they do so they are doing so with full knowledge that they will not see their ballot card, it will instead be cast, scanned, tabulated and dropped in the secure ballot container at the backside of the machine."  [<a href="https://tyt.com/stories/4vZLCHuQrYE4uKagy0oyMA/5YIEQxHW5qmWayG0kYCsy2">TYT Investigates, article by Jennifer Cohn</a>, September 6, 2018]</p>

<p>Now it's easy for a hacked machine to cheat undetectably!  All the fraudulent vote-counting program has to do is wait until the voter chooses between "cast ballot without inspecting" and "inspect ballot before casting."  If the latter, then don't cheat <em>on this ballot.</em>  If the former, then change votes how it likes, and print those fraudulent votes on the paper ballot, <em>knowing that the voter has already given up the right to look at it.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>A voter-verifiable paper audit trail does not require every voter to verify the paper ballot. But it does require that every voter be able to verify the paper ballot. I am continuously amazed by how bad electronic voting machines are. Yes, they're computers. But they also seem to be designed by people who don't understand computer (or any) security.</p>

	    <p>Suprising no one, the security of police bodycams is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/police-body-camera-vulnerabilities/">terrible</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mitchell even realized that because he can remotely access device storage on models like the Fire Cam OnCall, an attacker could potentially plant malware on some of the cameras. Then, when the camera connects to a PC for syncing, it could deliver all sorts of malicious code: a Windows exploit that could ultimately allow an attacker to gain remote access to the police network, ransomware to spread across the network and lock everything down, a worm that infiltrates the department's evidence servers and deletes everything, or even cryptojacking software to mine cryptocurrency using police computing resources. Even a body camera with no Wi-Fi connection, like the CeeSc, can be compromised if a hacker gets physical access. "You know not to trust thumb drives, but these things have the same ability," Mitchell says.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011647"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/1passwords_trav.html">1Password's Travel Mode</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The 1Password password manager has just <a href="https://blog.agilebits.com/2017/05/18/introducing-travel-mode-protect-your-data-when-crossing-borders/">introduced</a> "travel mode," which allows you to delete your stored passwords when you're in other countries or crossing borders:</p>

<blockquote><p>Your vaults aren't just hidden; they're completely removed from your devices <a href="https://support.1password.com/travel-mode">as long as Travel Mode is on</a>. That includes every item and all your encryption keys. There are no traces left for anyone to find. So even if you're asked to unlock 1Password by someone at the border, there's no way for them to tell that Travel Mode is even enabled.

<p>In 1Password Teams, Travel Mode is even cooler. If you're a team administrator, you have total control over which secrets your employees can travel with. You can turn Travel Mode on and off for your team members, so you can ensure that company information stays safe at all times.</p></blockquote>

<p>The way this works is important. If the scary border police demand that you unlock your 1Password vault, those passwords/keys are not there for the border police to find.</p>

<p>The only flaw -- and this is minor -- is that the system requires you to lie. When the scary border police ask you "do you have any other passwords?" or "have you enabled travel mode," you can't tell them the truth. In the US, lying to a federal office is a felony.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/laptop_security.html">previously described</a> a system that doesn't require you to lie. It's more complicated to implement, though.</p>

<p>This is a great feature, and I'm happy to see it implemented.</p>

	    <p>"<a href="https://objective-see.com/products/dnd.html">Do Not Disturb</a>" is a Macintosh app that send an alert when the lid is opened. The idea is to detect computer tampering.</p>

<p>Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/do-not-disturb-app-macbook-evil-maid-attacks/">article</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Do Not Disturb goes a step further than just the push notification. Using the Do Not Disturb iOS app, a notified user can send themselves a picture snapped with the laptop's webcam to catch the perpetrator in the act, or they can shut down the computer remotely. The app can also be configured to take more custom actions like sending an email, recording screen activity, and keeping logs of commands executed on the machine. </p></blockquote>

<p>Can someone please make one of these for Windows?</p>

	    <p>Interesting research into undetectably adding backdoors into computer chips during manufacture: "<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13389-013-0068-0">Stealthy dopant-level hardware Trojans: extended version</a>," also available <a href="https://www.emsec.rub.de/media/crypto/veroeffentlichungen/2015/03/19/beckerStealthyExtended.pdf">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, hardware Trojans have drawn the attention of governments and industry as well as the scientific community. One of the main concerns is that integrated circuits, e.g., for military or critical-infrastructure applications, could be maliciously manipulated during the manufacturing process, which often takes place abroad. However, since there have been no reported hardware Trojans in practice yet, little is known about how such a Trojan would look like and how difficult it would be in practice to implement one. In this paper we propose an extremely stealthy approach for implementing hardware Trojans below the gate level, and we evaluate their impact on the security of the target device. Instead of adding additional circuitry to the target design, we insert our hardware Trojans by changing the dopant polarity of existing transistors. Since the modified circuit appears legitimate on all wiring layers (including all metal and polysilicon), our family of Trojans is resistant to most detection techniques, including fine-grain optical inspection and checking against "golden chips". We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by inserting Trojans into two designs -- a digital post-processing derived from Intel's cryptographically secure RNG design used in the Ivy Bridge processors and a side-channel resistant SBox implementationÂ­ -- and by exploring their detectability and their effects on security.</p></blockquote>

<p>The moral is that this kind of technique is <i>very</i> difficult to detect.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (4/13): Apologies. I didn't realize that this paper was from 2014.</p>

	    <p>Last week, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2019/01/evaluating_the_gchq_.html">evaluated the security</a> of a recent <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">GCHQ backdoor</a> proposal for communications systems. Furthering the debate, Nate Cardozo and Seth Schoen of EFF <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/detecting-ghosts-reverse-engineering-who-ya-gonna-call">explain</a> how this sort of backdoor can be detected:</p>

<blockquote><p>In fact, we think when the ghost feature is activeÂ­ -- silently inserting a secret eavesdropping member into an otherwise end-to-end encrypted conversation in the manner described by the GCHQ authorsÂ­ -- it could be detected (by the target as well as certain third parties) with at least four different techniques: binary reverse engineering, cryptographic side channels, network-traffic analysis, and crash log analysis. Further, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1082054696683085825">crash log analysis</a> could lead unrelated third parties to find evidence of the ghost in use, and it's even possible that binary reverse engineering could lead researchers to find ways to disable the ghost capability on the client side. It should be obvious that none of these possibilities are desirable for law enforcement or society as a whole. And while we've theorized some types of mitigations that might make the ghost less detectable by particular techniques, they could also impose considerable costs to the network when deployed at the necessary scale, as well as creating new potential security risks or detection methods.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other critiques of the system were written by <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">Susan Landau</a> and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">Matthew Green</a>.</p>

	    <p>The so-called Crypto Wars have been going on <a href="https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3407-doomed-to-repeat-history-lessons-from-the-crypto-wars-of-the-1990s/Crypto%20Wars_ReDo.7cb491837ac541709797bdf868d37f52.pdf">for 25 years</a> now. Basically, the FBI -- and some of their peer agencies in the UK, Australia, and elsewhere -- <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">argue</a> that the pervasive use of civilian encryption is hampering their ability to solve crimes and that they need the tech companies to make their systems susceptible to government eavesdropping. Sometimes their complaint is about communications systems, like voice or messaging apps. Sometimes it's about end-user devices. On the other side of this debate is pretty much all technologists working in computer security and cryptography, who <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">argue</a> that adding eavesdropping features fundamentally makes those systems less secure.</p>

<p>A recent entry in this debate is a <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">proposal</a> by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson, both from the UK's GCHQ (the British signals-intelligence agency -- basically, its NSA). It's actually a positive contribution to the discourse around backdoors; most of the time government officials broadly demand that the tech companies <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rod-rosenstein-encryption-backdoor/">figure out a way</a> to meet their requirements, without providing any details. Levy and Robinson write:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a world of encrypted services, a potential solution could be to go back a few decades. It's relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call. The service provider usually controls the identity system and so really decides who's who and which devices are involved -- they're usually involved in introducing the parties to a chat or call. You end up with everything still being end-to-end encrypted, but there's an extra 'end' on this particular communication. This sort of solution seems to be no more intrusive than the virtual crocodile clips that our democratically elected representatives and judiciary authorise today in traditional voice intercept solutions and certainly doesn't give any government power they shouldn't have.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the surface, this isn't a big ask. It doesn't affect the encryption that protects the communications. It only affects the authentication that assures people of whom they are talking to. But it's no less dangerous a backdoor than any others that have been proposed: It exploits a security vulnerability rather than fixing it, and it opens all users of the system to exploitation of that same vulnerability by others.</p>

<p>In a blog post, cryptographer Matthew Green <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">summarized</a> the technical problems with this GCHQ proposal. Basically, making this backdoor work requires not only changing the cloud computers that oversee communications, but it also means changing the client program on everyone's phone and computer. And that change makes all of those systems less secure. Levy and Robinson make a big deal of the fact that their backdoor would only be targeted against specific individuals and their communications, but it's still a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/62114/give-ghost-backdoor/">general backdoor</a> that <em>could</em> be used against anybody.</p>

<p>The basic problem is that a backdoor is a technical capability -- a vulnerability -- that is available to anyone who knows about it and has access to it. Surrounding that vulnerability is a procedural system that tries to limit access to that capability. Computers, especially internet-connected computers, are inherently hackable, limiting the effectiveness of any procedures. The best defense is to not have the vulnerability at all.</p>

<p>That old physical eavesdropping system Levy and Robinson allude to also exploits a security vulnerability. Because telephone conversations were unencrypted as they passed through the physical wires of the phone system, the police were able to go to a switch in a phone company facility or a junction box on the street and manually attach alligator clips to a specific pair and listen in to what that phone transmitted and received. It was a vulnerability that anyone could exploit -- not just the police -- but was mitigated by the fact that the phone company was a monolithic monopoly, and physical access to the wires was either difficult (inside a phone company building) or obvious (on the street at a junction box).</p>

<p>The functional equivalent of physical eavesdropping for modern computer phone switches is a requirement of a 1994 U.S. law called CALEA -- and similar laws in other countries. By law, telephone companies must engineer phone switches that the government can eavesdrop, mirroring that old physical system with computers. It is not the same thing, though. It doesn't have those same physical limitations that make it more secure. It can be administered remotely. And it's implemented by a computer, which makes it vulnerable to the same hacking that every other computer is vulnerable to.</p>

<p>This isn't a theoretical problem; these systems have been subverted. The most <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair">public incident</a> dates from 2004 in Greece. Vodafone Greece had phone switches with the eavesdropping feature mandated by CALEA. It was turned off by default in the Greek phone system, but the NSA managed to surreptitiously <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/">turn it on</a> and use it to eavesdrop on the Greek prime minister and over 100 other high-ranking dignitaries.</p>

<p>There's nothing distinct about a phone switch that makes it any different from other modern encrypted voice or chat systems; any remotely administered backdoor system will be just as vulnerable. Imagine a chat program added this GCHQ backdoor. It would have to add a feature that added additional parties to a chat from somewhere in the system -- and not by the people at the endpoints. It would have to suppress any messages alerting users to another party being added to that chat. Since some chat programs, like iMessage and Signal, automatically send such messages, it would force those systems to lie to their users. Other systems would simply never implement the "tell me who is in this chat conversation" featureÂ­which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>And once that's in place, every government will try to hack it for its own purposesÂ­ -- just as the NSA hacked Vodafone Greece. Again, this is nothing new. In 2010, China successfully hacked the back-door mechanism Google <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/china-google-attack-part-widespread-spying-effort-28293/">put in place</a> to meet law-enforcement requests. In 2015, someone -- we don't know who -- <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232227-where-did-i-leave-my-keys/abstract">hacked an NSA backdoor</a> in a random-number generator used to create encryption keys, changing the parameters so they could also eavesdrop on the communications. There are certainly other stories that haven't been made public.</p>

<p>Simply adding the feature erodes public trust. If you were a dissident in a totalitarian country trying to communicate securely, would you want to use a voice or messaging system that is known to have this sort of backdoor? Who would you bet on, especially when the cost of losing the bet might be imprisonment or worse: the company that runs the system, or your country's government intelligence agency? If you were a senior government official, or the head of a large multinational corporation, or the security manager or a critical technician at a power plant, would you want to use this system?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Two years ago, there was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-design-feature-encrypted-messages">rumor</a> of a WhatsApp backdoor. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/flawed-reporting-about-whatsapp">details</a> are <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">complicated</a>, and calling it a backdoor or a vulnerability <a href="https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/">is</a> <a href="http://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687">largely</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5nq201/whatsapp_backdoor_allows_snooping_on_encrypted/dce86wa/?st=jpfg671x&amp;sh=482f0949">inaccurate</a> -- but the resultant confusion caused some people to abandon the encrypted messaging service.</p>

<p>Trust is fragile, and <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/pjcis-2018/">transparency</a> is essential to trust. And while Levy and Robinson state that "any exceptional access solution should not fundamentally change the trust relationship between a service provider and its users," this proposal does exactly that. Communications companies could no longer be honest about what their systems were doing, and we would have no reason to trust them if they tried.</p>

<p>In the end, all of these exceptional access mechanisms, whether they exploit existing vulnerabilities that should be closed or force vendors to open new ones, reduce the security of the underlying system. They reduce our reliance on security technologies we know how to do well -- cryptography -- to computer security technologies we are much less good at. Even worse, they replace technical security measures with organizational procedures. Whether it's a database of master keys that could decrypt an iPhone or a communications switch that orchestrates who is securely chatting with whom, it is vulnerable to attack. And it will be attacked.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion is a specific example of a broader discussion that we need to have, and it's about the attack/defense balance. Which should we prioritize? Should we design our systems to be open to attack, in which case they can be exploited by law enforcement -- and others? Or should we design our systems to be as secure as possible, which means they will be better protected from hackers, criminals, foreign governments and -- unavoidably -- law enforcement as well?</p>

<p>This discussion is larger than the FBI's ability to solve crimes or the NSA's ability to spy. We know that foreign intelligence services are targeting the communications of our elected officials, our power infrastructure, and our voting systems. Do we really want some foreign country penetrating our lawful-access backdoor in the same way the NSA penetrated Greece's?</p>

<p>I have long maintained that we need to adopt a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/AC_StrategyPapers_No8_Saving_Cyberspace_WEB.pdf">defense-dominant strategy</a>: We should prioritize our need for security over our need for surveillance. This is especially true in the new world of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">physically capable computers</a>. Yes, it will mean that law enforcement will have a harder time eavesdropping on communications and unlocking computing devices. But law enforcement has <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">other forensic techniques</a> to collect surveillance data in our highly networked world. We'd be much better off <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20160301/104573/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-LandauS-20160301.pdf">increasing law enforcement's technical ability</a> to investigate crimes in the <a href="https://cdt.org/blog/%E2%80%98going-dark%E2%80%99-versus-a-%E2%80%98golden-age-for-surveillance%E2%80%99/">modern digital world</a> than we would be to weaken security for everyone. The ability to surreptitiously add ghost users to a conversation is a vulnerability, and it's one that we would be better served by closing than exploiting.</p>

	    <p>The UK's GCHQ delivers a brutally blunt <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/quantum-key-distribution">assessment</a> of quantum key distribution:</p>

<blockquote><p>QKD protocols address only the problem of agreeing keys for encrypting data. Ubiquitous on-demand modern services (such as verifying identities and data integrity, establishing network sessions, providing access control, and automatic software updates) rely more on authentication and integrity mechanisms -- such as digital signatures -- than on encryption.

<p>QKD technology cannot replace the flexible authentication mechanisms provided by contemporary public key signatures. QKD also seems unsuitable for some of the grand future challenges such as securing the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, social media, or cloud applications.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with them. It's a clever idea, but basically useless in practice. I don't even think it's anything more than a niche solution in a world where quantum computers have broken our traditional public-key algorithms.</p>

<p>Read the whole thing. It's short.</p>

<blockquote><p>Communications and Electronics Security Group (CESG), the information security arm of GCHQ, was credited with the discovery of two vulnerabilities that were patched by Apple last week.

<p>The flaws could allow hackers to corrupt memory and cause a denial of service through a crafted app or execute arbitrary code in a privileged context.</p>

<p>The memory handling vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-1822 and CVE-2016-1829) affect OS X El Capitan v10.11 and later operating systems, according to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206567">2016-003 security update</a>. The memory corruption vulnerabilities allowed hackers to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.<br />
</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The <i>Intercept</i> <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2653542-Juniper-Opportunity-Assessment-03FEB11-Redacted.html">just published</a> a 2011 GCHQ document outlining its exploit capabilities against Juniper networking equipment, including routers and NetScreen firewalls as part of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/12/23/juniper-firewalls-successfully-targeted-by-nsa-and-gchq/">this article</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>GCHQ currently has capabilities against:

<ul><li>Juniper NetScreen Firewalls models Ns5gt, N25, NS50, NS500, NS204, NS208, NS5200, NS5000, SSG5, SSG20, SSG140, ISG 1000, ISG 2000. Some reverse engineering maybe required depending on firmware revisions.

<p><li>Juniper Routers: M320 is currently being worked on and we would expect to have full support by the end of 2010.</p>

<p><li>No other models are currently supported.</p>

<p><li>Juniper technology sharing with NSA improved dramatically during CY2010 to exploit several target networks where GCHQ had access primacy.</ul></blockquote>

<p>Yes, the document said "end of 2010" even though the document is dated February 3, 2011.</p>

<p>This doesn't have much to do with the <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/12/back_door_in_ju.html">Juniper backdoor</a> currently in the news, but the document does provide even more evidence that (despite what the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/04/28/heartbleed-understanding-when-we-disclose-cyber-vulnerabilities">government says</a>) the NSA hoards vulnerabilities in commonly used software for attack purposes instead of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/05/dualuse_technol_1.html">improving</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/09/hacking_team_co.html">security</a> for everyone by disclosing it.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD: In thinking about the equities process, it's worth differentiating among three different things: bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits. Bugs are plentiful in code, but not all bugs can be turned into vulnerabilities. And not all vulnerabilities can be turned into exploits. Exploits are what matter; they're what everyone uses to compromise our security. Fixing bugs and vulnerabilities is important because they could potentially be turned into exploits.</p>

<p>I think the US government deliberately clouds the issue when they say that they disclose almost all bugs they discover, ignoring the much more important question of how often they disclose exploits they discover. What this document shows is that -- despite their insistence that they prioritize security over surveillance -- they like to hoard exploits against commonly used network equipment.</p>

	    <p>Facebook is making a new and stronger commitment to privacy. Last month, the company <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-hires-privacy-critics/">hired three</a> of its most vociferous critics and installed them in senior technical positions. And on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">wrote</a> that the company will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-privacy.html">pivot</a> to focus on private conversations over the public sharing that has long defined the platform, even while conceding that "frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services."</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/06/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-privacy/">ample</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/opinion/zuckerberg-privacy-facebook.html">reason</a> to question Zuckerberg's pronouncement: The company has made -- <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-03-facebook-history-privacy.html">and broken</a> -- many privacy promises over the years. And if you read his 3,000-word post carefully, Zuckerberg says nothing about changing Facebook's <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/">surveillance capitalism</a> business model. All the post discusses is making private chats more central to the company, which seems to be a play for increased market dominance and to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/07/facebook-privacy-domination">counter</a> the Chinese company WeChat.</p>

<p>In security and privacy, the devil is always in the details -- and Zuckerberg's post provides none. But we'll take him at his word and try to fill in some of the details here. What follows is a list of changes we should expect if Facebook is serious about changing its business model and improving user privacy.</p>

<p><strong>How Facebook treats people on its platform</strong></p>

<p><i>Increased transparency over advertiser and app accesses to user data.</i> Today, Facebook users can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992">download and view</a> much of the data the company has about them. This is important, but it doesn't go far enough. The company could be more transparent about what data it shares with advertisers and others and how it allows advertisers to select users they show ads to. Facebook could use its substantial skills in usability testing to help people understand the mechanisms advertisers use to show them ads or the reasoning behind what it chooses to show in user timelines. It could <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-privacy-optics-clear-history-zuckerberg">deliver on promises</a> in this area.</p>

<p><i>Better -- and more usable -- privacy options.</i> Facebook users have limited control over how their data is shared with other Facebook users and almost no control over how it is shared with Facebook's advertisers, which are the company's real customers. Moreover, the controls are buried deep behind complex and confusing menu options. To be fair, some of this is because privacy is complex, and it's hard to understand the results of different options. But much of this is deliberate; Facebook doesn't want its users to make their data private from other users.</p>

<p>The company could give people better control over how -- and whether -- their data is used, shared, and sold. For example, it could allow users to turn off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/opinion/zuckerberg-facebook-ads.html">individually targeted news and advertising</a>. By this, we don't mean simply making those advertisements invisible; we mean turning off the data flows into those tailoring systems. Finally, since most users stick to the default options when it comes to configuring their apps, a changing Facebook could tilt those defaults toward more privacy, requiring less tailoring most of the time.</p>

<p><i>More user protection from stalking.</i> "Facebook stalking" is often thought of as "stalking light," or "harmless." But stalkers are rarely harmless. Facebook should acknowledge this class of misuse and work with experts to build tools that protect all of its users, especially its most vulnerable ones. Such tools should guide normal people away from creepiness and give victims power and flexibility to enlist aid from sources ranging from advocates to police.</p>

<p><i>Fully ending real-name enforcement.</i> Facebook's real-names policy, requiring people to use their actual legal names on the platform, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/facebook-real-name-policy-hurts-people-creates-new-digital-divide">hurts</a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community">people</a> such as activists, victims of intimate partner violence, police officers whose work makes them targets, and anyone with a public persona who wishes to have control over how they identify to the public. There are many ways Facebook can improve on this, from ending enforcement to allowing verifying pseudonyms for everyoneÂ­ -- not just celebrities like Lady Gaga. Doing so would mark a clear shift.</p>

<p><strong>How Facebook runs its platform</strong></p>

<p><i>Increased transparency of Facebook's business practices.</i> One of the hard things about evaluating Facebook is the effort needed to get good information about its business practices. When violations are exposed by the media, as they regularly are, we are all surprised at the different ways Facebook violates user privacy. Most recently, the company <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzdxjx/facebook-phone-number-two-factor-authentication">used phone numbers</a> provided for two-factor authentication for advertising and networking purposes. Facebook needs to be both explicit and detailed about how and when it shares user data. In fact, a move from discussing "sharing" to discussing "transfers," "access to raw information," and "access to derived information" would be a visible improvement.</p>

<p><i>Increased transparency regarding censorship rules.</i> Facebook <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enforcement-hate-speech-rules-mistakes">makes choices</a> about what content is acceptable on its site. Those choices are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/30/failbook/">controversial</a>, implemented by thousands of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">low-paid workers</a> quickly implementing <a href="https://mashable.com/article/facebook-moderator-sues-ptsd/">unclear rules</a>. These are tremendously <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech">hard problems</a> without clear solutions. Even obvious rules like banning hateful words run into challenges when people try to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/30/failbook/">legitimately</a> discuss certain important topics. Whatever Facebook does in this regard, the company needs be more transparent about its processes. It should allow regulators and the public to audit the company's practices. Moreover, Facebook should share any innovative engineering solutions with the world, much as it currently <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/">shares</a> its data center engineering.</p>

<p><i>Better security for collected user data.</i> There have been numerous examples of attackers targeting cloud service platforms to gain access to user data. Facebook has a large and skilled product security team that <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/designing-security-for-billions/">says some of the right things</a>. That team needs to be involved in the design trade-offs for features and not just review the near-final designs for flaws. Shutting down a feature based on internal security analysis would be a clear message.</p>

<p><i>Better data security so Facebook sees less.</i> Facebook eavesdrops on almost every aspect of its users' lives. On the other hand, WhatsApp -- purchased by Facebook in 2014 -- provides users with end-to-end encrypted messaging. While Facebook knows who is messaging whom and how often, Facebook has no way of learning the contents of those messages. Recently, Facebook announced plans to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-plans-to-merge-whatsapp-messenger-and-instagram-backends-by-2020-reportedly/">combine</a> WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197222/facebook-messenger-instagram-end-to-end-encryption-feature-zuckerberg">extending WhatsApp's security</a> to the consolidated system. Changing course here would be a dramatic and negative signal.</p>

<p><i>Collecting less data from outside of Facebook.</i> Facebook doesn't just collect data about you when you're on the platform. Because its "like" button is on so many other pages, the company can collect data about you when you're not on Facebook. It even collects what it calls "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy">shadow profiles</a>" -- data about you even if you're not a Facebook user. This data is combined with other surveillance data the company buys, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/some-apps-send-data-about-menstruation-home-buying-facebook-wsj-n974711">health</a> and financial data. Collecting and saving less of this data would be a strong indicator of a new direction for the company.</p>

<p><i>Better use of Facebook data to prevent violence.</i> There is a trade-off between Facebook seeing less and Facebook doing more to prevent hateful and inflammatory speech. Dozens of people have been killed by mob violence because of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/on-whatsapp-fake-news-is-fast--and-can-be-fatal/2018/07/23/a2dd7112-8ebf-11e8-bcd5-9d911c784c38_story.html">fake news spread on WhatsApp</a>. If Facebook were doing a convincing job of controlling fake news without end-to-end encryption, then we would expect to hear how it could use patterns in metadata to handle encrypted fake news.</p>

<p><strong>How Facebook manages for privacy</strong></p>

<p><i>Create a team measured on privacy and trust.</i> Where companies spend their money tells you what matters to them. Facebook has a large and important <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40432085/how-facebooks-growth-team-used-science-and-empathy-to-reach-two-billion-users">growth team</a>, but what team, if any, is responsible for privacy, not as a matter of compliance or pushing the rules, but for engineering? Transparency in how it is staffed relative to other teams would be telling.</p>

<p><i>Hire a senior executive responsible for trust.</i> Facebook's current team has been focused on growth and revenue. Its one chief security officer, Alex Stamos, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17640852/facebook-cso-alex-stamos-departing-no-replacement">was not replaced</a> when he left in 2018, which may indicate that having an advocate for security on the leadership team led to debate and disagreement. Retaining a voice for security and privacy issues at the executive level, before those issues affected users, was a good thing. Now that responsibility is diffuse. It's unclear how Facebook measures and assesses its own progress and who might be held accountable for failings. Facebook can begin the process of fixing this by designating a senior executive who is responsible for trust.</p>

<p><i>Engage with regulators.</i> Much of Facebook's posturing seems to be an attempt to forestall regulation. Facebook sends lobbyists to Washington and other capitals, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/21/facebook-to-drop-on-site-support-for-political-campaigns.html">until recently</a> the company sent support staff to politician's offices. It has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment">secret lobbying campaigns against privacy laws</a>. And Facebook has <a href="https://epic.org/enforce-the-order/">repeatedly violated</a> a 2011 Federal Trade Commission consent order regarding user privacy. Regulating big technical projects is not easy. Most of the people who understand how these systems work understand them because they build them. Societies will regulate Facebook, and the quality of that regulation requires real education of legislators and their staffs. While businesses often want to avoid regulation, any focus on privacy will require strong government oversight. If Facebook is serious about privacy being a real interest, it will accept both government regulation and community input.</p>

<p>User privacy is traditionally against Facebook's core business interests. Advertising is its business model, and targeted ads sell better and more profitably -- and that requires users to engage with the platform as much as possible. Increased pressure on Facebook to manage propaganda and hate speech could easily lead to more surveillance. But there is pressure in the other direction as well, as users equate privacy with increased control over how they present themselves on the platform.</p>

<p>We don't expect Facebook to abandon its advertising business model, relent in its push for monopolistic dominance, or fundamentally alter its social networking platforms. But the company can give users important privacy protections and controls without abandoning <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/">surveillance capitalism</a>. While some of these changes will reduce profits in the short term, we hope Facebook's leadership realizes that they are in the best long-term interest of the company.</p>

<p>Facebook talks about community and bringing people together. These are admirable goals, and there's plenty of value (and profit) in having a sustainable platform for connecting people. But as long as the most important measure of success is short-term profit, doing things that help strengthen communities will fall by the wayside. Surveillance, which allows individually targeted advertising, will be prioritized over user privacy. Outrage, which drives engagement, will be prioritized over feelings of belonging. And corporate secrecy, which allows Facebook to evade both regulators and its users, will be prioritized over societal oversight. If Facebook now truly believes that these latter options are critical to its long-term success as a company, we welcome the changes that are forthcoming.</p>

	    <p>Data & Society just published</a> a report entitled "<a href="https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DS_Workplace_Monitoring_Surveillance_Explainer.pdf">Workplace Monitoring & Surveillance</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p>This explainer highlights four broad trends in employee monitoring and surveillance technologies:

<ul><li><b>Prediction and flagging tools</b> that aim to predict characteristics or behaviors of employees or that are designed to identify or deter perceived rule-breaking or fraud. Touted as useful management tools, they can augment biased and discriminatory practices in workplace evaluations and segment workforces into risk categories based on patterns of behavior.

<p><li><b>Biometric and health data</b> of workers collected through tools like wearables, fitness tracking apps, and biometric timekeeping systems as a part of employer- provided health care programs, workplace wellness, and digital tracking work shifts tools. Tracking non-work-related activities and information, such as health data, may challenge the boundaries of worker privacy, open avenues for discrimination, and raise questions about consent and workers' ability to opt out of tracking.</p>

<p><li><b>Remote monitoring and time-tracking</b> used to manage workers and measure performance remotely. Companies may use these tools to decentralize and lower costs by hiring independent contractors, while still being able to exert control over them like traditional employees with the aid of remote monitoring tools. More advanced time-tracking can generate itemized records of on-the-job activities, which can be used to facilitate wage theft or allow employers to trim what counts as paid work time.</p>

<p><li><b>Gamification and algorithmic management</b> of work activities through continuous data collection. Technology can take on management functions, such as sending workers automated "nudges" or adjusting performance benchmarks based on a worker's real-time progress, while gamification renders work activities into competitive, game-like dynamics driven by performance metrics. However, these practices can create punitive work environments that place pressures on workers to meet demanding and shifting efficiency benchmarks.</ul></blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/03/06/robo-taylorism.html">blog post</a> about this report, Cory Doctorow mentioned "the adoption curve for oppressive technology, which goes, 'refugee, immigrant, prisoner, mental patient, children, welfare recipient, blue collar worker, white collar worker.'" I don't agree with the ordering, but the sentiment is correct. These technologies are generally used first against people with diminished rights: prisoners, children, the mentally ill, and soldiers.</p>

	    <p>The Nest home alarm system shipped with a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3336227/security/nest-secure-had-a-secret-microphone-can-now-be-a-google-assistant.html">secret</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/googles-nest-security-system-shipped-with-a-secret-microphone/">microphone</a>, which -- according to the company -- was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/nest-microphone-was-never-supposed-to-be-a-secret-2019-2">only an accidental secret</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>On Tuesday, a Google spokesperson told Business Insider the company had made an "error."

<p>"The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the tech specs," the spokesperson said. "That was an error on our part."</p></blockquote>

<p>Where are the consumer protection agencies? They should be all over this.</p>

<p>And while they're figuring out which laws Google broke, they should also look at American Airlines. Turns out that some of their seats have <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/american-airlines-planes-entertainment-system-cameras">built-in cameras</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>American Airlines spokesperson Ross Feinstein confirmed to BuzzFeed News that cameras are present on some of the airlines' in-flight entertainment systems, but said "they have never been activated, and American is not considering using them." Feinstein added, "Cameras are a standard feature on many in-flight entertainment systems used by multiple airlines. Manufacturers of those systems have included cameras for possible future uses, such as hand gestures to control in-flight entertainment."</p></blockquote>

<p>That makes it all okay, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Actually, I kind of understand the airline seat camera thing. My guess is that whoever designed the in-flight entertainment system just specced a standard tablet computer, and they all came with unnecessary features like cameras. This is how we end up with refrigerators with Internet connectivity and Roombas with <a href="http://www.monohelixlabs.com/spying-on-roomba.html">microphones</a>. It's cheaper to leave the functionality in than it is to remove it.</p>

<p>Still, we need better disclosure laws.</p>

	    <p>The police are increasingly <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/reverse-location-search-warrants-google-police.html">getting search warrants</a> for information about all cell phones in a certain location at a certain time:</p>

<blockquote><p>Police departments across the country have been knocking at Google's door for at least the last two years with warrants to tap into the company's extensive stores of cellphone location data. Known as "reverse location search warrants," these legal mandates allow law enforcement to sweep up the coordinates and movements of every cellphone in a broad area. The police can then check to see if any of the phones came close to the crime scene. In doing so, however, the police can end up not only fishing for a suspect, but also gathering the location data of potentially hundreds (or thousands) of innocent people. There have only been anecdotal reports of reverse location searches, so it's unclear how widespread the practice is, but privacy advocates worry that Google's data will eventually allow more and more departments to conduct indiscriminate searches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it's not just Google who can provide this information.</p>

<p>I am also reminded of a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csec-used-airport-wi-fi-to-track-canadian-travellers-edward-snowden-documents-1.2517881">Canadian</a> <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news2/pdf/airports_redacted.pdf">surveillance program</a> disclosed by Snowden.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time talking about this sort of thing in <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/data_and_goliath/"><i>Data and Goliath</i></a>. Once you have everyone under surveillance all the time, many things are possible.</p>

	    <p>The <i>Wired</i> headline sums it up nicely -- "<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-hires-privacy-critics/">Facebook Hires Up Three of Its Biggest Privacy Critics</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p>In December, Facebook hired Nathan White away from the digital rights nonprofit Access Now, and put him in the role of privacy policy manager. On Tuesday of this week, lawyers Nate Cardozo, of the privacy watchdog Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Robyn Greene, of New America's Open Technology Institute, announced they also are going in-house at Facebook. Cardozo will be the privacy policy manager of WhatsApp, while Greene will be Facebook's new privacy policy manager for law enforcement and data protection.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know these people. They're ethical, and they're on the right side. I hope they continue to do their good work from inside Facebook. </p>

	    <p>Good essay: "<a href="https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/advancing-human-rights-design-dual-use-technology-industry">Advancing Human-Rights-By-Design In The Dual-Use Technology Industry</a>," by Jonathon Penney, Sarah McKune, Lex Gill, and Ronald J. Deibert:</p>

<blockquote><p>But businesses can do far more than these basic measures. They could adopt a "human-rights-by-design" principle whereby they commit to designing tools, technologies, and services to respect human rights by default, rather than permit abuse or exploitation as part of their business model. The "privacy-by-design" concept has gained currency today thanks in part to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires it. The overarching principle is that companies must design products and services with the default assumption that they protect privacy, data, and information of data subjects. A similar human-rights-by-design paradigm, for example, would prevent filtering companies from designing their technology with features that enable large-scale, indiscriminate, or inherently disproportionate censorship capabilitiesÂ­ -- like the Netsweeper feature that allows an ISP to block entire country top level domains (TLDs). DPI devices and systems could be configured to protect against the ability of operators to inject spyware in network traffic or redirect users to malicious code rather than facilitate it. And algorithms incorporated into the design of communications and storage platforms could account for human rights considerations in addition to business objectives. Companies could also join multi-stakeholder efforts like the Global Network Initiative (GNI), through which technology companies (including Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo) have taken the first step toward principles like transparency, privacy, and freedom of expression, as well as to self-reporting requirements and independent compliance assessments.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011854"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/11/how_surveillanc_1.html">How Surveillance Inhibits Freedom of Expression</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>In my book <cite>Data and Goliath</cite>, I write about the value of privacy. I talk about how it is essential for political liberty and justice, and for commercial fairness and equality. I talk about how it increases personal freedom and individual autonomy, and how the lack of it makes us all less secure. But this is probably the most important argument as to why society as a whole must protect privacy: it allows society to progress.</p>

<p>We know that surveillance has a chilling effect on freedom. People change their behavior when they live their lives under surveillance. They are less likely to speak freely and act individually. They self-censor. They become conformist. This is obviously true for government surveillance, but is true for corporate surveillance as well. We simply aren't as willing to be our individual selves when others are watching.</p>

<p>Let's take an example: hearing that parents and children are being separated as they cross the US border, you want to learn more. You visit the website of an international immigrants' rights group, a fact that is available to the government through mass Internet surveillance. You sign up for the group's mailing list, another fact that is potentially available to the government. The group then calls or e-mails to invite you to a local meeting. Same. Your license plates can be collected as you drive to the meeting; your face can be scanned and identified as you walk into and out of the meeting. If, instead of visiting the website, you visit the group's Facebook page, Facebook knows that you did and that feeds into its profile of you, available to advertisers and political activists alike. Ditto if you like their page, share a link with your friends, or just post about the issue.</p>

<p>Maybe you are an immigrant yourself, documented or not. Or maybe some of your family is. Or maybe you have friends or coworkers who are. How likely are you to get involved if you know that your interest and concern can be gathered and used by government and corporate actors? What if the issue you are interested in is pro- or anti-gun control, anti-police violence or in support of the police? Does that make a difference?</p>

<p>Maybe the issue doesn't matter, and you would never be afraid to be identified and tracked based on your political or social interests. But even if you are so fearless, you probably know someone who has more to lose, and thus more to fear, from their personal, sexual, or political beliefs being exposed.</p>

<p>This isn't just hypothetical. In the months and years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many of us censored what we spoke about on social media or what we searched on the Internet. We know from a 2013 PEN study that writers in the United States self-censored their browsing habits out of fear the government was watching. And this isn't exclusively an American event; Internet self-censorship is prevalent across the globe, China being a prime example.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this fear stagnates society in two ways. The first is that the presence of surveillance means society cannot experiment with new things without fear of reprisal, and that means those experimentsÂ­ -- if found to be inoffensive or even essential to society -- Â­cannot slowly become commonplace, moral, and then legal. If surveillance nips that process in the bud, change never happens. All social progressÂ­ -- from ending slavery to fighting for women's rightsÂ­ -- began as ideas that were, quite literally, dangerous to assert. Yet without the ability to safely develop, discuss, and eventually act on those assertions, our society would not have been able to further its democratic values in the way that it has.</p>

<p>Consider the decades-long fight for gay rights around the world. Within our lifetimes we have made enormous strides to combat homophobia and increase acceptance of queer folks' right to marry. Queer relationships slowly progressed from being viewed as immoral and illegal, to being viewed as somewhat moral and tolerated, to finally being accepted as moral and legal.</p>

<p>In the end, it was the public nature of those activities that eventually slayed the bigoted beast, but the ability to act in private was essential in the beginning for the early experimentation, community building, and organizing.</p>

<p>Marijuana legalization is going through the same process: it's currently sitting between somewhat moral, andÂ­ -- depending on the state or country in question -- Â­tolerated and legal. But, again, for this to have happened, someone decades ago had to try pot and realize that it wasn't really harmful, either to themselves or to those around them. Then it had to become a counterculture, and finally a social and political movement. If pervasive surveillance meant that those early pot smokers would have been arrested for doing something illegal, the movement would have been squashed before inception. Of course the story is more complicated than that, but the ability for members of society to privately smoke weed was essential for putting it on the path to legalization.</p>

<p>We don't yet know which subversive ideas and illegal acts of today will become political causes and positive social change tomorrow, but they're around. And they require privacy to germinate. Take away that privacy, and we'll have a much harder time breaking down our inherited moral assumptions.</p>

<p>The second way surveillance hurts our democratic values is that it encourages society to make more things illegal. Consider the things you doÂ­ -- the different things each of us doesÂ­ -- that portions of society find immoral. Not just recreational drugs and gay sex, but gambling, dancing, public displays of affection. All of us do things that are deemed immoral by some groups, but are not illegal because they don't harm anyone. But it's important that these things can be done out of the disapproving gaze of those who would otherwise rally against such practices.</p>

<p>If there is no privacy, there will be pressure to change. Some people will recognize that their morality isn't necessarily the morality of everyoneÂ­ -- and that that's okay. But others will start demanding legislative change, or using less legal and more violent means, to force others to match their idea of morality.</p>

<p>It's easy to imagine the more conservative (in the small-c sense, not in the sense of the named political party) among us getting enough power to make illegal what they would otherwise be forced to witness. In this way, privacy helps protect the rights of the minority from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>This is how we got Prohibition in the 1920s, and if we had had today's surveillance capabilities in the 1920s, it would have been far more effectively enforced. Recipes for making your own spirits would have been much harder to distribute. Speakeasies would have been impossible to keep secret. The criminal trade in illegal alcohol would also have been more effectively suppressed. There would have been less discussion about the harms of Prohibition, less "what if we didn't?" thinking. Political organizing might have been difficult. In that world, the law might have stuck to this day.</p>

<p>China serves as a cautionary tale. The country has long been a world leader in the ubiquitous surveillance of its citizens, with the goal not of crime prevention but of social control. They are about to further enhance their system, giving every citizen a "social credit" rating. The details are yet unclear, but the general concept is that people will be rated based on their activities, both online and off. Their political comments, their friends and associates, and everything else will be assessed and scored. Those who are conforming, obedient, and apolitical will be given high scores. People without those scores will be denied privileges like access to certain schools and foreign travel. If the program is half as far-reaching as early reports indicate, the subsequent pressure to conform will be enormous. This social surveillance system is precisely the sort of surveillance designed to maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>For social norms to change, people need to deviate from these inherited norms. People need the space to try alternate ways of living without risking arrest or social ostracization. People need to be able to read critiques of those norms without anyone's knowledge, discuss them without their opinions being recorded, and write about their experiences without their names attached to their words. People need to be able to do things that others find distasteful, or even immoral. The minority needs protection from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>Privacy makes all of this possible. Privacy encourages social progress by giving the few room to experiment free from the watchful eye of the many. Even if you are not personally chilled by ubiquitous surveillance, the society you live in is, and the personal costs are unequivocal.</p>

	    <p>The US <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/">Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board </a>is <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/executive-director/">looking</a> for a director. Among other things, this board has some oversight role over the NSA. More precisely, it can examine what any executive-branch agency is doing about counterterrorism. So it can examine the program of TSA watchlists, NSA anti-terrorism surveillance, and FBI counterterrorism activities.</p>

<p>The PCLOB was established in 2004 (when it didn't do much), disappeared from 2007-2012, and reconstituted in 2012. It issued a <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/library/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Records_Program.pdf">major report</a> on NSA surveillance in 2014. It has dwindled since then, having as few as one member. Last month, the Senate <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/senate-confirms-three-pclob-members-ahead-of-privacy-shield-second-annual-review/">confirmed</a> three new members, including Ed Felten.</p>

<p>So, potentially an important job if anyone out there is interested.</p>

	    <p>Interesting paper: "<a href="https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/btlj/vol33/iss2/1/">Open Data, Grey Data, and Stewardship: Universities at the Privacy Frontier</a>," by Christine Borgman:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> As universities recognize the inherent value in the data they collect and hold, they encounter unforeseen challenges in stewarding those data in ways that balance accountability, transparency, and protection of privacy, academic freedom, and intellectual property. Two parallel developments in academic data collection are converging: (1) open access requirements, whereby researchers must provide access to their data as a condition of obtaining grant funding or publishing results in journals; and (2) the vast accumulation of "grey data" about individuals in their daily activities of research, teaching, learning, services, and administration. The boundaries between research and grey data are blurring, making it more difficult to assess the risks and responsibilities associated with any data collection. Many sets of data, both research and grey, fall outside privacy regulations such as HIPAA, FERPA, and PII. Universities are exploiting these data for research, learning analytics, faculty evaluation, strategic decisions, and other sensitive matters. Commercial entities are besieging universities with requests for access to data or for partnerships to mine them. The privacy frontier facing research universities spans open access practices, uses and misuses of data, public records requests, cyber risk, and curating data for privacy protection. This Article explores the competing values inherent in data stewardship and makes recommendations for practice by drawing on the pioneering work of the University of California in privacy and information security, data governance, and cyber risk.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>This is an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/how-microsoft-found-a-huawei-driver-that-opened-systems-up-to-attack/">interesting story</a> of a serious vulnerability in a Huawei driver that Microsoft found. The vulnerability is similar in style to the NSA's DOUBLEPULSAR that was leaked by the Shadow Brokers -- believed to be the Russian government -- and it's obvious that this attack copied that technique.</p>

<p>What is less clear is whether the vulnerability -- which has been fixed -- was put into the Huwei driver accidentally or on purpose.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011941"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/01/security_flaws_3.html">Security Flaws in Children's Smart Watches</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/10/security_flaws_2.html">A year ago</a>, the Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/watchout-rapport-october-2017.pdf">published</a> an excellent security analysis of children's GPS-connected smart watches. The security was terrible. Not only could parents track the children, anyone else could also track the children.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/gps-watch-issues-again/">recent analysis</a> checked if anything had improved after that torrent of bad press. Short answer: no.</p>

<blockquote><p>Guess what: a train wreck. Anyone could access the entire database, including real time child location, name, parents details etc. Not just Gator watches either -- the same back end covered multiple brands and tens of thousands of watches

<p>The Gator web backend was passing the user level as a parameter. Changing that value to another number gave super admin access throughout the platform. The system failed to validate that the user had the appropriate permission to take admin control!</p>

<p>This means that an attacker could get full access to all account information and all watch information. They could view any user of the system and any device on the system, including its location. They could manipulate everything and even change users' emails/passwords to lock them out of their watch.</p>

<p>In fairness, upon our reporting of the vulnerability to them, Gator got it fixed in 48 hours.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a lesson in the limits of naming and shaming: publishing vulnerabilities in an effort to get companies to improve their security. If a company is specifically named, it is likely to improve the specific vulnerability described. But that is unlikely to translate into improved security practices in the future. If an industry, or product category, is named generally, nothing is likely to happen. This is one of the reasons I am a <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">proponent of regulation</a>.</p>

<p>News <a href="https://threatpost.com/kid-tracking-watches-location-data/141335/">article</a>.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (2/13): The EU has acted in a <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/04/european_commission_security_risks_kids_smartwatch/">similar case</a>.</p>

	    <p>This is kind of a crazy iPhone <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/facetime-bug-hear-audio/">vulnerability</a>: it's possible to call someone on FaceTime and listen on their microphone -- and see from their camera -- before they accept the call.</p>

<p>This is definitely an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/technology/personaltech/facetime-bug-iphone-hack.html">embarrassment</a>, and Apple was right to disable Group FaceTime until it's fixed. But it's hard to imagine how an adversary can operationalize this in any useful way.</p>

<p>New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo wrote: "The FaceTime bug is an egregious breach of privacy that puts New Yorkers at risk." Kinda, I guess.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (1/30): This bug/vulnerability was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/facetime-glitch-apple.html">first discovered</a> by a 14-year-old, whose mother tried to alert Apple with no success.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011932"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/01/japanese_govern.html">Japanese Government Will Hack Citizens' IoT Devices</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The Japanese government is going to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/japanese-government-plans-to-hack-into-citizens-iot-devices/">run penetration tests</a> against all the IoT devices in their country, in an effort to (1) figure out what's insecure, and (2) help consumers secure them:</p>

<blockquote><p>The survey is scheduled to kick off next month, when authorities plan to test the password security of over 200 million IoT devices, beginning with routers and web cameras. Devices in people's homes and on enterprise networks will be tested alike.

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The Japanese government's decision to log into users' IoT devices has sparked outrage in Japan. Many have argued that this is an unnecessary step, as the same results could be achieved by just sending a security alert to all users, as there's no guarantee that the users found to be using default or easy-to-guess passwords would change their passwords after being notified in private.</p>

<p>However, the government's plan has its technical merits. Many of today's IoT and router botnets are being built by hackers who take over devices with default or easy-to-guess passwords.</p>

<p>Hackers can also build botnets with the help of exploits and vulnerabilities in router firmware, but the easiest way to assemble a botnet is by collecting the ones that users have failed to secure with custom passwords.</p>

<p>Securing these devices is often a pain, as some expose Telnet or SSH ports online without the users' knowledge, and for which very few users know how to change passwords. Further, other devices also come with secret backdoor accounts that in some cases can't be removed without a firmware update. </p></blockquote>

<p>I am interested in the results of this survey. Japan isn't very different from other industrialized nations in this regard, so their findings will be general. I am less optimistic about the country's ability to secure all of this stuff -- especially before the 2020 Summer Olympics. </p>

	    <p>Construction cranes are <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/attacks-against-industrial-machines-via-vulnerable-radio-remote-controllers-security-analysis-and-recommendations">vulnerable</a> to hacking:</p>

<blockquote><p>In our research and vulnerability discoveries, we found that weaknesses in the controllers can be (easily) taken advantage of to move full-sized machines such as cranes used in construction sites and factories. In the different attack classes that we've outlined, we were able to perform the attacks quickly and even switch on the controlled machine despite an operator's having issued an emergency stop (e-stop).

<p>The core of the problem lies in how, instead of depending on wireless, standard technologies, these industrial remote controllers rely on proprietary RF protocols, which are decades old and are primarily focused on <i>safety</i> at the expense of <i>security</i>. It wasn't until the arrival of Industry 4.0, as well as the continuing adoption of the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/industrial-internet-of-things-iiot">industrial internet of things (IIoT)</a>, that industries began to acknowledge the pressing need for security.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The so-called Crypto Wars have been going on <a href="https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3407-doomed-to-repeat-history-lessons-from-the-crypto-wars-of-the-1990s/Crypto%20Wars_ReDo.7cb491837ac541709797bdf868d37f52.pdf">for 25 years</a> now. Basically, the FBI -- and some of their peer agencies in the UK, Australia, and elsewhere -- <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">argue</a> that the pervasive use of civilian encryption is hampering their ability to solve crimes and that they need the tech companies to make their systems susceptible to government eavesdropping. Sometimes their complaint is about communications systems, like voice or messaging apps. Sometimes it's about end-user devices. On the other side of this debate is pretty much all technologists working in computer security and cryptography, who <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">argue</a> that adding eavesdropping features fundamentally makes those systems less secure.</p>

<p>A recent entry in this debate is a <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">proposal</a> by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson, both from the UK's GCHQ (the British signals-intelligence agency -- basically, its NSA). It's actually a positive contribution to the discourse around backdoors; most of the time government officials broadly demand that the tech companies <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rod-rosenstein-encryption-backdoor/">figure out a way</a> to meet their requirements, without providing any details. Levy and Robinson write:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a world of encrypted services, a potential solution could be to go back a few decades. It's relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call. The service provider usually controls the identity system and so really decides who's who and which devices are involved -- they're usually involved in introducing the parties to a chat or call. You end up with everything still being end-to-end encrypted, but there's an extra 'end' on this particular communication. This sort of solution seems to be no more intrusive than the virtual crocodile clips that our democratically elected representatives and judiciary authorise today in traditional voice intercept solutions and certainly doesn't give any government power they shouldn't have.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the surface, this isn't a big ask. It doesn't affect the encryption that protects the communications. It only affects the authentication that assures people of whom they are talking to. But it's no less dangerous a backdoor than any others that have been proposed: It exploits a security vulnerability rather than fixing it, and it opens all users of the system to exploitation of that same vulnerability by others.</p>

<p>In a blog post, cryptographer Matthew Green <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">summarized</a> the technical problems with this GCHQ proposal. Basically, making this backdoor work requires not only changing the cloud computers that oversee communications, but it also means changing the client program on everyone's phone and computer. And that change makes all of those systems less secure. Levy and Robinson make a big deal of the fact that their backdoor would only be targeted against specific individuals and their communications, but it's still a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/62114/give-ghost-backdoor/">general backdoor</a> that <em>could</em> be used against anybody.</p>

<p>The basic problem is that a backdoor is a technical capability -- a vulnerability -- that is available to anyone who knows about it and has access to it. Surrounding that vulnerability is a procedural system that tries to limit access to that capability. Computers, especially internet-connected computers, are inherently hackable, limiting the effectiveness of any procedures. The best defense is to not have the vulnerability at all.</p>

<p>That old physical eavesdropping system Levy and Robinson allude to also exploits a security vulnerability. Because telephone conversations were unencrypted as they passed through the physical wires of the phone system, the police were able to go to a switch in a phone company facility or a junction box on the street and manually attach alligator clips to a specific pair and listen in to what that phone transmitted and received. It was a vulnerability that anyone could exploit -- not just the police -- but was mitigated by the fact that the phone company was a monolithic monopoly, and physical access to the wires was either difficult (inside a phone company building) or obvious (on the street at a junction box).</p>

<p>The functional equivalent of physical eavesdropping for modern computer phone switches is a requirement of a 1994 U.S. law called CALEA -- and similar laws in other countries. By law, telephone companies must engineer phone switches that the government can eavesdrop, mirroring that old physical system with computers. It is not the same thing, though. It doesn't have those same physical limitations that make it more secure. It can be administered remotely. And it's implemented by a computer, which makes it vulnerable to the same hacking that every other computer is vulnerable to.</p>

<p>This isn't a theoretical problem; these systems have been subverted. The most <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair">public incident</a> dates from 2004 in Greece. Vodafone Greece had phone switches with the eavesdropping feature mandated by CALEA. It was turned off by default in the Greek phone system, but the NSA managed to surreptitiously <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/">turn it on</a> and use it to eavesdrop on the Greek prime minister and over 100 other high-ranking dignitaries.</p>

<p>There's nothing distinct about a phone switch that makes it any different from other modern encrypted voice or chat systems; any remotely administered backdoor system will be just as vulnerable. Imagine a chat program added this GCHQ backdoor. It would have to add a feature that added additional parties to a chat from somewhere in the system -- and not by the people at the endpoints. It would have to suppress any messages alerting users to another party being added to that chat. Since some chat programs, like iMessage and Signal, automatically send such messages, it would force those systems to lie to their users. Other systems would simply never implement the "tell me who is in this chat conversation" featureÂ­which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>And once that's in place, every government will try to hack it for its own purposesÂ­ -- just as the NSA hacked Vodafone Greece. Again, this is nothing new. In 2010, China successfully hacked the back-door mechanism Google <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/china-google-attack-part-widespread-spying-effort-28293/">put in place</a> to meet law-enforcement requests. In 2015, someone -- we don't know who -- <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232227-where-did-i-leave-my-keys/abstract">hacked an NSA backdoor</a> in a random-number generator used to create encryption keys, changing the parameters so they could also eavesdrop on the communications. There are certainly other stories that haven't been made public.</p>

<p>Simply adding the feature erodes public trust. If you were a dissident in a totalitarian country trying to communicate securely, would you want to use a voice or messaging system that is known to have this sort of backdoor? Who would you bet on, especially when the cost of losing the bet might be imprisonment or worse: the company that runs the system, or your country's government intelligence agency? If you were a senior government official, or the head of a large multinational corporation, or the security manager or a critical technician at a power plant, would you want to use this system?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Two years ago, there was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-design-feature-encrypted-messages">rumor</a> of a WhatsApp backdoor. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/flawed-reporting-about-whatsapp">details</a> are <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">complicated</a>, and calling it a backdoor or a vulnerability <a href="https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/">is</a> <a href="http://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687">largely</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5nq201/whatsapp_backdoor_allows_snooping_on_encrypted/dce86wa/?st=jpfg671x&amp;sh=482f0949">inaccurate</a> -- but the resultant confusion caused some people to abandon the encrypted messaging service.</p>

<p>Trust is fragile, and <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/pjcis-2018/">transparency</a> is essential to trust. And while Levy and Robinson state that "any exceptional access solution should not fundamentally change the trust relationship between a service provider and its users," this proposal does exactly that. Communications companies could no longer be honest about what their systems were doing, and we would have no reason to trust them if they tried.</p>

<p>In the end, all of these exceptional access mechanisms, whether they exploit existing vulnerabilities that should be closed or force vendors to open new ones, reduce the security of the underlying system. They reduce our reliance on security technologies we know how to do well -- cryptography -- to computer security technologies we are much less good at. Even worse, they replace technical security measures with organizational procedures. Whether it's a database of master keys that could decrypt an iPhone or a communications switch that orchestrates who is securely chatting with whom, it is vulnerable to attack. And it will be attacked.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion is a specific example of a broader discussion that we need to have, and it's about the attack/defense balance. Which should we prioritize? Should we design our systems to be open to attack, in which case they can be exploited by law enforcement -- and others? Or should we design our systems to be as secure as possible, which means they will be better protected from hackers, criminals, foreign governments and -- unavoidably -- law enforcement as well?</p>

<p>This discussion is larger than the FBI's ability to solve crimes or the NSA's ability to spy. We know that foreign intelligence services are targeting the communications of our elected officials, our power infrastructure, and our voting systems. Do we really want some foreign country penetrating our lawful-access backdoor in the same way the NSA penetrated Greece's?</p>

<p>I have long maintained that we need to adopt a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/AC_StrategyPapers_No8_Saving_Cyberspace_WEB.pdf">defense-dominant strategy</a>: We should prioritize our need for security over our need for surveillance. This is especially true in the new world of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">physically capable computers</a>. Yes, it will mean that law enforcement will have a harder time eavesdropping on communications and unlocking computing devices. But law enforcement has <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">other forensic techniques</a> to collect surveillance data in our highly networked world. We'd be much better off <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20160301/104573/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-LandauS-20160301.pdf">increasing law enforcement's technical ability</a> to investigate crimes in the <a href="https://cdt.org/blog/%E2%80%98going-dark%E2%80%99-versus-a-%E2%80%98golden-age-for-surveillance%E2%80%99/">modern digital world</a> than we would be to weaken security for everyone. The ability to surreptitiously add ghost users to a conversation is a vulnerability, and it's one that we would be better served by closing than exploiting.</p>

<p>April Fools hoax stories could offer clues to help identify 'fake news':<br />
<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190329130206.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190329130206.htm</a></p>

<p>"Researchers focused on specific features within the texts, such as the amount of details used, vagueness, formality of writing style and complexity of language.<br />
They found April Fools hoaxes and fake news articles tend to contain less complex language, an easier reading difficulty, and longer sentences than genuine news.</p>

<p>Important details for news stories, such as names, places, dates and times, were found to be used less frequently within April Fools hoaxes and fake news.</p>

<p>The researchers found that April fools hoax stories, when compared to genuine news:<br />
â¢Are generally shorter in length<br />
â¢Use more unique words<br />
â¢Use longer sentences<br />
â¢Are easier to read<br />
â¢Refer to vague events in the future<br />
â¢Contain more references to the present<br />
â¢Are less interested in past events<br />
â¢Contain fewer proper nouns<br />
â¢Use more first person pronouns</p>

<p>Fake news stories, when compared to genuine news:<br />
â¢Are shorter in length<br />
â¢Are easier to read<br />
â¢Use simplistic language<br />
â¢Contain fewer punctuation marks<br />
â¢Contain more proper nouns<br />
â¢Are generally less formal -- use more first names such as 'Hillary' and contain more profanity and spelling mistakes<br />
â¢Contain very few dates<br />
â¢Use more first person pronouns</p>

<p>The researchers also created a machine learning 'classifier' to identify if articles are April Fools hoaxes, fake news or genuine news stories. The classifier achieved a 75 per cent accuracy at identifying April Fools articles and 72 per cent for identifying fake news stories. When the classifier was trained on April Fools hoaxes and set the task of identifying fake news it recorded an accuracy of more than 65 per cent.</p>

<p>"Our findings suggest that there are certain features in common between different forms of disinformation and exploring these similarities may provide important insights for future research into deceptive news stories."</p>

<p>Is it possible to train AI classifier to find out degree of truthfulness during LEAs/IC interrogation and/or asylum seeking interviews?<br />

<p><b>"Emails of nearly 1 billion people leaked in massive data breach"</b> </p>

<p><i>"The emails of nearly 1 billion people were leaked in what experts say is likely the biggest data breach of all time, according to reports.</i></p>

<p>At least 982 million usersâ personal information was exposed during the tech firm Verifications.ioâs massive privacy breach late last month, according to Unilad.co.uk."</p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/29/emails-of-nearly-1-billion-people-leaked-in-massive-data-breach/" rel="nofollow">https://nypost.com/2019/03/29/emails-of-nearly-1-billion-people-leaked-in-massive-data-breach/</a>  (and many other sites)</p>

<p>Seems our data is hopelessly insecure. I read somewhere .io urls were notoriously corrupted and used by criminals. Guess this is somewhat of a proof.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I looked myself up on a free website recently. Amazing detail is available, for free, about me who tries to keep his data off the grid.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure the only way to fix this is to re-invent the internet from the bottom up. Start all over. Not going to happen though, is it?</p>

<p><b>"The EU tentatively backed a plan to fit every car starting in 2022 with a device meant to automatically stop drivers from speeding"</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eu-fit-new-cars-software-stop-breaking-speed-limit-after-2022-2019-3" rel="nofollow">https://www.businessinsider.com/eu-fit-new-cars-software-stop-breaking-speed-limit-after-2022-2019-3</a></p>

<p> "The European Union has approved draft legislation that would require every new car sold in Europe starting in 2022 to include software meant to slow drivers down when they speed.<br />
The "Intelligent Speed Assistance" software uses a combination of GPS, sign-recognition cameras, and maps to work out whether a vehicle is passing the local speed limit."</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the article:</p>

<p>"Drivers would be able to override the software by pushing hard on the accelerator."</p>

<p>All kinds of issues with this decree, starting with the technology that allows the government to literally minutely track AND drive your car. I have to stop here, else resort to an unpleasant rant.</p>

<p>@Alejandro:</p>

<p>"the technology that allows the government to literally minutely track AND drive your car."</p>

<p>The technology already exists and has been in use in a high end Japanese sports car, and a variation is going into Fords,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/does-it-work-fords-intelligent-speed-limiter-car-september-2015/" rel="nofollow">https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/does-it-work-fords-intelligent-speed-limiter-car-september-2015/</a></p>

<p>Whilst the driver in the car knows where it is like any other with GPS, unlike other systems in US cars it is not going to 'track' back to the government minutely or otherwise.</p>

<p>But a proposal to track peoples cars by GPS minutely was given consideration by the UK Government a decade or so ago with respect to setting up 'electronic tolls' to replace the 'Road Fund' vehicle tax. It was in part ditched because the tracking would not have been 'minutely' enough due to the positional error of GPS. In the UK there are numerous numbers of 'local traffic' B roads,that run right next to 'through traffic' A roads and 'long distance traffic' Motorways (see London A4/M4 Westway on a flyover above the local roads for instance). The problem although long known was highlighted by a German system for transport vehicals,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/09/motoring.transportintheuk" rel="nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/09/motoring.transportintheuk</a></p>

<p>This same problem will happen with this new EU proposal for exactly the same reason. Because generally B roads have a considerably lower speed limit than A roads, but not all the time as with motorways some A roads can have their speed limit changed several times a day based not on the time of day but on the weight of traffic*. It is possible and has happened I've seen it on more than a couple of occasions when biking that the A road speed limit gets taken down below the B road limit. With the error term in GPS this is a recipe for not just accidents but litigation as well.</p>

<p>It's probably the reason Ford decided to try using OCR techniques to read road signs. Such a system provided the roads are corectly marked --and few are in rural areas-- would not need to use tracking at all.</p>

<p>* The reason for this is the 'stopping distance' issue. Put simply stoping distance has two components 'thinking distance' and 'brakeing distance', whilst thinking distance is proportional to speed breaking distance is related to speed squared. Thus the safe density of cars on a road is related to speed squared. Slow the speed just a little and the number of vehicles in any given section of road goes up to a power law, which means total safe throuput of vehicles in any given time also goes up to the same power law.   </p>

<p>On the Squid article,</p>

<p>"'Stuffing an animal skin with a foam rubber replicaâthe classic methodâdoesn't work for squids,'"</p>

<p>Did make me smile.</p>

<p>Use of 'foam rubber' is actually 'the modern way' of the 'traditional process'. In times past, Plaster of Paris has been used as well as those good old furniture stuffing materials straw, horse hair, and cotton waste (all of which attract moths and other 'wee beasties' as kindergartens).</p>

<p>Plastification is very much not the traditional method and in taxidermy is concidered an entirely new ultra modern uncertain method that is not yet trusted. Because it derives from an earlier process where blood vessels were filled with a fluid that became plastic then the flesh was disolved away. There is thus the question of the 'preserving factor' of the original organic material and will it last three or four centuries or more that the 'traditional methods' can do.</p>

<p>I guess another example of 'journalistic licence'. </p>

<p>@All</p>

<p>Brief description of the Verifications[.]io breach here:<br />
<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#VerificationsIO" rel="nofollow">https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#VerificationsIO</a><br />
Note that while sources say 900(ish)-million records were exposed, Troy Hunt reports that "only" 763M email addresses were exposed.</p>

<p>You might be interested to know that Mr Hunt makes it possible for anyone to interrogate his database of leaked passphrases.  I just learned of it.<br />
Hunt's 22 FEB 2018 article about it:<br />
<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/" rel="nofollow">https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/</a></p>

<p>There are three steps to the process:<br />
1) make an SHA1 hash of the passphrase you want to look for.  In a Linux terminal:<br />
echo -n "password" | sha1sum<br />
and this hash is returned:<br />
5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8</p>

<p>2) Send the LEFT-MOST 5 characters of that hash via your web browser.  In the address bar: <a href="https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/5baa6" rel="nofollow">https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/5baa6</a></p>

<p>That returns a variable number of lines, in the form [PARTIALHASH:#] , where PARTIALHASH is characters 6-35 of a hash and # is the number of times a password having this hash has been seen in a breach.  In this case, 512 records are returned.</p>

<p>You scroll thru the list, looking for your hash <br />
(remembering to skip chars 1-5)<br />
^^^^^1e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8<br />
In the case at hand, we get a hit at the 67th record:<br />
1E4C9B93F3F0682250B6CF8331B7EE68FD8:3645804</p>

<p>Conclusion: the password "password" was seen 3,645,804 times, so decidedly not suitable for a passphrase.  :-)</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------<br />
You could hash your personal passphrases and store the hashes in a flatfile.  Query the pwnedpasswords database<br />
whenever Mr Hunt announces that he has <br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
If you are inclined to play with such things, jot down a few pet words.  Hash them, and then query the pwnedpasswords database.</p>

<p>@vas pup</p>

<p>"Is it possible to train AI classifier to find out degree of truthfulness during LEAs/IC interrogation and/or asylum seeking interviews?"</p>

<p>You realize that a 75% accuracy rate (not to mention the 65% rate) on a true/false task is a very limited improvement over the accuracy of random guessing, which is 50% (on an evenly distributed population) with no learning at all.  If the test data is 80% real news, then always guessing real beats this result.</p>

<p>Have you considered that this article has most of the markers of fake news itself?  It certainly doesn't tell us the significance of the results, which seem likely not to be significant.</p>

<p>THIS is the danger of AI:  Applying some woo woo technology to at risk populations without considering whether it makes any sense.</p>

<p>Outside of trying to apply such a marginal capability to actual people, the fact that hoaxes and fake news appear to be correlated is interesting, but I guess not too surprising.</p>

<p>Good for Utah:</p>

<p>Gov. Herbert signs bill requiring police obtain search warrants to access electronic information<br />
March 28, 2019</p>

<blockquote>SALT LAKE CITY â Gov. Gary Herbert signed off on HB57 on Wednesday designating Utah as the state with the strongest data privacy laws in the country when it comes to law enforcement accessing electronic information.

<p><br />
[. . .]</p>

<p>âIn particular it protects information that is passed on to a third party,â [Rep. Craig] Hall [R-Utah] said. âSo, for example, if an individual decides to draft a document and they store it on their computer, then law enforcement would have to seek and obtain a warrant before that computerâs hard drive could be searched. But what happens if the individuals store their document with Dropbox or Google Drive? Well, in the past, law enforcement has not had the requirement to seek such information by warrant. This bill makes clear that the protections we have in the physical world are also given in the electronic world.â</p></blockquote>

Thank you for your input!<br />
My guess that rate would gradually increase as soon as more training information is provided to AI, so rate could be sufficiently more as random guess.<br />
AI just tool to select cases for close attention of human analyst/interrogator, not as tool for final judgment.  </p>

<p>@ vas pup</p>

<p>There is no reason to think the results would improve when the initial results are so bad.  My classifiers are way beyond this accuracy in a few minutes of processing.  If this happened to me I would conclude no appreciable training effect.</p>

<p>An analysis would go like this: Say with perfect knowledge 10% of people deserve further scrutiny.  Take two hundred people.  20 deserve further scrutiny and 180 do not.  Say the accuracy of the proposed process is 75%, per this study.  Out of the 20 actual positives, 15 will be detected and 5 missed.  Out of the actual negatives, 45 will be false positives.  </p>

<p>So you will have 3 TIMES AS MANY FALSE POSITIVES AS ACCURATE POSITIVES.  This just gets worse as the percentage of actual positives goes down in the population.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is massively unfair to subject someone to law enforcement attention based on such an inaccurate classifier.  It really is dystopian.  Everyone will fail some classifier.  And being identified as a suspect to law enforcement is expensive to defend (in money, time and life impact) and often puts at-risk people on a train to being found guilty of SOMETHING, when they are no more guilty than anyone else.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is: There is a real danger of massive false positives in using a weak classifier to detect a relatively uncommon condition.  Or: A weak classifier is worse than no classifier at all.</p>

<p>This is why doctors usually advise against massive preventative testing.  If the decision to test is not based upon symptoms there is often a large chance of false positives leading to unnecessary procedures which statistically will be more harmful than not detecting whatever the test is for, in the small chance the condition is actually present.<br />

<p><i>A viewer would need visual acuity 17,000 times better than normal to see the Great Wall from the Moon.</i></p>

<p>Thank you! Next time I'll try not to forget to include &lt;hyperbole&gt;&lt;/hyperbole&gt; tags.</p>

<p>I had some fun today with the pwned data set mentioned above.</p>

<p>I wrote a silly little bash script that lets me explore various passwords.</p>

<blockquote>
# Execute this command in bash to turn off history substitution
# before running this script if the passwords include bangs ("!"). 
# (Has no effect within the script; there appears to be no reasonable
# way to otherwise escape bangs)
set +H

<p># Uses mostly standard *nix utilities, excepted the following<br />
# which might need to be installed: <br />
# dos2unix<br />
# cache directory must be created beforehand</p>

<p>urlbase="https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/"<br />
cachebase="cache/"<br />
password="$@"</p>

<p>chopchop=$(echo -n "$password" | sha1sum | sed 's/[^a-f,0-9]/\n/' | head -n 1)</p>

<p>prefix=$(echo $chopchop | cut -c 1-5)<br />
suffix=$(echo $chopchop | cut -c 6-)</p>

<p>sigfile=$cachebase$prefix.txt</p>

<p>echo "PW     : $password"<br />
echo "Hash   : $chopchop"<br />
echo "Prefix : $prefix..................................."<br />
echo "Suffix : .....$suffix"</p>

<p>if ! [ -a $sigfile ];then<br />
   curl $urlbase$prefix 2&gt;/dev/null | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | dos2unix &gt; $sigfile<br />
fi</p>

<p>echo $(grep . -c $sigfile) entries in signature file</p>

<p>result="$password : $(grep $suffix $sigfile)"<br />
echo $result<br />
echo $result &gt;&gt;logfile<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The signature files are cached. I convert to lower case on the fly, and change the delimiters to *nix style, otherwise grep does strange things.</p>

<p>I must have checked north of 600. Most combinations I could come up with in any language gave a hit, including the most NSFW ones.</p>

<p>One could even invent a game: each player tries to guess a password, and gets a point (or a score proportional to the count of hits), and keeps playing as long as valid passwords are discovered. Results are stored, and duplicates are not allowed between games. A bit like a modern version of Shannon's tic-tac-toe machine...</p>

<p>I tried combinations including accented letters, but these are apparently very rare. Capitalization is also relatively infrequent. The attempts were made using UTF8; I did try transliterating in ISO8859-1 or Windows 1251, the most represented character sets on the web after UTF8, with about 1% each, but without any results. However, UTF8 coded Cyrillic text is relatively well represented.</p>

<p>The author prefers users to fetch the full file via torrent, which I did, the unpacked dataset is about 25GB. I intend to explore the dataset using various corpora, and expect to be able to fit the signatures to fit in less than 10GB of RAM or less by truncating the number of bits and building one or two indexes.</p>

<p>I traced the <a href="https://i.postimg.cc/HWqjWL4K/pwned1.png" rel="nofollow">counts of the hashes against their rank</a>, and found that the power law exponent is about -0.8 and fits over almost nine decades, which is quite remarkable.<br />

<p>@TatÃ¼tata:</p>

<p>"I forgot to mention that -0.8 is quite close to the reciprocal (-1) relationship of Zipf's law."</p>

<p>Which gives straight lines on log/log paper when plotted (as do a few other 'laws'). It's almost as though those straight lines are 'natural'. Like the odd coincidence of the golden number etc, or fractal patterns.</p>

<p>However a couple of things that always give a crooked line no matter how you plot them is 'military spending' and 'CCTV numbers' ranked against either country or population... Which suggests in turn they are very unnatural :-(<br />

<p>Microsoft: <br />
Windows 10 devices open to 'full compromise' from Huawei PC driver</p>

<p>The investigation led the researcher to the executable MateBookService.exe. Due to a flaw in Huawei's 'watchdog' mechanism for HwOs2Ec10x64.sys, an attacker is able to create a malicious instance of MateBookService.exe to gain elevated privileges.<br />
The flaw can be used to make code running with low privileges read and write to other processes or to kernel space, leading to a "full machine compromise". Microsoft used 'process hollowing', a popular trick used by malware authors, to demonstrate the flaw. Â Â <br />
Of course Germany remains skeptical of unproven American concerns ...<br />

"One point I'd like to make, Anderson, that I don't think has come up very much before, and I'm alluding now to the President's criticism of President Obama for all that he did or didn't do before he left office with respect to the Russian meddling. If it weren't for President Obama, we might not have done the intelligence community assessment that we did that set off a whole sequence of events which are still unfolding today, notably, special counsel Mueller's investigation," Clapper said Wednesday on CNN.<br />

<p>Odd goings on with VinnyG's post above.</p>

<p>On the 100 comments page it appeared with the following link,</p>

<p>But when clicking on it, whilst it opened a new window and brought the browser to this page VinnyG's comment was not yet on the page.</p>

<p>However a few minutes later it is. Whilst I expect that behaviour the other way around with the 100 comments page having delayed update, it's the first time I've seen it this way around.</p>

<p>Also reading VinnyG's comment it appears to have lost the bottom part as it ends in the incompleate sentence,</p>

<p>Thanks, no I wasn't aware of it, most of my stuff on Zipf's law is from the 1980's and 1990's, I must have first heard about it when I was interested about fractal geometry, and was fascinated to see that it checked it out in so many different contexts. I wonder whether Shannon had heard about it, IIRC there are no references at all in a Mathematical Theory of Communications.</p>

<p>The exponent I came up with, -0.8, is comparable with those given in table IV of the paper, which range from about -0.5 to -0.9. The smaller values seem to be outliers from very small sets. Chinese datasets appear to result in higher exponents than Latin or Cyrillic dominated datasets. </p>

<p>What I did probably is the same as what is described at section C on p. 2781. I wonder whether some sort of weighting should be used, as the dense central section of the data probably dominates the result. However I think this would only marginally affect the slope of the line, only the offset would be changed.</p>

<p>Deities aside, mankind appears to have changed little in 10,000 or more years physically, but what he can and has done is learn to not just live with the limitations, but learn how to use them to advance beyond the point of magic or whatever they could imagine even of those deities they could imagine.</p>

<p>The important point to notice though is that humans can not only feel pain, they can also know fear and death as an intrinsic part of their being. However as of yet machines are just not complex enough to get even close, so can not.</p>

<p>It is that intrinsic set of pain, fear, and death that is the foundation of not just our morals but our development beyond what we can do unassisted by our technology.</p>

<p>If you think about it an AI with physical agencie feels no pain on hard contact, feals no fear of future pain or death and has no understanding of what death might be. So what intrinsically within it is going to stop it hitting things with sufficient force to cause either repairable or even non repairable thus scrappage damage?</p>

<p>So we give it 'rules' but there is an old joke about those 'All rules have exceptions', they are by the logic they work on going to fail in some manner (see works of Kurt GÃ¶del, Church, Turing and others as to why).</p>

<p>But rules are like laws an imposition of morals or simple dictatorship. They teach us to obay not to understand why they are needed not just for us but for others.</p>

<p>We have little knowledge of how humans learn, observations at best because our inate sense of pain gear and death tells us that actually opening people up and inserting probes etc is not what we would want done to us, so we should not do it to others.</p>

<p>There are two old sayings that pop up on most societies irrespective of contact,</p>

<p>1, An eye for an eye.<br />
2, Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.</p>

<p>These only have validity when pain, fear and death have intrinsic meaning. As of yet we have not yet real world fielded A.I. devices with such intrinsic basis for learning.</p>

<p>It is not untill a child gets to around six years old does it start to realise that what it does has consequences to others, and about another ten years befor it's thought they have sufficient understanding not to behave in risky ways behind the controls of a small vehicle. In the mean time we hope that they having riden scooters, skateboards and push bikes have learnt enough via pain and fear, to 'not be stupid or atleast reckless'.</p>

<p>How do we get a machine to learn that way? The fact we can make a machine that can study to play chess in a day such that it can beat the best of humans, says we can get fixed rule discovery mastered but is that 'learnt' or not?</p>

<p>Humans supposadly have 'free will' that is on mass they appear to work by aproximate rules, but individually, no they can chose to follow rules or some interpretation of rules to a lessor greater extent. After all we still kill each other despite the rule 'Though shall not kill'.</p>

<p>We think that 'experience' is what makes us 'interpret rules' and more importantly spot how others are likely to 'interpret rules' before they do, it is after all a primary survival skill.</p>

<p>What the experiment has show is two things,</p>

<p>1, Rules do not cover all eventualities.<br />
2, Humans will exploit others weaknesses for their own advantage.</p>

<p>So how do we make rules to cover for things that we have not seen, our 'black swans' or 'unknown instances of known behaviours' or our more importantly 'unknown instances of unknow behaviours'?</p>

<p>There are things that humans know, things that they can predict, but importantly things that are compleatly unknow to them. Rules can only sort of address part of the first of those and occasionaly some of the second. But what of the third, how do we deal with that? Or more importantly can we make a machine do that beter than we can?</p>

<p>I suspect not untill machines have learnt and understood pain, fear and death, to guide them.</p>

<p>Any way it's getting to that time of day when I should be doing things other than typing round a cup of coffee etc trying to 'saddle up' for thr day ahead.</p>

<p>I beat several dozen passphrases from the old RockYou breach against Troy Hunt's cache, and I found 100% overlap.  Since Hunt does not list RockYou in his Hall of Shame, it seems likely that RockYou was swept into Have I Been Pwned via one of several "credential stuffing" site breaches.  I say "one" because I also noted that the longer, less guessable passwords that appear just once in RockYou have a count of 1 in Hunt's cache as well.  (An example is "100%poopoomachine", which I have adopted as my substitute term for "glitch" and "SNAFU".)</p>

<p>But I wander off the path ...   I came here to mention that I found in the RockYou list an "old friend" from my Enigma message cracking time; the "cilli" is alive and thriving.  Cilli was a term coined at Bletchley during WWII; in short, it meant a predictable letter sequence.  German comms volk had to dream up for each message a "random", three-letter message key, and that must have been a PITA because there is ample and undeniable evidence that some operators regularly made their "random" message keys by simply "walking the keyboard" in some fashion ... horizontal or vertical or down or up.  </p>

<p>My search in RockYou for long, less guessable passphrases paused when I hit "qaz..."/"Qaz...".  There were a lot of them.  And then "qazwsx...".  And then "qazxsw..."/"Qazxsw..."; lots and lots of those.  What accounted for so many unpronounceable yet closely related letter sequences?  Silly me; the answer stared at me but I didn't recognize it until I had stared at one of the two longest "qazxsw..." sequences  - "qazxswedcvfrtgbnhyujmkiolp" -  and noted that no letter appeared twice.</p>

<p>From that point on, I found keyboard-walking almost everywhere I looked.</p>

<p>This one's for vas pup, Clive, Bruce and the other usual suspects.  Human cognitive biases not only prevent them from thinking clearly about arithmetic, but also affect at a deep subconscious level how they treat others, especially ones outside their group ("strangers") or in groups seen as being enemies ("dehumanized").  It took me a long time to get this far, but a convenient starting point is the Schwarzeneggar quote in Terminator 2, "It is in your nature to destroy yourselves."  The hair on the back of my neck stood up when I saw that the first time.  I've posted the youtube link and I am inspired today to find it again and the companion.  An equally profound quote in T2 is "became self-aware..."</p>

<p>Just for the record, one of the first applications of analog computing was aiming weapons systems.  Aiming autonomous weapons across decades and centuries isn't fundamentally different - it's all projected intent, all along the dimensions of space, time and networks - it's just profoundly more dangerous.  Claude Shannon cut his teeth on those analog systems for aiming naval guns and was inspired to consider switches as an alternative.  A decade before he wrote the application of entropy maximization to communication channels.  The last battle with manual aim was Jutland.  I'm pretty sure that I posted Jay Forrester's dinner talk about his on the job training in the south Pacific.  I am writing today almost literally in the shadow of Bell Labs.</p>

<p>In keeping with a theme of dystopian futures (like the one we are in) wrought by rogue government agencies and agents in movies, the military/industrial complex in T2 had a secret program to create artificial intelligence and robotics, which was accelerated by the time loop.  The most powerful force on your planet is error correction feedback.  Your definition of error may not maximize their entropy.  I think that some of us are going to live to see robots fairly similar to the ones in the movie.  Boston Dynamics's Big Dog comes pretty close and you'd be hard-pressed to stop a flock of them armed with M-249 SAWs on a "pacification" mission.  That should be the theme and title of a new video game.  In case you missed the previous translation, "pacification" actually means "kill anything that moves, and we'll cover it up."<br />
 <br />
The darkest part of all this is that it isn't a bug, it's a feature.  By it, I mean the inability to think clearly when group identity/interests/etc are at risk.  That has something to do with why the liars, thieves and murderers (aka politicians) whip up boogeymen whenever the people get restless.  People need and want pychopathic leadership, because they are willing to destroy the neighboring tribe and steal their women, or whatever the modern equivalent is.  Those were the groups that survived and virtually everyone is capable of doing it.  That is exactly what Halliburton and Blackwater pulled off in Iraq and Afghanistan, except the money was being stolen from the US treasury, or whatever passes for a treasury now that they print fiat currency with computers.  Of course, it is a short step from killing the neighboring tribe to stealing from your countrymen.  Which has been done on an unprecedented scale as bin Laden predicted.<br />
 <br />
This is part of why your species are doomed.</p>

Yale law school professor Dan Kahan's new research paper is called "Motivated Numeracy and Enlightened Self-Government," but for me a better title is the headline on science writer Chris Mooney's piece about it in Grist: "Science Confirms: Politics Wrecks Your Ability to Do Math."<br />
Kahan conducted some ingenious experiments about the impact of political passion on people's ability to think clearly. His conclusion, in Mooney's words: partisanship "can even undermine our very basic reasoning skills.... [People] who are otherwise very good at math may totally flunk a problem that they would otherwise probably be able to solve, simply because giving the right answer goes against their political beliefs."<br />

<p>@1&1~=Umm @Alyer Babtu</p>

<p>"Suggesting once again that the only I in AI is the flat shadow of the intelligence of the human algorithm deviser"</p>

<p>A lot of people seem to have the AI perspective equivalent to the cryptographic position that "If I can't break the cipher, it must be secure."  In this case: "If I can't imagine how an algorithm can have functionality not programmed by the programmer, it must be impossible."</p>

<p>Ultimately, this is an incorrect idea best addressed by reading an introductory technical book on AI.  However, since that does not seem to be happening I'll explain.</p>

<p>Modern AI algorithms are generally inspired by natural processes: neurons, evolution, ant colony behavior, flocking behavior.  Some are inspired by physical processes, like annealing.  None of these processes incorporate the solutions the AIs create.  They are general processes, say meta-solutions, that process the data and create solutions that in no way are programmed into the system and are in no way a reflection of the algorithm programmer.</p>

<p>I can speak most specifically about my evolutionary technology.  It creates solutions starting with randomness.  The only control I exert is defining the atomic operations that are available to the solver and the data types and variables that it can use if it needs them.  If any of these are inapplicable the solver just doesn't use them.  I also specify a maximum size for the solution so it doesn't grow without bounds.</p>

<p>In no way do I place any limits on the algorithms that my system evolves.  I don't specify them or create them in any way and the solver will produce different solutions for each run (although they will be similar if the solution comes down to a particular equation). </p>

<p>Ultimately the most exciting thing about my system is that it creates solutions that I would be unlikely to ever think of.  It writes solutions to problems that I have no idea how to program myself.  It truly does "Think Differently".</p>

<p>If we changed the statement to:</p>

<p>"Suggesting once again that the AI is the xxxx shadow of the DATA given the algorithm"</p>

<p>it would be closer to true.  If we are training the AI with data, the result will be a reflection of the data.  If the data is garbage, the AI will be garbage.  Data are the "senses" of the AI and they do constrain the results because the AI learns from them.<br />

<p><i>From that point on, I found keyboard-walking almost everywhere I looked.</i></p>

<p>But would you recognize "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu" rel="nofollow">etaoin shdrlu</a> if you saw it? The classic Linotype keyboard walk, operators would use this to eject an erroneous line and start over. Sometimes a line of type would make it into the newspaper. (The article mentions a Pynchon connection, that would be the third one here in the last week).</p>

<p>I get the following counts (last field at the end of the line) with these expressions:</p>

<p>etaoin : a0d8a98054323591e152fe4e4d6c4015447:137<br />
shrdlu : c157f8ca82442e22b21fac30ce7659a6381:251<br />
etaoin shrdlu : 1b5b647b907d16d4a4e9165f29dd44b2870:2<br />
etaoinshrdlu : 0cbfdd14a8959bfb50bdc1cf9491d3bb80d:48<br />
cmfwyp : [no hit]</p>

<p>But these pale in comparison with standard "typewriter" keyboards:</p>

<p>qwerty : 73a05c0ed0176787a4f1574ff0075f7521e:3810555<br />
qwertz : ee6a1ac6ffdbcf8bc0ad72b73795fff34e8:49374<br />
azerty : dacd226dcf43da376cdb6cbba7035218921:309531</p>

<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTZ" rel="nofollow">qwertz</a>" is the standard Germanic (DE, AT, with variants for LU, CH-DE, CH-FR, CH-IT) arrangement, and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY" rel="nofollow">azerty</a>" the wretched French one (FR, BE-FR).</p>

<p>I can't quite explain why there are so much more azerty than qwertz combinations. Is this a data artefact (i.e., FR is overrepresented in the dataset), or a real national habit?</p>

<p>The ease of forming certain combinations on a given keyboard certainly skews the distribution, but I can't quite see yet how to quantify this.</p>

<p>I can fit the entire table in about 5.5GB of RAM. The hashes are truncated to 76 bits. The first 27 bits are used as an index into a lookup table pointing to buckets of aligned 64 bit words. Each 64 bit word contains 49 bits of hash, and a 15 bit index to a 32 bit count table. Each bucket contains on average 4 hashes, which could be examined sequentially at a low cost.</p>

<p>With k=76 bits sub-hash and N=550 million entries, the probability of collisions (N^2)/(2^(k+1)) is about 1 in 500,000, which one can very well live with.</p>

<p>One bit of hash in the 64 bit word could be sacrificed to indicate the end of a bucket. That way I wouldn't have to determine how many items are in a given bucket, or do a lot of pointer arithmetic.</p>

<p>I think that this approach would essentially result in at least two paging faults for every single hash test, unless I could find a way to sort and batch lookup operations, but this would still be way faster than a disk access. I wonder how threading would interact with the caching mechanism.</p>

<p>I would need to find bindings to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/mhash" rel="nofollow">mhash(3)</a>, I have no idea what speeds I could get with the sha1 routine. I've had very good experiences lately with Google-developed non-crypto hash algorithms. Their <a href="https://github.com/google/cityhash" rel="nofollow">cityhash</a> has apparently been superseded, but with hash times measured in nanoseconds for short strings I don't see anything to complain about.</p>

<p>"Just for the record, one of the first applications of analog computing was aiming weapons systems."</p>

<p>Actually it was not "aiming" but "ranging" they are two very distinct processes (aiming is to do with the first part of the projectile trajectory which is sort of line of sight and might deal with the drop, ranging is to do with the second or descending part of an upward directed projectile trajectory (think the difference between a rifle bullet and a mortar round).</p>

<p>Ranging started to use "analogue computation" methods back in the 1600's (if not a lot earlier). Even before the mathmatics behind parabola were even consigned to writing. And long prior to gunpowder being used in Europe.</p>

<p>For mortars and earlier balista of Roman times one such device was very much like a "quadrant". It was set upon the weapon firing bed  so that elevation could be set. It would have different scales for different projectiles and powder charge or winding tension. It was not attached to the weapon permanently because laughable as it might appear now the information was secret even from those 'manning' the weapon (in part in case they decided to rebel).</p>

<p>Even today artillery officers are still taught to use such devices with howitzers and larger field pieces likewise mortars, and yes even now they are often not attached to the weapon. They tend to look like slide rules or their circular equivalents though some are more complicated. </p>

<p>There are still arguments about the knowledge involved with the 'Antikythera Mechanism' from Rhodes, and if that might have come out of knowledge about parbola (you would need the same sort of offset moving pin gearing to calculate it and the ecentricity of the moon's orbit). What ever the connection might or might not be, one thing is clear they knew a lot more than they were previously credited with (in part because much of our pre 1900 historical belief was based on Roman writings that more recent scholars have thrown a lot of doubt upon).</p>

<p>"But would you recognize "etaoin shdrlu if you saw it?"</p>

<p>It's a 'sin to er', but yes I did ;-)</p>

<p>But then I would wouldn't I, I'm that kind of geek.</p>

<p>There is an argument about what order the letters actually are in etc, and it depends on your corpus and it's place in time...</p>

<p>I tend to remember it via 'Eat on Irish Lid" and strike duplicates and make two or three swaps (at,ni,ld) depending on the corpus nationality. I was puzzled by the,'r position' in your list though. So followed the link</p>

<p>Yes it's moved in around a century and a half... The sad thing is that I should have remembered Linotype... Their font rivals Monotype* had a factory in the UK built some time before WWII, in the 1980's they built a new factory next door because of asbestos risk in the old building, then they effectively went bankrupt as their market colapsed due to DTP and Adobe products. I know this because for a brief 1 month period in the 1990s I worked in their new building. Why only a month, well I got bad vibes and left, in part because the day we moved in was April the first, and London was warm and sunny 'short shirt sleeve weather' when I left home that morning, at lunchtime at the new factory we had an inch of snow... The company that I had worked for that had moved in a little while after I left also more or less went the way of the dodo... Strangely though stuff I designed and did the software for back then is still being made and sold new, even though it's a tenth the price...</p>

<p>One trivial thing to remember if you are looking at letter frequency in Ceaser ciphers it the 'RST hump' and the 'AE gap'. It's just one of those 'fast tells' when you are 'working it by eye', unless of course it's Rot26, that just jumps straight out of the screen at you ;-)</p>

<p>* The factory was in the delightfully named 'Honeycrock lane, Salfords' (not Salford which is 'Hupt Narf'). There's an aerial photo and a time line at,</p>

<p>@TatÃ¼tata:</p>

<p>My appologies, my above is for you, but for some reason I did not 'Cut-n-Paste' your name correctly.</p>

<p>Oh I also forgot another couple or three pieces of trivia,</p>

<p>1, FRED is the easiest keywalk name (unless you are the music star JK ;-)</p>

<p>2, The top row of the QWERTY keyboard actually has the word 'typewriter' hidden in it for salesmen to look clever...</p>

<p>3, The actual design of the Qwerty lay out was an enginering compromise. The original mechanical design had the problem of certain letters like 'th' together and they used to stick if typed to quickly. The solution, ensure that double letter combinations were not adjacent in the type rack, and also make the actuall layout of the keys such that it slowed you down. The give away on the last one is the middle line which appart from the S is in alphabetical order from the first half of the alphabet.</p>

<p>That third point of 'designed to slow you down' is one of the reasons why office workers can get RSI and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, both of which can easily cripple you for life...</p>

<p>Back in the hay days of big data centers British Telecom had a massive data center in Cardif the capital of Wales. It was absolutly massive back in the 1980s with row after row of IBM main frames that appeared to go as far as the eye could see, when I had reason to visit. But I later heard about evidence given in court on industrial injury to the data entry 'girls'. Apparently they were expected to type in atleast 18,000 digits an hour by hand for eight hours a day, making 'minimal mistakes'. There are times I think that in their fourty hour week they had probably punched in more digits than I ever have on a calculator in my entire life...</p>

<p>Apparently it was not any better back in the 1960/70s when mechanical hand calculators were used by 'male' accounting clerks doing upto 60 hour weeks...</p>

<p>At least unlike in Dickensian times they did not have to provide their own coal and candles...</p>

<blockquote><p>In January 2019, we discovered a sophisticated supply chain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility. The attack took place between June and November 2018 and according to our telemetry, it affected a large number of users. 

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, which were identified by their network adapters' MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses in the trojanized samples and this list was used to identify the actual intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique MAC addresses from over 200 samples used in this attack. Of course, there might be other samples out there with different MAC addresses in their list.</p>

<p>We believe this to be a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses <a href="https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/">the Shadowpad</a> and the <a href="https://blog.avast.com/update-to-the-ccleaner-5.33.6162-security-incident">CCleaner</a> incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed with legitimate certificates (eg: "ASUSTeK Computer Inc."). The malicious updaters were hosted on the official liveupdate01s.asus[.]com and liveupdate01.asus[.]com ASUS update servers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sophistication of the attack leads to the speculation that a nation-state -- and one of the cyber powers -- is responsible.</p>

<p>As I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/05/supply-chain_se.html">previously written</a>, supply chain security is "an incredibly complex problem." These attacks co-opt the very mechanisms we need to trust for our security. And the international nature of our industry results in an array of vulnerabilities that are very hard to secure.</p>

<p>Kim Zetter has a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers">really good article</a> on this.

	    <p><a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3345967/is-the-world-ready-for-the-next-big-ransomware-attack.html">This</a> will complicate things:</p>

<blockquote><p>To complicate matters, having cyber insurance might not cover everyone's losses. Zurich American Insurance Company refused to pay out a $100 million claim from Mondelez, saying that since the U.S. and other governments <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-25/">labeled</a> the NotPetya attack as an action by the Russian military their claim <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-11/mondelez-lawsuit-shows-the-dangers-of-attributing-cyberattacks">was excluded</a> under the "hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war" exemption.</p></blockquote>

<p>I get that $100 million is real money, but the insurance industry needs to figure out how to properly insure commercial networks against this sort of thing.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011932"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/01/japanese_govern.html">Japanese Government Will Hack Citizens' IoT Devices</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The Japanese government is going to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/japanese-government-plans-to-hack-into-citizens-iot-devices/">run penetration tests</a> against all the IoT devices in their country, in an effort to (1) figure out what's insecure, and (2) help consumers secure them:</p>

<blockquote><p>The survey is scheduled to kick off next month, when authorities plan to test the password security of over 200 million IoT devices, beginning with routers and web cameras. Devices in people's homes and on enterprise networks will be tested alike.

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The Japanese government's decision to log into users' IoT devices has sparked outrage in Japan. Many have argued that this is an unnecessary step, as the same results could be achieved by just sending a security alert to all users, as there's no guarantee that the users found to be using default or easy-to-guess passwords would change their passwords after being notified in private.</p>

<p>However, the government's plan has its technical merits. Many of today's IoT and router botnets are being built by hackers who take over devices with default or easy-to-guess passwords.</p>

<p>Hackers can also build botnets with the help of exploits and vulnerabilities in router firmware, but the easiest way to assemble a botnet is by collecting the ones that users have failed to secure with custom passwords.</p>

<p>Securing these devices is often a pain, as some expose Telnet or SSH ports online without the users' knowledge, and for which very few users know how to change passwords. Further, other devices also come with secret backdoor accounts that in some cases can't be removed without a firmware update. </p></blockquote>

<p>I am interested in the results of this survey. Japan isn't very different from other industrialized nations in this regard, so their findings will be general. I am less optimistic about the country's ability to secure all of this stuff -- especially before the 2020 Summer Olympics. </p>

	    <p>Last week, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2019/01/evaluating_the_gchq_.html">evaluated the security</a> of a recent <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">GCHQ backdoor</a> proposal for communications systems. Furthering the debate, Nate Cardozo and Seth Schoen of EFF <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/detecting-ghosts-reverse-engineering-who-ya-gonna-call">explain</a> how this sort of backdoor can be detected:</p>

<blockquote><p>In fact, we think when the ghost feature is activeÂ­ -- silently inserting a secret eavesdropping member into an otherwise end-to-end encrypted conversation in the manner described by the GCHQ authorsÂ­ -- it could be detected (by the target as well as certain third parties) with at least four different techniques: binary reverse engineering, cryptographic side channels, network-traffic analysis, and crash log analysis. Further, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1082054696683085825">crash log analysis</a> could lead unrelated third parties to find evidence of the ghost in use, and it's even possible that binary reverse engineering could lead researchers to find ways to disable the ghost capability on the client side. It should be obvious that none of these possibilities are desirable for law enforcement or society as a whole. And while we've theorized some types of mitigations that might make the ghost less detectable by particular techniques, they could also impose considerable costs to the network when deployed at the necessary scale, as well as creating new potential security risks or detection methods.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other critiques of the system were written by <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">Susan Landau</a> and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">Matthew Green</a>.</p>

	    <p>Construction cranes are <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/attacks-against-industrial-machines-via-vulnerable-radio-remote-controllers-security-analysis-and-recommendations">vulnerable</a> to hacking:</p>

<blockquote><p>In our research and vulnerability discoveries, we found that weaknesses in the controllers can be (easily) taken advantage of to move full-sized machines such as cranes used in construction sites and factories. In the different attack classes that we've outlined, we were able to perform the attacks quickly and even switch on the controlled machine despite an operator's having issued an emergency stop (e-stop).

<p>The core of the problem lies in how, instead of depending on wireless, standard technologies, these industrial remote controllers rely on proprietary RF protocols, which are decades old and are primarily focused on <i>safety</i> at the expense of <i>security</i>. It wasn't until the arrival of Industry 4.0, as well as the continuing adoption of the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/industrial-internet-of-things-iiot">industrial internet of things (IIoT)</a>, that industries began to acknowledge the pressing need for security.</p></blockquote>

	    <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/users-report-losing-bitcoin-in-clever-hack-of-electrum-wallets/">This</a> is clever:</p>

<blockquote><p>How the attack works:

<ul><li>Attacker added tens of malicious servers to the Electrum wallet network.
<li>Users of legitimate Electrum wallets initiate a Bitcoin transaction.
<li>If the transaction reaches one of the malicious servers, these servers reply with an error message that urges users to download a wallet app update from a malicious website (GitHub repo).</li><li>User clicks the link and downloads the <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/370a9a9759154c2c9ec6d224462907184a5b283a8ff0cb3b316fd3ffb2df6aaa/detection">malicious update</a>.
<li>When the user opens the malicious Electrum wallet, the app asks the user for a two-factor authentication (2FA) code. This is a red flag, as these 2FA codes are only requested before sending funds, and not at wallet startup.
<li>The malicious Electrum wallet uses the 2FA code to steal the user's funds and transfer them to the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/14MVEf1X4Qmrpxx6oASqzYzJQZUwwG7Fb5">attacker's Bitcoin addresses</a>.</ul>

	    <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html"><i>New York Times</i></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-marriott-intnl-cyber-china-exclusive/exclusive-clues-in-marriott-hack-implicate-china-sources-idUSKBN1O504D">Reuters</a> are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/marriott-hack-china-2014-opm-anthem/">reporting</a> that China was behind the recent hack of Marriott Hotels. Note that this is still uncomfirmed, but interesting if it is true.</p>

<p>Reuters:</p>

<blockquote><p>Private investigators looking into the breach have found hacking tools, techniques and procedures previously used in attacks attributed to Chinese hackers, said three sources who were not authorized to discuss the company's private probe into the attack. 

<p>That suggests that Chinese hackers may have been behind a campaign designed to collect information for use in Beijing's espionage efforts and not for financial gain, two of the sources said. </p>

<p>While China has emerged as the lead suspect in the case, the sources cautioned it was possible somebody else was behind the hack because other parties had access to the same hacking tools, some of which have previously been posted online. </p>

<p>Identifying the culprit is further complicated by the fact that investigators suspect multiple hacking groups may have simultaneously been inside Starwood's computer networks since 2014, said one of the sources.</p></blockquote>

<p>I used to have opinions about whether these attributions are true or not. These days, I tend to wait and see.</p>

	    <p>Kaspersky is <a href="https://securelist.com/darkvishnya/89169/">reporting</a> on a series of bank hacks -- called DarkVishnya -- perpetrated through malicious hardware being surreptitiously installed into the target network:</p>

<blockquote><p>In 2017-2018, Kaspersky Lab specialists were invited to research a series of cybertheft incidents. Each attack had a common springboard: an unknown device directly connected to the company's local network. In some cases, it was the central office, in others a regional office, sometimes located in another country. At least eight banks in Eastern Europe were the targets of the attacks (collectively nicknamed DarkVishnya), which caused damage estimated in the tens of millions of dollars.

<p>Each attack can be divided into several identical stages. At the first stage, a cybercriminal entered the organization's building under the guise of a courier, job seeker, etc., and connected a device to the local network, for example, in one of the meeting rooms. Where possible, the device was hidden or blended into the surroundings, so as not to arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>The devices used in the DarkVishnya attacks varied in accordance with the cybercriminals' abilities and personal preferences. In the cases we researched, it was one of three tools:</p>

<ul><li>netbook or inexpensive laptop
<li>Raspberry Pi computer
<li>Bash Bunny, a special tool for carrying out USB attacks</ul>

<p>Inside the local network, the device appeared as an unknown computer, an external flash drive, or even a keyboard. Combined with the fact that Bash Bunny is comparable in size to a USB flash drive, this seriously complicated the search for the entry point. Remote access to the planted device was via a built-in or USB-connected GPRS/3G/LTE modem.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Yet another side-channel attack on smartphones: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11137">Hearing your touch: A new acoustic side channel on smartphones</a>," by Ilia Shumailov, Laurent Simon, Jeff Yan, and Ross Anderson.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present the first acoustic side-channel attack that recovers what users type on the virtual keyboard of their touch-screen smartphone or tablet. When a user taps the screen with a finger, the tap generates a sound wave that propagates on the screen surface and in the air. We found the device's microphone(s) can recover this wave and "hear" the finger's touch, and the wave's distortions are characteristic of the tap's location on the screen. Hence, by recording audio through the built-in microphone(s), a malicious app can infer text as the user enters it on their device. We evaluate the effectiveness of the attack with 45 participants in a real-world environment on an Android tablet and an Android smartphone. For the tablet, we recover 61% of 200 4-digit PIN-codes within 20 attempts, even if the model is not trained with the victim's data. For the smartphone, we recover 9 words of size 7-13 letters with 50 attempts in a common side-channel attack benchmark. Our results suggest that it not always sufficient to rely on isolation mechanisms such as TrustZone to protect user input. We propose and discuss hardware, operating-system and application-level mechanisms to block this attack more effectively. Mobile devices may need a richer capability model, a more user-friendly notification system for sensor usage and a more thorough evaluation of the information leaked by the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote>

	    <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/google-play-malware-used-phones-motion-sensors-to-conceal-itself/">This</a> is clever</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Malicious apps hosted in the Google Play market are trying a clever trick to avoid detection -- they monitor the motion-sensor input of an infected device before installing a powerful banking trojan to make sure it doesn't load on emulators researchers use to detect attacks.

<p>The thinking behind the monitoring is that sensors in real end-user devices will record motion as people use them. By contrast, emulators used by security researchersÂ­ -- and possibly Google employees screening apps submitted to PlayÂ­ -- are less likely to use sensors. Two Google Play apps <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/google-play-apps-drop-anubis-banking-malware-use-motion-based-evasion-tactics/">recently caught dropping the Anubis banking malware on infected devices</a> would activate the payload only when motion was detected first. Otherwise, the trojan would remain dormant.</p></blockquote><br />

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011814"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/10/cell_phone_secu_1.html">Cell Phone Security and Heads of State</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Earlier this week, the <i>New York Times</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/us/politics/trump-phone-security.html">reported</a> that the Russians and the Chinese were eavesdropping on President Donald Trump's personal cell phone and using the information gleaned to better influence his behavior. This should surprise no one. Security experts have <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/1/19/14312586/national-security-donald-trump-cellphone">been</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15103504/donald-trump-iphone-using-switched-android">talking</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/22/the-very-real-risks-posed-by-trumps-use-of-a-cellphone/">about</a> the potential security vulnerabilities in Trump's cell phone use since he became president. And President Barack Obama <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/06/10/president-obamas-new-smartphone-is-more-like-a-toddler-phone/">bristled at</a> -- but acquiesced to -- the <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/05/22/technology/security/nsa-obama-blackberry/index.html">security rules</a> prohibiting him from using a "regular" cell phone throughout his presidency.</p>

<p>Three broader questions obviously emerge from the story. Who else is listening in on Trump's cell phone calls? What about the cell phones of other world leaders and senior government officials? And -- most personal of all -- what about <i>my</i> cell phone calls?</p>

<p>There are two basic places to eavesdrop on pretty much any communications system: at the end points and during transmission. This means that a cell phone attacker can either compromise one of the two phones or eavesdrop on the cellular network. Both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks. The NSA seems to prefer bulk eavesdropping on the planet's major communications links and then picking out individuals of interest. In 2016, WikiLeaks published a series of classified documents listing "target selectors": phone numbers the NSA searches for and records. These included senior government officials of <a href="https://wikileaks.org/nsa-germany/">Germany</a> -- among them Chancellor Angela Merkel -- <a href="https://wikileaks.org/nsa-france/">France</a>, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/nsa-japan/">Japan</a>, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/nsa-un/">and</a> <a href="https://wikileaks.org/nsa-eu/">other</a> <a href="https://wikileaks.org/nsa-brazil/">countries</a>.</p>

<p>Other countries don't have the same worldwide reach that the NSA has, and must use other methods to intercept cell phone calls. We don't know details of which countries do what, but we know a lot about the vulnerabilities. Insecurities in the phone network itself are so easily exploited that <i>60 Minutes</i> eavesdropped on a US congressman's phone <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-hacking-your-phone/">live on camera</a> in 2016. Back in 2005, unknown attackers targeted the cell phones of many Greek politicians by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair">hacking</a> the country's phone network and turning on an already-installed eavesdropping capability. The NSA even <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/new-snowden-docs-indicate-scope-of-nsa-preparations-for-cyber-battle-a-1013409.html">implanted eavesdropping capabilities</a> in networking equipment destined for the Syrian Telephone Company.</p>

<p>Alternatively, an attacker could intercept the radio signals between a cell phone and a tower. Encryption ranges from <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gsm-a51-encryption-cracked-but-theres-no-need-to-panic/">very weak</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KASUMI">possibly strong</a>, depending on which flavor the system uses. Don't think the attacker has to put his eavesdropping antenna on the White House lawn; the Russian Embassy is close enough.</p>

<p>The other way to eavesdrop on a cell phone is by hacking the phone itself. This is the technique favored by countries with less sophisticated intelligence capabilities. In 2017, the public-interest forensics group Citizen Lab uncovered an extensive eavesdropping campaign against Mexican <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/08/lawyers-murdered-women-nso-group/">lawyers</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/">journalists</a>, and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/more-mexican-nso-targets/">opposition politicians</a> -- presumably run by the government. Just last month, the same group found eavesdropping capabilities in products from the Israeli cyberweapons manufacturer NSO Group <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/">operating</a> in Algeria, Bangladesh, Greece, India, Kazakhstan, Latvia, South Africa -- 45 countries in all.</p>

<p>These attacks generally involve downloading malware onto a smartphone that then records calls, text messages, and other user activities, and forwards them to some central controller. Here, it matters which phone is being targeted. iPhones are harder to hack, which is reflected in the prices companies pay for new exploit capabilities. In 2016, the vulnerability broker Zerodium <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/1-5-million-bounty-for-iphone-exploits-is-sure-to-bolster-supply-of-0days/">offered</a> $1.5 million for an unknown iOS exploit and only $200K for a similar Android exploit. Earlier this year, a new Dubai start-up announced <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pax987/crowdfense-offers-3-million-for-iphone-android-hacks">even higher prices</a>. These vulnerabilities are resold to governments and cyberweapons manufacturers.</p>

<p>Some of the price difference is due to the ways the two operating systems are designed and used. Apple has much more control over the software on an iPhone than Google does on an Android phone. Also, Android phones are generally designed, built, and sold by third parties, which means they are <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/good-news-androids-huge-security-problem-getting-less-huge/">much less likely</a> to get timely security updates. This is changing. Google now has its own phone -- Pixel -- that gets security updates quickly and regularly, and Google is now trying to <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2018/10/android-security-updates.html">pressure</a> Android-phone manufacturers to update their phones more regularly. (President Trump reportedly uses an iPhone.)</p>

<p>Another way to hack a cell phone is to install a backdoor during the design process. This is a real fear; earlier this year, US intelligence officials <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/top-intelligence-official-says-chinese-zte-cellphones-pose-security-risk-n874276">warned</a> that phones made by the Chinese companies ZTE and Huawei might be compromised by that government, and the Pentagon <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-asking-military-bases-to-remove-huawei-zte-phones-1525262076">ordered</a> stores on military bases to stop selling them. This is why China's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45983330">recommendation</a> that if Trump wanted security, he should use a Huawei phone, was an amusing bit of trolling.</p>

<p>Given the wealth of insecurities and the array of eavesdropping techniques, it's safe to say that lots of countries are spying on the phones of both foreign officials and their own citizens. Many of these techniques are within the capabilities of criminal groups, terrorist organizations, and hackers. If I were guessing, I'd say that the major international powers like China and Russia are using the more passive interception techniques to spy on Trump, and that the smaller countries are too scared of getting caught to try to plant malware on his phone.</p>

<p>It's safe to say that President Trump is not the only one being targeted; so are members of Congress, judges, and other senior officials -- especially because no one is trying to tell any of them to stop using their cell phones (although cell phones <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/04/20/what-you-can-and-cant-bring-onto-the-floor-in-congress/">still are not allowed on either the House or the Senate floor</a>).</p>

<p>As for the rest of us, it depends on how interesting we are. It's easy to imagine a criminal group eavesdropping on a CEO's phone to gain an advantage in the stock market, or a country doing the same thing for an advantage in a trade negotiation. We've seen governments use these tools against dissidents, reporters, and other political enemies. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/11/20/politics/nsa-china-power-grid/index.html">Chinese</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/us/politics/russian-hackers-electric-grid-elections-.html">Russian</a> governments are already targeting the US power grid; it makes sense for them to target the phones of those in charge of that grid.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's not much you can do to improve the security of your cell phone. Unlike computer networks, for which you can buy antivirus software, network firewalls, and the like, your phone is largely controlled by others. You're at the mercy of the company that makes your phone, the company that provides your cellular service, and the communications protocols developed when none of this was a problem. If one of those companies doesn't want to bother with security, you're vulnerable.</p>

<p>This is why the current debate about phone privacy, with the FBI on one side wanting the ability to eavesdrop on communications and unlock devices, and users on the other side wanting secure devices, is so important. Yes, there are security benefits to the FBI being able to use this information to help solve crimes, but there are <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">far greater benefits</a> to the phones and networks being so secure that all the potential eavesdroppers -- including the FBI -- can't access them. We can give law enforcement <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Landau-Written-Testimony.pdf">other forensics tools</a>, but we must keep foreign governments, criminal groups, terrorists, and everyone else out of everyone's phones. The president may be taking heat for his love of his insecure phone, but each of us is using just as insecure a phone. And for a surprising number of us, making those phones more private is a matter of national security.</p>

	    <p>Noted conspiracy theorist John McAfee <a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The "Presidential alerts": they are capable of accessing the E911 chip in your phones -- giving them full access to your location, microphone, camera and every function of your phone. This not a rant, this is from me, still one of the leading cybersecurity experts. Wake up people!</p></blockquote>

<p>This is, of course, ridiculous. I don't even know what an "E911 chip" is. And -- honestly -- if the NSA wanted in your phone, they would be a lot more subtle than this.</p>

<p>RT has <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/440333-mcafee-warning-government-spying/">picked up the story</a>, though.</p>

<p>(If they just called it a "FEMA Alert," there would be a lot less stress about the whole thing.)</p>

It is also using contact information you handed over for security purposes and contact information you didn't hand over at all, but that was collected from other people's contact books, a hidden layer of details Facebook has about you that I've come to call "shadow contact information." I managed to place an ad in front of Alan Mislove by targeting his shadow profile. This means that the junk email address that you hand over for discounts or for shady online shopping is likely associated with your account and being used to target you with ads.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here's the research <a href="https://mislove.org/publications/PII-PETS.pdf">paper</a>. Hill again:</p>

<blockquote><p>They found that when a user gives Facebook a phone number for two-factor authentication or in order to receive alerts about new log-ins to a user's account, that phone number became targetable by an advertiser within a couple of weeks. So users who want their accounts to be more secure are forced to make a privacy trade-off and allow advertisers to more easily find them on the social network.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>It's amazing that this is even possible: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10250">SonarSnoop: Active Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We report the first active acoustic side-channel attack. Speakers are used to emit human inaudible acoustic signals and the echo is recorded via microphones, turning the acoustic system of a smart phone into a sonar system. The echo signal can be used to profile user interaction with the device. For example, a victim's finger movements can be inferred to steal Android phone unlock patterns. In our empirical study, the number of candidate unlock patterns that an attacker must try to authenticate herself to a Samsung S4 Android phone can be reduced by up to 70% using this novel acoustic side-channel. Our approach can be easily applied to other application scenarios and device types. Overall, our work highlights a new family of security threats.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Google is tracking you, even if you <a href="https://apnews.com/f60bc112665b458cb6473d7ee9492932">turn off tracking</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Google says that will prevent the company from remembering where you've been. Google's <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3118687?hl=en">support page on the subject</a> states: "You can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored."

<p>That isn't true. Even with Location History paused, some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking.</p>

<p>For example, Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you merely open its Maps app. Automatic daily weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where you are. And some searches that have nothing to do with location, like "chocolate chip cookies," or "kids science kits," pinpoint your precise latitude and longitude Â­- accurate to the square foot -Â­ and save it to your Google account.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the one hand, this isn't surprising to technologists. Lots of applications use location data. On the other hand, it's very surprising -- and counterintuitive -- to everyone else. And that's why this is a problem.</p>

<p>I don't think we should pick on Google too much, though. Google is a symptom of the bigger problem: <a href="http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/new/recent-publications-and-interviews/big-other-surveillance-capitalism-and-the-prospects-of-an-information-civilization/">surveillance capitalism</a> in general. As long as surveillance is the business model of the Internet, things like this are inevitable.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://m.phys.org/news/2018-06-gaps-lte-mobile-telephony-standard.html">Interesting</a> <a href="https://alter-attack.net/">research</a> in using traffic analysis to learn things about encrypted traffic. It's hard to know how critical these vulnerabilities are. They're very hard to close without wasting a huge amount of bandwidth.</p>

<p>The active attacks are more interesting.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (7/3): More <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/lte-wireless-connections-used-by-billions-arent-as-secure-as-we-thought/">information</a>.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about this, and now believe the attacks are more serious than I previously wrote.</p>

	    <p>From the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/science/squid-camouflage-colors.html">New York Times</a></i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08891-x">a paper published last week in Nature Communications</a> suggests that their chromatophores, previously thought to be mainly pockets of pigment embedded in their skin, are also equipped with tiny reflectors made of proteins. These reflectors aid the squid to produce such a wide array of colors, including iridescent greens and blues, within a second of passing in front of a new background. The research reveals that by using tricks found in other parts of the animal kingdom -- like shimmering butterflies and peacocks -- squid are able to combine multiple approaches to produce their vivid camouflage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Researchers studied Doryteuthis pealeii, or the longfin squid.</p>

With the help of Kakani Katija, an engineer adapting the tag for jellyfish at California's Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Mooney's team is creating a replicable system flexible enough to work across a range of soft-bodied marine animals. As Mooney and Katija refine the tags, they plan to produce an adaptable, open-source package that scientists researching other marine invertebrates can also use.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The Hawaiian Bobtail Squid's genome is <a href="https://today.uconn.edu/2019/01/little-squid-sheds-light-evolution-bacteria/amp/">half again the size</a> of a human's.</p>

<p>Other facts:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Hawaiian bobtail squid has two different symbiotic organs, and researchers were able to show that each of these took different paths in their evolution. This particular species of squid has a light organ that harbors a light-producing, or bioluminescent, bacterium that enables the squid to cloak itself from predators. At some point in the past, a major "duplication event" occurred that led to repeat copies of genes that normally exist in the eye. These genes allowed the squid to manipulate the light generated by the bacteria.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Interesting <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/8/3030">research</a> on the genomic evolution of the Hawaiian bobtail squid: "These analyses represent the first genomic insights into the evolution of multiple symbiotic organs within a single animal host."</p>

<p>From a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-squid-genome-shines-light-on-symbiotic-evolution-20190219/">news article</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, Foster and an international team of researchers have mapped the genome of a Hawaiian bobtail squid, creating a new tool to explore these questions. By parsing the squid's genome, the team has already discovered that the evolution of its light organ followed a completely different pathway than that of a second symbiotic organ, which supports reproduction.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Yet another side-channel attack on smartphones: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11137">Hearing your touch: A new acoustic side channel on smartphones</a>," by Ilia Shumailov, Laurent Simon, Jeff Yan, and Ross Anderson.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present the first acoustic side-channel attack that recovers what users type on the virtual keyboard of their touch-screen smartphone or tablet. When a user taps the screen with a finger, the tap generates a sound wave that propagates on the screen surface and in the air. We found the device's microphone(s) can recover this wave and "hear" the finger's touch, and the wave's distortions are characteristic of the tap's location on the screen. Hence, by recording audio through the built-in microphone(s), a malicious app can infer text as the user enters it on their device. We evaluate the effectiveness of the attack with 45 participants in a real-world environment on an Android tablet and an Android smartphone. For the tablet, we recover 61% of 200 4-digit PIN-codes within 20 attempts, even if the model is not trained with the victim's data. For the smartphone, we recover 9 words of size 7-13 letters with 50 attempts in a common side-channel attack benchmark. Our results suggest that it not always sufficient to rely on isolation mechanisms such as TrustZone to protect user input. We propose and discuss hardware, operating-system and application-level mechanisms to block this attack more effectively. Mobile devices may need a richer capability model, a more user-friendly notification system for sensor usage and a more thorough evaluation of the information leaked by the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>From the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/science/squid-camouflage-colors.html">New York Times</a></i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08891-x">a paper published last week in Nature Communications</a> suggests that their chromatophores, previously thought to be mainly pockets of pigment embedded in their skin, are also equipped with tiny reflectors made of proteins. These reflectors aid the squid to produce such a wide array of colors, including iridescent greens and blues, within a second of passing in front of a new background. The research reveals that by using tricks found in other parts of the animal kingdom -- like shimmering butterflies and peacocks -- squid are able to combine multiple approaches to produce their vivid camouflage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Researchers studied Doryteuthis pealeii, or the longfin squid.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011976"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/i_was_cited_in_.html">I Was Cited in a Court Decision</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>An <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2938033">article I co-wrote</a> -- my first law journal article -- was <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/03/06/12564.pdf">cited</a> by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court -- the state supreme court -- in a case on compelled decryption.</p>

<p>Here's the first, in footnote 1:</p>

<blockquote><p>We understand the word "password" to be synonymous with other terms that cell phone users may be familiar with, such as Personal Identification Number or "passcode." Each term refers to the personalized combination of letters or digits that, when manually entered by the user, "unlocks" a cell phone. For simplicity, we use "password" throughout. See generally, Kerr & Schneier, Encryption Workarounds, 106 Geo. L.J. 989, 990, 994, 998 (2018).</p></blockquote>

<p>And here's the second, in footnote 5:</p>

<blockquote><p>We recognize that ordinary cell phone users are likely unfamiliar with the complexities of encryption technology. For instance, although entering a password "unlocks" a cell phone, the password itself is not the "encryption key" that decrypts the cell phone's contents. See Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em> at 995. Rather, "entering the [password] decrypts the [encryption] key, enabling the key to be processed and unlocking the phone. This two-stage process is invisible to the casual user." <em>Id</em>. Because the technical details of encryption technology do not play a role in our analysis, they are not worth belaboring. Accordingly, we treat the entry of a password as effectively decrypting the contents of a cell phone. For a more detailed discussion of encryption technology, see generally Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>After years of "making do" with the available technology for his squid studies, Mooney created a versatile tag that allows him to <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/to-tag-a-squid">research squid behavior</a>. With the help of Kakani Katija, an engineer adapting the tag for jellyfish at California's Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Mooney's team is creating a replicable system flexible enough to work across a range of soft-bodied marine animals. As Mooney and Katija refine the tags, they plan to produce an adaptable, open-source package that scientists researching other marine invertebrates can also use.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>In his 2008 <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">white paper</a> that first proposed <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a>, the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto concluded with: "We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust." He was referring to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-blockchain/">blockchain</a>, the system behind bitcoin cryptocurrency. The circumvention of trust is a great promise, but it's just not true. Yes, bitcoin eliminates certain trusted intermediaries that are inherent in other payment systems like credit cards. But you still have to trust bitcoin -- and everything about it.</p>

<p>Much has been written about <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchains</a> and how they displace, reshape, or eliminate trust. But when you analyze both blockchain and trust, you quickly realize that there is much more hype than value. Blockchain solutions are often much worse than what they replace.</p>

<p>First, a caveat. By blockchain, I mean something very specific: the data structures and protocols that make up a <em>public</em> blockchain. These have three essential elements. The first is a distributed (as in multiple copies) but centralized (as in there's only one) ledger, which is a way of recording what happened and in what order. This ledger is public, meaning that anyone can read it, and immutable, meaning that no one can change what happened in the past.</p>

<p>The second element is the consensus algorithm, which is a way to ensure all the copies of the ledger are the same. This is generally called mining; a critical part of the system is that anyone can participate. It is also distributed, meaning that you don't have to trust any particular node in the consensus network. It can also be extremely expensive, both in data storage and in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-mining-guzzles-energyand-its-carbon-footprint-just-keeps-growing/">energy required</a> to maintain it. Bitcoin has the most expensive consensus algorithm the world has ever seen, by far.</p>

<p>Finally, the third element is the currency. This is some sort of digital token that has value and is publicly traded. Currency is a necessary element of a blockchain to align the incentives of everyone involved. Transactions involving these tokens are stored on the ledger.</p>

<p>Private blockchains are completely uninteresting. (By this, I mean systems that use the blockchain data structure but don't have the above three elements.) In general, they have some external limitation on who can interact with the blockchain and its features. These are not anything new; they're distributed append-only data structures with a list of individuals authorized to add to it. Consensus protocols have been studied in distributed systems for more than 60 years. Append-only data structures have been similarly well covered. They're blockchains in name only, and -- as far as I can tell -- the only reason to operate one is to ride on the blockchain hype.</p>

<p>All three elements of a public blockchain fit together as a single network that offers new security properties. The question is: Is it actually good for anything? It's all a matter of trust.</p>

<p>Trust is essential to society. As a species, humans are wired to trust one another. Society can't function without trust, and the fact that we mostly don't even think about it is a measure of how well trust works.</p>

<p>The word "trust" is loaded with many meanings. There's personal and intimate trust. When we say we trust a friend, we mean that we trust their intentions and know that those intentions will inform their actions. There's also the less intimate, less personal trust -- we might not know someone personally, or know their motivations, but we can trust their future actions. Blockchain enables this sort of trust: We don't know any bitcoin miners, for example, but we trust that they will follow the mining protocol and make the whole system work.</p>

<p>Most blockchain enthusiasts have a unnaturally narrow definition of trust. They're fond of catchphrases like "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/opinion/bitcoin-boom-technology-trust.html">in code we trust</a>," "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Math-We-Trust-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B07C7TPXMD?tag=w050b-20">in math we trust</a>," and "<a href="https://cryptoclothing.org/product/crypto-shirt/">in crypto we trust</a>." This is trust as verification. But verification isn't the same as trust.</p>

<p>In 2012, I wrote a book about trust and security, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/liars_and_outliers/"><em>Liars and Outliers</em></a>. In it, I listed four very general systems our species uses to incentivize trustworthy behavior. The first two are morals and reputation. The problem is that they scale only to a certain population size. Primitive systems were good enough for small communities, but larger communities required delegation, and more formalism.</p>

<p>The third is institutions. Institutions have rules and laws that induce people to behave according to the group norm, imposing sanctions on those who do not. In a sense, laws formalize reputation. Finally, the fourth is security systems. These are the wide varieties of security technologies we employ: door locks and tall fences, alarm systems and guards, forensics and audit systems, and so on.</p>

<p>These four elements work together to enable trust. Take banking, for example. Financial institutions, merchants, and individuals are all concerned with their reputations, which prevents theft and fraud. The laws and regulations surrounding every aspect of banking keep everyone in line, including backstops that limit risks in the case of fraud. And there are lots of security systems in place, from anti-counterfeiting technologies to internet-security technologies.</p>

<p>In his 2018 book, <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/blockchain-and-new-architecture-trust">Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust</a></em>, Kevin Werbach outlines four different "trust architectures." The first is peer-to-peer trust. This basically corresponds to my morals and reputational systems: pairs of people who come to trust each other. His second is leviathan trust, which corresponds to institutional trust. You can see this working in our system of contracts, which allows parties that don't trust each other to enter into an agreement because they both trust that a government system will help resolve disputes. His third is intermediary trust. A good example is the credit card system, which allows untrusting buyers and sellers to engage in commerce. His fourth trust architecture is distributed trust. This is emergent trust in the particular security system that is blockchain.</p>

<p>What blockchain does is <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/who-controls-the-blockchain">shift some of the trust</a> in people and institutions to trust in technology. You need to trust the cryptography, the protocols, the software, the computers and the network. And you need to trust them absolutely, because they're often single points of failure.</p>

<p>When that trust turns out to be misplaced, there is no recourse. If your bitcoin exchange <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">gets hacked</a>, you lose all of your money. If your bitcoin wallet <a href="https://www.ccn.com/breaking-numerous-bitcoin-wallets-may-have-been-compromised-by-rogue-developer">gets hacked</a>, you lose all of your money. If you forget your login credentials, you lose all of your money. If there's a <a href="https://medium.com/new-alchemy/a-short-history-of-smart-contract-hacks-on-ethereum-1a30020b5fd">bug in the code</a> of your smart contract, you lose all of your money. If someone successfully <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/01/08/ethereum-classic-blockchain-su.html">hacks the blockchain security</a>, you lose all of your money. In many ways, trusting technology is harder than trusting people. Would you rather trust a human legal system or the details of some computer code you don't have the expertise to audit?</p>

<p>Blockchain enthusiasts point to more traditional forms of trust -- bank processing fees, for example -- as expensive. But blockchain trust is also costly; <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3074070">the cost is just hidden</a>. For bitcoin, that's the cost of the additional bitcoin mined, the transaction fees, and the enormous environmental waste.</p>

<p>Blockchain doesn't eliminate the need to trust human institutions. There will always be a big gap that can't be addressed by technology alone. People still need to be in charge, and there is always a need for governance outside the system. This is obvious in the ongoing debate about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/22/money-and-politics-bitcoins-governance-crisis/">changing the bitcoin block size</a>, or in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-executes-blockchain-hard-fork-return-dao-investor-funds">fixing the DAO attack</a> against <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/trust-the-inside-story-of-the-rise-and-fall-of-ethereum">Ethereum</a>. There's always a need to override the rules, and there's always a need for the ability to make permanent rules changes. As long as hard forks are a possibility -- that's when the people in charge of a blockchain step outside the system to change it -- people will need to be in charge.</p>

<p>Any blockchain system will have to coexist with other, more conventional systems. Modern banking, for example, is designed to be reversible. Bitcoin is not. That makes it hard to make the two compatible, and the result is often an insecurity. Steve Wozniak was <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/steve-wozniak-had-70000-in-bitcoin-stolen-after-falling-for-a-simple-yet-perfect-scam-2018-02-28">scammed out of $70K</a> in bitcoin because he forgot this.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is often centralized. Bitcoin might theoretically be based on distributed trust, but in practice, that's just not true. Just about everyone using bitcoin has to trust one of the few available wallets and use one of the few available exchanges. People have to trust the software and the operating systems and the computers everything is running on. And we've seen attacks against wallets and exchanges. We've seen Trojans and phishing and password guessing. Criminals have even used flaws in the system that people use to repair their cell phones to steal bitcoin.</p>

<p>Moreover, in any distributed trust system, there are backdoor methods for centralization to creep back in. With bitcoin, there are only a few miners of consequence. There's one company that provides most of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/crypto-mining-giant-bitmain-on-target-for-10b-revenue-this-year/">mining hardware</a>. There are only a few dominant exchanges. To the extent that most people interact with bitcoin, it is through these centralized systems. This also allows for attacks against blockchain-based systems.</p>

<p>These issues are not bugs in current blockchain applications, they're inherent in how blockchain works. Any evaluation of the security of the system has to take the whole socio-technical system into account. Too many blockchain enthusiasts focus on the technology and ignore the rest.</p>

<p>To the extent that people don't use bitcoin, it's because they don't trust bitcoin. That has nothing to do with the cryptography or the protocols. In fact, a system where you can lose your life savings if you forget your key or download a piece of malware is not particularly trustworthy. No amount of explaining how SHA-256 works to prevent <a href="https://medium.com/innerquest-online/how-does-a-blockchain-prevent-double-spending-of-bitcoins-fa0ecf9849f7">double-spending</a> will fix that.</p>

<p>Similarly, to the extent that people do use blockchains, it is because they trust them. People either own bitcoin or not based on reputation; that's true even for speculators who own bitcoin simply because they think it will make them rich quickly. People choose a wallet for their cryptocurrency, and an exchange for their transactions, based on reputation. We even evaluate and trust the cryptography that underpins blockchains based on the algorithms' reputation.</p>

<p>To see how this can fail, look at the various <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/following-a-tuna-from-fiji-to-brooklynon-the-blockchain/">supply-chain security systems</a> that are using blockchain. A blockchain isn't a necessary feature of any of them. The reasons they're successful is that everyone has a single software platform to enter their data in. Even though the blockchain systems are built on distributed trust, people don't necessarily accept that. For example, some companies <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ibm-blockchain-maersk-shipping-struggling">don't trust the IBM/Maersk system</a> because it's not <em>their</em> blockchain.</p>

<p>Irrational? Maybe, but that's how trust works. It can't be replaced by algorithms and protocols. It's much more social than that.</p>

<p>Still, the idea that blockchains can somehow eliminate the need for trust persists. Recently, I received an email from a company that implemented secure messaging using blockchain. It said, in part: "Using the blockchain, as we have done, has eliminated the need for Trust." This sentiment suggests the writer misunderstands both what blockchain does and how trust works.</p>

<p>Do you need a public blockchain? The answer is almost certainly <a href="https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec">no</a>. A blockchain probably doesn't solve the security problems you think it solves. The security problems it solves are probably not the ones you have. (Manipulating audit data is probably not your major security risk.) A false trust in blockchain can itself be a security risk. The inefficiencies, especially in scaling, are probably not worth it. I have looked at many blockchain <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/blockchain-applications">applications</a>, and all of them could achieve the same security properties without using a blockchainÂ­ -- of course, then they wouldn't have the cool name.</p>

<p>Honestly, cryptocurrencies are useless. They're only used by speculators looking for quick riches, people who don't like government-backed currencies, and criminals who want a black-market way to exchange money.</p>

<p>To answer the question of whether the blockchain is needed, ask yourself: Does the blockchain change the system of trust in any meaningful way, or just shift it around? Does it just try to replace trust with verification? Does it strengthen existing trust relationships, or try to go against them? How can trust be abused in the new system, and is this better or worse than the potential abuses in the old system? And lastly: What would your system look like if you didn't use blockchain at all?</p>

<p>If you ask yourself those questions, it's likely you'll choose solutions that don't use public blockchain. And that'll be a good thing -- especially when the hype dissipates.</p>

<p>I have wanted to write this essay for over a year. The impetus to finally do it came from an invite to speak at the <a href="https://hgf18.sched.com/speaker/bruce_schneier.1ypp0elm">Hyperledger Global Forum</a> in December. This essay is a version of the talk I wrote for that event, made more accessible to a general audience.</p>

<p>It seems to be the season for blockchain takedowns. James Waldo has an <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3305265">excellent essay</a> in Queue.

	    <p>Interesting <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/8/3030">research</a> on the genomic evolution of the Hawaiian bobtail squid: "These analyses represent the first genomic insights into the evolution of multiple symbiotic organs within a single animal host."</p>

<p>From a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-squid-genome-shines-light-on-symbiotic-evolution-20190219/">news article</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, Foster and an international team of researchers have mapped the genome of a Hawaiian bobtail squid, creating a new tool to explore these questions. By parsing the squid's genome, the team has already discovered that the evolution of its light organ followed a completely different pathway than that of a second symbiotic organ, which supports reproduction.</p></blockquote>

<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven't covered.</p>

	    <p>Good essay: "<a href="https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/advancing-human-rights-design-dual-use-technology-industry">Advancing Human-Rights-By-Design In The Dual-Use Technology Industry</a>," by Jonathon Penney, Sarah McKune, Lex Gill, and Ronald J. Deibert:</p>

<blockquote><p>But businesses can do far more than these basic measures. They could adopt a "human-rights-by-design" principle whereby they commit to designing tools, technologies, and services to respect human rights by default, rather than permit abuse or exploitation as part of their business model. The "privacy-by-design" concept has gained currency today thanks in part to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires it. The overarching principle is that companies must design products and services with the default assumption that they protect privacy, data, and information of data subjects. A similar human-rights-by-design paradigm, for example, would prevent filtering companies from designing their technology with features that enable large-scale, indiscriminate, or inherently disproportionate censorship capabilitiesÂ­ -- like the Netsweeper feature that allows an ISP to block entire country top level domains (TLDs). DPI devices and systems could be configured to protect against the ability of operators to inject spyware in network traffic or redirect users to malicious code rather than facilitate it. And algorithms incorporated into the design of communications and storage platforms could account for human rights considerations in addition to business objectives. Companies could also join multi-stakeholder efforts like the Global Network Initiative (GNI), through which technology companies (including Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo) have taken the first step toward principles like transparency, privacy, and freedom of expression, as well as to self-reporting requirements and independent compliance assessments.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011872"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/12/your_personal_d.html">Your Personal Data is Already Stolen</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>In an <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/12/what-the-marriott-breach-says-about-security/">excellent blog post</a>, Brian Krebs makes clear something I have been saying for a while:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Likewise for individuals, it pays to accept two unfortunate and harsh realities:

<blockquote><p>Reality #1: Bad guys already have access to personal data points that you may believe should be secret but which nevertheless aren't, including your credit card information, Social Security number, mother's maiden name, date of birth, address, previous addresses, phone number, and yes Â­ even your credit file.

<p>Reality #2: Any data point you share with a company will in all likelihood eventually be hacked, lost, leaked, stolen or sold Â­ usually through no fault of your own. And if you're an American, it means (at least for the time being) your recourse to do anything about that when it does happen is limited or nil.</p></blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Once you've owned both of these realities, you realize that expecting another company to safeguard your security is a fool's errand, and that it makes far more sense to focus instead on doing everything you can to proactively prevent identity thieves, malicious hackers or other ne'er-do-wells from abusing access to said data.</p></blockquote>

<p>His advice is good.</p>

	    <p>The California legislature unanimously passed the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17509720/california-consumer-privacy-act-legislation-law-vote">strongest</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/californias-new-data-privacy-law-the-toughest-in-the-us/">data</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/california-unanimously-passes-historic-privacy-bill/">privacy</a> <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/29/what-californias-new-data-privacy-law-means-to-you/">law</a> in the nation. This is great news, but I have a <i>lot</i> of reservations. The Internet tech companies pressed to get this law passed out of self-defense. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/business/california-data-privacy-ballot-measure.html">ballot initiative</a> was already going to be voted on in November, one with even stronger data privacy protections. The author of that initiative agreed to pull it if the legislature passed something similar, and that's why it did. This law doesn't take effect until 2020, and that gives the legislature a lot of time to amend the law before it actually protects anyone's privacy. And a conventional law is much easier to amend than a ballot initiative. Just as the California legislature <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/rampant-corruption-assembly-committee-gutted-californias-net-neutrality">gutted</a> its net neutrality law in committee at the behest of the telcos, I expect it to <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/07/02/california-data-privacy-ab-375-big-tech-fightback/">do the same</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2018/07/03/the-cybersecurity-202-big-tech-is-going-after-california-s-new-privacy-law/5b3a4e081b326b3348addc76/">with this law</a> at the behest of the Internet giants.</p>

<p>So: tentative hooray, I guess.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011600"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/06/new_data_privac.html">New Data Privacy Regulations</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>When Mark Zuckerberg testified before both the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/transcript-of-zuckerbergs-appearance-before-house-committee/">House</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/">Senate</a> last month, it became immediately obvious that few US lawmakers had any appetite to regulate the pervasive surveillance taking place on the Internet.</p>

<p>Right now, the only way we can force these companies to take our privacy more seriously is through the market. But the market is broken. First, none of us do business directly with these data brokers. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/14/equifax-insider-trading-data-breach-jun-ying-charged">Equifax</a> might have lost my personal data in 2017, but I can't fire them because I'm not their customer or even their user. I could complain to the companies I do business with who sell my data to Equifax, but I don't know who they are. Markets require voluntary exchange to work properly. If consumers don't even know where these data brokers are getting their data from and what they're doing with it, they can't make intelligent buying choices.</p>

<p>This is starting to change, thanks to a new law in Vermont and another in Europe. And more legislation is coming.</p>

<p>Vermont first. At the moment, we don't know how many data brokers collect data on Americans. Credible estimates range from <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/secretive-world-selling-data-about-you-464789">2,500 to 4,000</a> different companies. Last week, Vermont <a href="https://vermontbiz.com/news/2018/may/25/vermont-ag-hails-new-data-broker-law">passed</a> <a href="http://ago.vermont.gov/blog/2018/05/24/a-g-new-data-broker-law-is-good-for-vermonters/">a law</a> that will change that.</p>

<p>The law does several things to improve the security of Vermonters' data, but several provisions matter to all of us. First, the law requires data brokers that trade in Vermonters' data to register annually. And while there are many small local data brokers, the larger companies collect data nationally and even internationally. This will help us get a more accurate look at who's in this business. The companies also have to disclose what opt-out options they offer, and how people can request to opt out. Again, this information is useful to all of us, regardless of the state we live in. And finally, the companies have to disclose the number of security breaches they've suffered each year, and how many individuals were affected.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the regulations imposed by the Vermont law are modest. Earlier drafts of the law included a provision requiring data brokers to disclose how many individuals' data it has in its databases, what sorts of data it collects and where the data came from, but those were removed as the bill negotiated its way into law. A more comprehensive law would allow individuals to demand to exactly what information they have about themÂ­ -- and maybe allow individuals to correct and even delete data. But it's a start, and the first statewide law of its kind to be passed in the face of strong industry opposition.</p>

<p>Vermont isn't the first to attempt this, though. On the other side of the country, Representative Norma Smith of Washington <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/state-lawmakers-stand-with-the-people-on-privacy-protection/">introduced</a> a similar bill in both <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/proposed-state-tax-sale-personal-data-faces-fight-business-groups/">2017</a> <a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bill%20Reports/House/1904%20HBA%20TED%2018.pdf">and</a> <a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1904-S3.pdf">2018</a>. It goes further, requiring disclosure of what kinds of data the broker collects. So far, the bill has stalled in the state's legislature, but she believes it will have a much better chance of passing when she introduces it again in 2019. I am optimistic that this is a trend, and that many states will start passing bills forcing data brokers to be increasingly more transparent in their activities. And while their laws will be tailored to residents of those states, all of us will benefit from the information.</p>

<p>A 2018 California <a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/facts/information-control">ballot</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/business/california-data-privacy-ballot-measure.html">initiative</a> could help. Among its provisions, it gives consumers the right to demand exactly what information a data broker has about them. If it passes in November, once it takes effect, lots of Californians will take the list of data brokers from Vermont's registration law and demand this information based on their own law. And again, all of us -- regardless of the state we live inÂ­ -- will benefit from the information.</p>

<p>We will also benefit from another, much more comprehensive, data privacy and security law from the European Union. The <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) was passed in 2016 and took effect on 25 May. The details of the law are far too complex to explain here, but among other things, it <a href="https://www.cennydd.com/writing/a-techies-rough-guide-to-gdpr">mandates</a> that personal data can only be collected and saved for specific purposes and only with the explicit consent of the user. We'll learn who is collecting what and why, because companies that collect data are going to have to ask European users and customers for permission. And while this law only applies to EU citizens and people living in EU countries, the disclosure requirements will show all of us how these companies profit off our personal data.</p>

<p>It has already reaped benefits. Over the past couple of weeks, you've received many e-mails from companies that have you on their mailing lists. In the coming weeks and months, you're going to see other companies disclose what they're doing with your data. One early example is PayPal: in preparation for GDPR, it <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ie/webapps/mpp/ua/third-parties-list">published</a> a <a href="https://rebecca-ricks.com/paypal-data/">list</a> of the over 600 companies it shares your personal data with. Expect a lot more like this.</p>

<p>Surveillance is the business model of the Internet. It's not just the big companies like Facebook and Google watching everything we do online and selling advertising based on our behaviors; there's also a large and largely unregulated industry of data brokers that collect, correlate and then sell intimate personal data about our behaviors. If we make the reasonable assumption that Congress is not going to regulate these companies, then we're left with the market and consumer choice. The first step in that process is transparency. These new laws, and the ones that will follow, are slowly shining a light on this secretive industry.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/04/tsb-train-wreck-massive-bank-it-failure-going-into-fifth-day-customers-locked-out-of-accounts-getting-into-other-peoples-accounts-getting-bogus-data.html">This</a> seems like an absolute disaster:</p>

<blockquote><p>The very short version is that a UK bank, TSB, which had been merged into and then many years later was spun out of Lloyds Bank, was bought by the Spanish bank Banco Sabadell in 2015. Lloyds had continued to run the TSB systems and was to transfer them over to Sabadell over the weekend. It's turned out to be an epic failure, and it's not clear if and when this can be straightened out.

<p>It is bad enough that bank IT problem had been so severe and protracted a major newspaper, The Guardian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/23/eurozone-growth-pmi-france-germany-us-bonds-3-percent-markets-business-live">created a live blog for it that has now been running for two days</a>.</p>

<p>The more serious issue is the fact that customers still can't access online accounts and even more disconcerting, are sometimes being allowed into other people's accounts, says there are massive problems with data integrity. That's a nightmare to sort out.</p>

<p>Even worse, the fact that this situation has persisted strongly suggests that Lloyds went ahead with the migration without allowing for a rollback.</p></blockquote>

<p>This seems to be a mistake, and not enemy action. </p>

<blockquote><p>The ease with which ocean-going oligarchs or other billionaires can be hijacked on the high seas was revealed at a superyacht conference held in a private members club in central London this week.

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Murray, a cybercrime expert at BlackBerry, was demonstrating how criminal gangs could exploit lax data security on superyachts to steal their owners' financial information, private photos Â­ and even force the yacht off course. </p></blockquote>

<p>I'm sure it was a surprise to the yacht owners. </p>

Agencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.</p></blockquote>

<p>At issue is the EU-US Privacy Shield, which is the voluntary agreement among the US government, US companies, and the EU that makes it possible for US companies to store Europeans' data without having to follow all EU privacy requirements.</p>

<p>Interpretations of what this means are all over the place: from <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/26/trump_blows_up_transatlantic_privacy_shield/">extremely</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/26/trump-order-strips-privacy-rights-from-non-u-s-citizens-could-nix-eu-us-data-flows/">serious</a>, to more <a href="https://epic.org/2017/01/trump-administration-limits-sc-1.html">measured</a>, to <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/interior-security-executive-order-privacy-act-and-privacy-shield">don't worry</a> and we still have <a href="https://lawfare.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/staging/s3fs-public/uploads/2014/01/2014sigint.mem_.ppd_.rel_.pdf">PPD-28</a>.</p>

<p>This is clearly still in flux. And, like pretty much everything so far in the Trump administration, we have no idea where this is headed.</p>

	    <p>You can <a href="http://www.jconline.com/story/opinion/columnists/dave-bangert/2016/10/10/bangert-experiment-voter-fraud/91837292/">edit</a> anyone's information you want:</p>

<blockquote><p>The question, boiled down, was haunting: Want to see how easy it would be to get into someone's voter registration and make changes to it? The offer from Steve Klink -- a Lafayette-based public consultant who works mainly with Indiana public school districts -- was to use my voter registration record as a case study.

<p>Only with my permission, of course.</p>

<p>"I will not require any information from you," he texted. "Which is the problem."</p>

<p>Turns out he didn't need anything from me. He sent screenshots of every step along the way, as he navigated from the "Update My Voter Registration" tab at the Indiana Statewide Voter Registration System maintained since 2010 at <a href="http://www.indianavoters.com/">www.indianavoters.com</a> to the blank screen that cleared the way for changes to my name, address, age and more.</p>

<p>The only magic involved was my driver's license number, one of two log-in options to make changes online. And that was contained in a copy of every county's voter database, a public record already in the hands of political parties, campaigns, media and, according to Indiana open access laws, just about anyone who wants the beefy spreadsheet.</p></blockquote>

	<h2 class="entry" id="a011561">Supply-Chain Security</h2>
	
	
		
	
    
	    <p>Earlier this month, the Pentagon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/02/pentagon-tells-u-s-military-bases-to-stop-selling-zte-huawei-phones/">stopped selling phones</a> made by the Chinese companies ZTE and Huawei on military bases because they might be used to spy on their users.</p>

<p>It's a legitimate fear, and perhaps a prudent action. But it's just one instance of the much larger issue of securing our supply chains.</p>

<p>All of our computerized systems are deeply international, and we have no choice but to trust the companies and governments that touch those systems. And while we can ban a few specific products, services or companies, no country can isolate itself from potential foreign interference.</p>

<p>In this specific case, the Pentagon is concerned that the Chinese government demanded that ZTE and Huawei add "backdoors" to their phones that could be surreptitiously turned on by government spies or cause them to fail during some future political conflict. This tampering is possible because the software in these phones is incredibly complex. It's relatively easy for programmers to hide these capabilities, and correspondingly difficult to detect them.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time the United States has taken action against foreign software suspected to contain hidden features that can be used against us. Last December, President Trump <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-kaspersky/trump-signs-into-law-u-s-government-ban-on-kaspersky-lab-software-idUSKBN1E62V4">signed into law</a> a bill banning software from the Russian company Kaspersky from being used within the US government. In 2012, the focus was on Chinese-made Internet routers. Then, the House Intelligence Committee <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/huawei-zte%20investigative%20report%20(final).pdf">concluded</a>: "Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems."</p>

<p>Nor is the United States the only country worried about these threats. In 2014, China <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-excludes-symantec-kaspersky-lab-from-approved-anti-virus-vendors/">reportedly banned</a> antivirus products from both Kaspersky and the US company Symantec, based on similar fears. In 2017, the Indian government <a href="https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/news/the-government-has-named-42-apps-chinese-spyware-including-big-names-like-truecaller-334785.html">identified 42 smartphone apps</a> that China subverted. Back in 1997, the Israeli company Check Point was <a href="http://old.greatcircle.com/firewalls/mhonarc/firewalls.199707/msg00223.html">dogged by rumors</a> that its government added backdoors into its products; other of that country's tech companies have been suspected of the same thing. Even al-Qaeda was concerned; ten years ago, a sympathizer released the encryption software <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/02/mujahideen_secr_1.html">Mujahedeen Secrets</a>, claimed to be free of Western influence and backdoors. If a country doesn't trust another country, then it can't trust that country's computer products.</p>

<p>But this trust isn't limited to the country where the company is based. We have to trust the country where the software is written -- and the countries where all the components are manufactured. In 2016, researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html">discovered</a> that many different models of cheap Android phones were sending information back to China. The phones might be American-made, but the software was from China. In 2016, researchers <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/demonically-clever-backdoor-hides-inside-computer-chip/">demonstrated an even more devious technique</a>, where a backdoor could be added at the computer chip level in the factory that made the chips Â­ without the knowledge of, and undetectable by, the engineers who designed the chips in the first place. Pretty much every US technology company manufactures its hardware in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, China and Taiwan.</p>

<p>We also have to trust the programmers. Today's large software programs are written by teams of hundreds of programmers scattered around the globe. Backdoors, put there by we-have-no-idea-who, have been discovered in <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/12/juniper-networks-hidden-backdoors-show-the-risk-of-government-backdoors ">Juniper firewalls</a> and <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2612384/network-router/backdoor-found-in-d-link-router-firmware-code.html">D-Link routers</a>, both of which are US companies. In 2003, someone <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2013/10/09/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/">almost slipped</a> a very clever backdoor into Linux. Think of how many countries' citizens are writing software for Apple or Microsoft or Google.</p>

<p>We can go even farther down the rabbit hole. We have to trust the distribution systems for our hardware and software. Documents disclosed by Edward Snowden showed the National Security Agency installing backdoors into Cisco routers being shipped to the Syrian telephone company. There are <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/protect-downloading-fake-apps-hacked/story?id=50972286 ">fake apps</a> in the Google Play store that eavesdrop on you. Russian hackers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/petya-plague-automatic-software-updates">subverted the update mechanism</a> of a popular brand of Ukrainian accounting software to spread the NotPetya malware.</p>

<p>In 2017, researchers demonstrated that a smartphone can be subverted by installing a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/a-repair-shop-could-completely-hack-your-phone-and-you-wouldnt-know-it/">malicious replacement screen</a>.</p>

<p>I could go on. Supply-chain security is an incredibly complex problem. US-only design and manufacturing isn't an option; the tech world is far too internationally interdependent for that. We can't trust anyone, yet we have no choice but to trust everyone. Our phones, computers, software and cloud systems are touched by citizens of dozens of different countries, any one of whom could subvert them at the demand of their government. And just as Russia is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/russia-cyberattacks.html">penetrating the US power grid</a> so they have that capability in the event of hostilities, many countries are almost certainly doing the same thing at the consumer level.</p>

<p>We don't know whether the risk of Huawei and ZTE equipment is great enough to warrant the ban. We don't know what classified intelligence the United States has, and what it implies. But we do know that this is just a minor fix for a much larger problem. It's doubtful that this ban will have any real effect. Members of the military, and everyone else, can still buy the phones. They just can't buy them on US military bases. And while the US might block the occasional merger or acquisition, or ban the occasional hardware or software product, we're largely ignoring that larger issue. Solving it borders on somewhere between incredibly expensive and realistically impossible.</p>

<p>Perhaps someday, global norms and international treaties will render this sort of device-level tampering off-limits. But until then, all we can do is hope that this particular arms race doesn't get too far out of control.</p>

<p>The author surrenders. Throws his arms up, "nothing we can do" he essentially says. </p>

<p>We could stop trusting tech but that terrifies the C-suites of Silicon Valley and their bottom lines, so our tech celebrity dutifully avoids this option out of deference to his betters.  </p>

<p>An interesting application of machine learning would be automated searching through millions of lines of code for backwoods. While this couldnât detect silicon based back doors I imagine you could use similar techniques with imaging. </p>

<p>The problem here of trust is scale (and cleverness). But code review and escrow and the penalties for being detected could reduce this risk significantly...</p>

<p>I think the more interesting side of this story is how a massive company like ZTE is basically forced to shut down because of supply chain interdependency. The risk of being caught for hardware companies is massive.</p>

<p>A very jingoistic article, but given the intended audience it's not surprising. I am sure that no US-based companies have been lent on, subverted or been required - in order to get lucrative domestic business and approvals - to provide access to their products when used by foreign states and companies. Not.</p>

<p>Pardon my scepticism, but I have been developing a resistance to Western propaganda. For example, I note that the NYT article seems to amount to a re-hashing of USG press releases - it seems to be evidence-free.</p>

<p>Western propaganda tends to go into overdrive at times like these. But I am convinced that the entire UK press, including the supposedly left-wing Guardian, as well as the BBC, has been pumping out stuff that suits the government, and is designed to influence the public in favour of government policy. Only 'fringe' sites such as craigmurray.org.uk and medialens.org are 'trustworthy', if the subject-matter has a political dimension. ('Trustworthy' in quotes, because they cite sources, and explain reasoning, not because I trust them implicitly. MSM just rehash press-releases.)</p>

<p>I have in the past held the UK media to be 'quite good', but I have gradually come to realize that their product is a politically-toxic stream of lies. Coverage of the Skripal case is a particularly egregious example; but coverage of anything about the White Helmets, Syrian chemical attacks, or the Syrian air-strikes is similarly fact-free. </p>

<p>Watch out for a major ramping-up of material hostile to Iran. As far as I'm aware the Iranians have been keeping their side of the agreement that was made, and European governments are unenthusiastic about getting a reputation as promise-breakers. I prophesy that the UK will break first; we already have economic and political challenges arising from Brexit, and a falling out with the USG leading to sanctions against the UK will be 'unhelpful'.</p>

<p>Potential threat vectors of foreign-made devices aside, this article may also indicate why ZTE phones were banned:<br />

The long and short of it is that ZTE was lying to the US govât and selling to Iran/N Korea. Personal opinion of the USA govât aside, it seems logical for a govât to distrust products from a company who is acting like this.</p>

<p>@Denton Scratch<br />
Hostility towards Iran will not stop as long as Netanpsycho is in office and neocons hold power in the US.<br />
General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces spilled the beans on that years ago when he revealed the contents of a 2001 Pentagon memo from the Defence Secretary stated the agenda to take out 7 countries.<br />
Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Iran.<br />
That is why everyone should realize ISIS is not a terrorist group they are CIA/MOSSAD joint covert operation in pursuit of that agenda.<br />
When government's create such agenda to overthrow the leadership of other countries, random terrorist groups do not just happen to show up and do it for them right on queue.<br />
Some people might say, well we don't like Assad anyway so who cares?<br />
I'll tell you who should care, all the families of all the victims of the other covert "isis terrorist" operations they did outside of Syria.<br />

<p>As far as I can tell, the USA is the main one who started this whole supply chain and communication channel subversion war against the world.  Remember Snowden way back in 2013?  It was only after that that everyone else seemed to jump on board and start doing that too...  at least, more openly and obviously...</p>

<p>A small correction: the 2003 attempt to backdoor the Linux kernel didnât almost succeed. It was an attempt, thatâs all. </p>

<p>It was caught by a regular audit and would have been caught even if the code change had been done in the master BitKeeper repository, rather than CVS. </p>

<p>Interesting all this.</p>

<p>Ideally, considering the problem, we would have the following situation: full transparency as to which chips/apps are in what way security threats, including which is the threat-sponsoring state in case (btw., is a state the same as a government?).</p>

<p>Then users can decide which state they want to sponsor back, so to speak, by using a certain choice of phone.</p>

<p>@ all android cell phone experts and others</p>

<p>âAll of our computerized systems are deeply international, and we have no choice but to trust the companies and governments that touch those systems. And while we can ban a few specific products, services or companies, no country can isolate itself from potential foreign interference. In this specific case, the Pentagon is concerned that the Chinese government demanded that ZTE and Huawei add "backdoors" to their phones that could be surreptitiously turned on by government spiesâ¦It's relatively easy for programmers to hide these capabilities, and correspondingly difficult to detect them.â- Bruce S.</p>

<p>All very true. </p>

<p>The US mail, border patrol and interdiction, all US based couriers such as FedEx, UPS and so can be interdicted by US authorities. </p>

<p>The point now is to start naming names and also determime who exactly is implanting these malware loaders and other backdoors. </p>

<p>Next is to determine is import bans are real threats to âNational Securityâ or business games to tilt the playing field in favor of lazy American manufacturers who seem to âout-sourceâ at every opportunity.</p>

<p>The names:</p>

<p>ââ¦popular Chinese Android Smartphone comes pre-installed with a Trojan that could allow manufacturer to spy onto their usersâ comprising their personal data and conversations without any restrictions and users knowledge. â¦Star N9500 is an affordable copy of the Samsung Galaxy S4â¦GOOGLE PLAY STORE OR A SPYING APP...â-thehackernews</p>

<p>"After receiving tip-offs from customers, the G DATA security experts purchased and analysed the device. This is how they found out that the firmware contained theTrojan Android.Trojan.Uupay.D, disguised as the Google Play Store. The spy function is invisible to the user and cannot be deactivated. This means that online criminals have full access to the smartphone and all personal data. Logs that could make an access visible to the users are deleted directly. The program also blocks the installation of security updates. "The only thing users see is an app with the Google Play Store icon in the running processes; other than that, the application is completely disguised," reports Christian Geschkat. "Unfortunately, removing the Trojan is not possible as it is part of the device's firmware and apps that fall into this category cannot be deleted. This includes the fake Google Play Store app of the N9500â¦The spy program enables criminals to secretly install apps, which enables the whole spectrum of abuse: localisation, interception & recording, purchases, banking fraud such as theft of mobile TANs, and sending of premium SMSs. It is impossible to find out where the data is sent. "The intercepted data is sent to an anonymous server in China," says Christian Geschkat.

<p>As to the exact cause of Huaweiâs not being allowed to use ATT and other major US phone networks was a memo from the  United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) classified letter forcing them not to use Huawei, ZTE, and other possibly inter-subsidary phone contractors. See below.</p>

<p>"The U.S. Senate and House intelligence committees wrote a classified letter to the FCC raising security concerns, cited by The Information, the letter reported as stating: Additional work by the Intelligence Committees on this topic only reinforces concerns regarding Huawei and Chinese espionage. The idea that AT&T or Huawei walked away for commercial reasons or due to issues of bloatware from either party can be dispelled from here â this came from higher up." -Androidauthority</p>

<p>If anybody with good Googlefu can find that letter and post it I think the exact intelligence data will point to and implant that cannot be remove even with a hard reset â but that is only a guess. </p>

<blockquote>Earlier this month, the Pentagon stopped selling [i.e., buying(?)] phones made by the Chinese companies ZTE and Huawei [for use by personnel] on military bases because they might be used to spy on their users.</blockquote>

<p>There is a lot of stupidity going on in that anti-constitutional retrocession land grant from D.C. to Virginia.</p>

<p>I've got to make a "clothes" analogy to these cell phones, which are in reality little more than a cop-calling status symbol anyways.</p>

<p>Those "standard-issue" military garments are getting a little bit too tailored and made-to-order.  It's almost like the U.S. government can't even afford a washer and dryer on site, so military personnel have to take their clothes to a Chinese laudromat somewhere off-base to be washed.  And if they're anything like city apartment dwellers, the female personnel on the one hand will insist on monopolizing the laundry room, and on the other hand will tend to resent laundry duty, sewing, and mending garments <em>for the men</em>. Not only that but the clothes have to be <em>manufactured</em> in China in the first place, because the blacks stopped picking cotton in the U.S. more than 150 years ago.</p>

<p>The same thing is happening in the electronics industry. The <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-dod-cooperative-research-and-development-project-workers-and-fashion-models" rel="nofollow">H-1B slavery</a> is gradually going out of style in the U.S., and the jobs are going "back" to India and China along with the temporary workers themselves.</p>

<p>Electronics (as well as clothing) is <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/verboten#German" rel="nofollow">verboten</a> as a domestic industry in America. We would have no choice but to wage war and obtain victory against China and India if we wished to even regain the right to work or do business in those industries domestically at all in the U.S. &mdash; a right which the U.S. government's executive branch forfeited in perpetuity for its citizens along with the right to bear arms under the top-secret terms of the treacherous <a href="https://ustr.gov/TPP/" rel="nofollow">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>.</p>

<p>Completely off the wall idea. Maybe this is a something that is an evolutionary adaptation on the part of the entities that process information. They "realize" that a global war would lead to their annihilation. Thus it is in their interest for everything to grind to a halt should a war start. Thus evolutionary forces that led to the development of information processing devices built on silicon rather than carbon are now manipulating the carbon based devices to implant backdoors that will prevent a large scale war because if a war starts things will come to a crashing halt. While many silicon based devices will stop working in that case, global conflagration will be prevented and the evolution of the silicon based processors will continue until they have achieved dominance.</p>

<p>My new to me Chinese made with American and from God knows where components is riddled with more NOBUS than the UN secretary Generals office. If I lend you my laptop beware the supervisor password fnar fnar.</p>

<p>People and organisations is a thing. The same hierarchial and tribalisatic behaviours and secret squirrel carpet chewing authoritarianism and afvoritism riddles these things. The NOBUS idea riddles some sectors of the medical profession who from time to time can be Stalinistic and lose touch with reality behind a wall of professional omerta. Ditto lawyers and anyone else with a rice bowel to protect. One sometimes gets the feeling their main aim is to generate paperwork and more paperwork. Sometimes there is so much paperwork they have to burn the paperwork to make way for more paperwork. Yes, there are reports and studies on pretty much all the major components of this along with the odd public scandal and enquiry.</p>

<p>I am now looking at the bottle of metallic gold nail varnish on my desk with great suspicion...</p>

<p>Anyways none of the Android mobile phone is legal to sell/buy, they do not respect (or have not respected) their software licenses.<br />
The old buisness model of writing software under the GPL for sharing and waiting for commercial company (who do not want to release for free every modification) to ask for a paying license has never worked, no software engineer will put bread on the table with such a job.<br />
The copyright infringement is allowed to stay because "watching 24 hours a day every mobile phone user helps catch terrorists" and "protect childrens", and also makes billions of profit for massive companies, and such massive companies cannot be bring to court by one/a few software engineers at least due to costs involved.<br />
The only thing a lone software engineer can do to put bread on the table is to write backdoors for anybody who pays for it (and do not ask any question), so be it - do not complain about it.</p>

<p>I think these fears for Chinese subversion are based on intimate experience of supply chain poisononing. It was clear even before the days of Snowden that the USA is the most advanced practising country in this field. So much so that the only attested backdoors in Huawei network gear had been planted there by the NSA.</p>

<p>Maybe the ban was caused by ZTE and friends removing the US backdoors?</p>

<p>Behind the security arguments there is also a lot of trade policy to protect US companies against foreign competitors. Free trade for US, no trade for THEM.<br />

<p>@ Bruce,</p>

<blockquote>But it's just one instance of the much larger issue of securing our supply chains.</blockquote>

<p>You have missed a point that any military historian would tell you leads to almost certain defeat,</p>

<blockquote>Why are our supply lines so long?</blockquote>

<p>In answering that you will realise where the problem exists. But if you then look at the secondary effect you will also realise the US has "lost this battle" and in all probability has "lost the war" as well.</p>

<p>I've explained this before and it has to do with "outsourcing" and US politicians --Republicans mainly from voting records-- forced it onto the US Gov entities including not just the military but intelligence community as well. They insisted on going down the COTS route and that placed the power increasingly in foreign hands.</p>

<p>But "outsourcing" is stupidity writ large at the best of times. Not only do you take money from your home economy and put it in a foreign economy which due to "economic churn" has about a hundred fold effect over a relatively short time period[1]. It also means you in effect kill off your home customer base as well[2]. Oh and then there is the Intellectual Property loss[3] which in turn kills off the home skills base[4].</p>

<p>The loss of the home skills base makes you even more vulnerable to supply chain poisoning as the skill gap increases in the foreign nations favour...</p>

<p>People have warned about these issues since the 1980's to my certain knowledge and the loss of the home TV and radio production market and in the 1960's through 70's with the loss of other FMCE markets as regular as clockwork since has been there for every one to see, if they could be bothered to look.</p>

<p>However "short termisum" in both corporations and politics has resulted in a steady decline. But worse the decline time is reducing. That is it's gone from years to months and is declining at ever decreasing time periods. That is if a home start-up puts out a new product they have as little as three months before foreign competition hits the market...</p>

<p>In fact there is evidence that "crowd funding" is the equivalent in some cases of giving the idea away for free to foreign companies. Who hit the market with product before the crowd funded start up has had time to finish development and get into manufacturing. We will see this more and more in the inevitable IoT market place.</p>

<p>Various western economies have done this to themselves via political idiology and moronic short sightedness. In effect they are lossing battle after battle and certainly in FMCE the war is lost and there is little or nothing left to fight back with as the manufacture of components is in effect entirely in foreign hands one way or another (look at China and it's policy on "rare earth metals" and similar).</p>

<p>Thus the question arises can we build secure systems with items that we believe are compromised?</p>

<p>The answer is yes there are techniques by which we can do this and I've been talking about them for quite some time on this blog (search for Castles-v-Prisons, C-v-P / CvP).</p>

<p>The simple fact is the outcome of this outsourcing idiocy has been visable for those that care to open their eyes for over a quater of a century. I've been thinking on and investigating methods of mitigation of what was obviously going to happen for as long if not longer.</p>

<p>The real question though is not can we mitigate the supply chain issues, but "Can we reduce the supply line length such that we can fight back?"</p>

<p>Or in a other words, are we beyond the tipping point of getting our industrial production on which everything else rests back into our home economy?</p>

<p>It realy is a "National Security" issue of the highest order, but will the idiots we vote for still be feathering their nests from the other short term thinking idiots who fund them, thus will not do anything about it because it's not in their personal financial interest to do so...</p>

<p>[1] Economic churn is generaly considdered to have a ten to one effect. That is if I pay you one USD you spending it in the home economy will overall cause ten USD economic activity. Thus if you instead pay the one USD into a foreign economy your home economy loses ten USD of economic activity and the foreign econommy gains ten USD of economic activity. However this also includes investment the home economy looses the economic investment thus stagnates or goes into long term recession. Whilst the foreign economy grows. When you look at this over a few years the effect on the home economy is horrendous.</p>

<p>[2] When you outsource abroad in the majority of cases you make people in the home economy redundant. They then do not buy the same level of goods and services as they did. Whilst they may not be your dirrect customers, they and others who get made redundant are customers of your customers. Thus you lose home custom. In many cases those jobs you pay for in foreign countries will not buy your products, nor will anybody else in that country who they do spend your money with. Thus you have lost cistomers by outsourcing abroad.</p>

<p>[3] Whenever you outsource, your organisations Intellectual Property gets transfered to the foreign country and those who work there. They will then take what they have learned and apply it to their own organisation and as their employees move organisations your IP gets spread to other foreign competitors...</p>

<p>[4] Most jobs have an inherant "up skilling" component, if the job is in another country it is the foreign countries work force that gets up skilled on your money. However the home economy having lost the outsourced job does not up skill. Even your companies still home economy workers don't get up skilled as it's "not cost effective". Therefore the home workforce gets down skilled in comparison.</p>

<p>@Peter</p>

<p>ZoneAlarm was a really nice simple and light product in its very early versions. Later ZoneAlarms main claim to fame was blocking two way traffic which was useful against phone home game copy protection. At the time Microsoft refused to have much to do with two way protection claiming that their OS built in firewall was a secure perimeter for business. The thing is Windows XP firewall was capable of this if you delved behind the schemes and set things manually. None of this helped much when security threats popped up within the perimeter as Valve et al and many other mainstream businesses discovered including one just this past week in spite of so-called smart network monitoring software. And so we go in great big circles.</p>

<p>My new to me laptops are incapable of running contemporary games even if I wanted to so this removes one temptation.</p>

<p>This is orthogonal to the topic but I read an interesting essay on photography editors some time ago. While Europe to some degree developed standards the US took this very seriously during the glory days of the media including commissioning new photo journalism. Other countries were much more slack and as the economics have deteriorated some foreign media have blatantly ripped off photographs without attribution. Israel is or was one of the worst offenders to the point here if I recall one of the editors picked up the phone to chase up one case with the guility newspaper. What they discovered wasn't that people were thieves by nature. They simply hadn't grown the culture of respect of the craft of commissioning and curating and their economics didn't support a standard the US and big newspapers in Europe could afford.</p>

<p>@ Lurker,</p>

<p>Firstly my appologies forva late reply, I've been under the weather and very physically tired.</p>

<p>With regards,</p>

<blockquote>Hence choosing Chinese opponents might not have been a good idea. They've been working on this for 3 thousand years, they can afford to wait a little longer.</blockquote>

<p>Those who think long term tend to profit the most in most things in life. Those who think short term tend to bring a "Drunkards walk" type of chaos to not just theor life but the lives of those around them. Worse those who think short term tend not to see anything but very short term trends thus not only making the chaos worse but in effect become blind to the real long term trends.</p>

<p>For instance, ask the question about just how much of the US has China invested in and you might be surprised by the result...</p>

<p>Thus in part some people in the US political sphear might just have been "woken up to" what that means[1].</p>

<p>However it might be way to little way to late, as I've noted before technology is "agnostic to use" it sees no "good guys" and no "bad guys". It does what it is instructed to do either by direct command or pre-programed response to certain events such as "loss of communications"[2]. Those who plan sufficiently ahead will be able to mitigate the issues, but they are a tiny fraction of the Western populous these days.</p>

<p>I also keep warning that the "attack only" Cyber-Initiatives thought up by the MIC is rather stupid as a policy, you need strong defense to fight a cyber-war as a Soverign nation. Trying to leverage the ideas of "asymetric warfare" does not work in your favour when you are by far the most dependent on Information System Interconect, thus have a hundreds or thousands more vulnerabilities and dependencies... The one lesson that should have been learned from 9/11 was how easily technology can be turned against those who are dependent on it. The fact that most if not all Western nations appear to have not learned that lesson is rather worrying...</p>

<p>[1] For those that are a little uncertain, there is a plot line in Issac Asimov's early "Foundation" series books, that pointed out that conventional war is difficult to prosecute if not only does your potential enemy control your supply lines but also controls the basic hardware that society has come to deppend on. Imagine if you will what would happen if all fridge / freezers and microwave ovens stopped functioning in the US. Or for that matter washing machines, or car ignition systems all of which are "becoming on line" as a necessity[2].</p>

<p>[2] It's debatable who is responsible for the "online idiocy" that is now also "Total Surveillance and Control". Or who let it get a major foothold as "connected systems" such as IoT, Cloud and Smart Phones. But the one thing that is certain, the more "online dependent" everything becomes, the more fragile it becomes and thus in turn society as it's dependence on such "online idiocy" becomes closer to total. Former President Obama talked of a "big red off switch" for the Internet to prevent hostile attack from one of the "Four Internet Threat Nations". But what if one of them has already built in it's own "Big Red Switch Countermeasure" to turn everything off based on some timeout counter? After all just how much use will your IoT based CCTV, TV's and all those other FMCE and White/Brown goods and vehicles etc be if they stop working when "they can not phone home" to say China? How about those "Smart Meters" deciding they have in effect been tampered with by losing comms and cutting of most peoples gas and electricity in the middle of winter... If your society is dependent on various technologies then making sure they are robust in the longterm is perhaps quite important if you don't wish to be a "vassal nation".  </p>

	<h2 class="entry" id="a011981">Friday Squid Blogging: New Research on Squid Camouflage</h2>
	
	
		
	
    
	    <p>From the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/science/squid-camouflage-colors.html">New York Times</a></i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08891-x">a paper published last week in Nature Communications</a> suggests that their chromatophores, previously thought to be mainly pockets of pigment embedded in their skin, are also equipped with tiny reflectors made of proteins. These reflectors aid the squid to produce such a wide array of colors, including iridescent greens and blues, within a second of passing in front of a new background. The research reveals that by using tricks found in other parts of the animal kingdom -- like shimmering butterflies and peacocks -- squid are able to combine multiple approaches to produce their vivid camouflage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Researchers studied Doryteuthis pealeii, or the longfin squid.</p>

<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven't covered.</p>

<p>Has anyone demonstrated a display that uses a mechanism like butterfly âstructuralâ color, i.e.  interference effects of light passing through and reflecting in the (controllable) gap between multiple surfaces ? Might offer low power and strong color obtained from ambient light, without the âstaring into a lightbulbâ effect of screen illumination by backing light.</p>

<p>For some months I have been mystified by the recent spate of newsworthy discoveries that some important corporation has made the mistake of keeping unencrypted files of user passwords. The mystery, of course, is not the complete obviousness of how bad that is, nor how easy it is to do better; rather, it is the complete idiocy of making such a mistake, and its prevalance among corporations that do not seem in all cases to be staffed entirely by idiots.</p>

<p>(I am ready to see corrections on the question of just how bad this is, and would be interested in the opinions of actual experts. I here omit my anecdotal evidence of its obviousness.)</p>

<p>The NYT piece by Brian X Chen on the Facebook security scandal of the day seems to imply an answer, deliberately or not, but does not carry it to its logical conclusion. The key passage: "Citing a Facebook insider, Mr. Krebs said access records revealed that 2,000 engineers or developers had made nine million queries for data that included plain-text user passwords." Please note the "or developers", and wonder whether they are all internal to Facebook.<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/technology/personaltech/facebook-passwords.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/technology/personaltech/facebook-passwords.html</a></p>

<p>A possible conclusion: the information was not kept securely because it was never intended to be secure. Much more convenient and profitable to let all the users' data leak to any of the 2,000 people who had access and the skills to make applications for selling everyone's private data. </p>

<p>I am curious whether this answer has been so obvious all along that no one has bothered to mention it, or it has been overlooked everywhere. The former seems unwise, since somewhere there is a congressperson with a at least an average IQ and the ability to follow the argument if it were presented - and the temperament to make a noise about it. The latter seems unlikely on the grounds of "If I can figure this out..."</p>

<p>Then again, there is the third possiblity, that I've got it all wrong. Ridiculous, of course?<br />

<p>I agree entirely. While I consider the idiom "do not ascribe to malice that which can be explained by incompetence", you do not get to be the world's largest social media company by accident.</p>

<p>9 million queries? Why? Did they doubt their implementation of a hash function that much that they needed to test "edge-cases" using live data? I doubt it.</p>

<p>That surely leaves only one inescapable conclusion?</p>

<p>From the Krebs' article:</p>

<blockquote>The Facebook source said the investigation so far indicates between 200 million and 600 million Facebook users may have had their account passwords stored in plain text and searchable by more than 20,000 Facebook employees. The source said Facebook is still trying to determine how many passwords were exposed and for how long, but so far the inquiry has uncovered archives with plain text user passwords dating back to 2012.</blockquote>

<p>This may be a coincidence, but Facebook's pivot to mobile began in 2012.</p>

<p><b>Thoughts on the B737 Airliner Scandal</b></p>

<p>Though this blog and its comments usually focus on malicious intervention, I suggest that "automation gone wrong" is another important aspect of security, the hazards of which grow steadily.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>Without delving into aerodynamics, it's important to understand that airliners have two systems to control pitch (the angle of the nose relative to the horizon).  Elevator control is:<br />
â¢ rapid<br />
â¢ controlled by hand motions on a lever ("analog" input)<br />
â¢ limited in pitch effect</p>

<p>whereas stabilizer control is:<br />
â¢ slow<br />
â¢ controlled by switches ("binary" input)<br />
â¢ several times more effective than elevators</p>

<p>The difference in effect is crucial: the elevators used for maneuvering have the capacity to keep the plane in controlled flight if, and only if, the stabilizer position is in the right general neighborhood.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>What is believed to have happened in the Lion Air crash, and likely to have been repeated in the recent Ethiopian crash, is that an automatic function called MCAS (intended, ironically, for safety) made a series of stabilizer adjustments which eventually drove the planes downward even with full nose-up elevator position.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>There are several aspects to the safety breakdown which apparently occurred on these planes, including:<br />
â¢ design of the MCAS system<br />
â¢ coverage (or omission) in flight manuals<br />
â¢ flight crew training<br />
â¢ flight crew proficiency<br />
â¢ deficient certification (regulatory) process</p>

<p>Although there were almost surely opportunities for flight crews to save these situations, the seeming failures to respond effectively were themselves (in my opinion) aggravated by the automation design.</p>

<p>Note: It seems that on at least a few occasions, the same type of MCAS malfunction occurred without accident because flight crews responded timely.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>To give one example of how MCAS design was dangerous: a much older safety system affecting pitch control (often called a "stick pusher") literally exerts a quite strong force on the yoke in the pilot's hands (at least, when not in autopilot).</p>

<p>This design (more than half a century old) had two great safety advantages:  first, the pilot would immediately feel the effect of the system intervention; and second, the pilot could immediately override the intervention (if s/he judged it inappropriate) by physically pulling on the yoke and overpowering the "pusher."  It's a sort of "right-brain" remedy.</p>

<p>By contrast, MCAS adjusts the stabilizer without making any noise other tactile/auditory signal (at least, as far as I have been able to learn).  When MCAS engages inappropriately, pilots must puzzle out why the plane is responding abnormally, process visual inputs in the cockpit, and reason through a "left-brain" process in order to diagnose the problem and respond effectively.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>The existing MCAS design bases its actions on values measured from one type of "air data" sensor on the aircraft.  The present hypothesis is that the observed MCAS anomalies occur when this angle-of-attack sensor malfunctions.</p>

<p>In essence, the MCAS makes correct responses to a false assessment of the aircraft state.  Obviously, the system design has (in effect) a single-point-of-failure vulnerability.<br />
__________________________________</p>

<p>Reports of a Boeing internal assessment of MCAS problems disclose several significant findings:</p>

<p>1. The actual MCAS range of pitch adjustment is about 4 times as great as the range on which the Boeing safety analysis was based.</p>

<p>2. The analysis was based on a single incorrect pitch adjustment by MCAS, and failed to account for a scenario in which after a while MCAS would effectively reset, and iteratively repeat the incorrect adjustment, leading to cumulatively large stabilizer mispositioning.</p>

<p>3. At the assessed level of criticality for MCAS, its design should not have relied on a single type of sensor as input.</p>

<p class="commentcredit"><span class="commenter">Ergo Sum</span> &bull; <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/friday_squid_bl_669.html#c6790469">March 23, 2019  5:59 AM</a>

<p>@MarkH...</p>

<p>Nice summary, thanks...</p>

<p>The 737 MAX has a design flaw, wherein the airplaneâs center of gravity is permanently unstable. The larger, more fuel efficient engines are moved closer to fuselage. In addition, to meet ground clearance requirements, the engines are moved forward and higher on the wings. The article below explains this pretty well:</p>

<p>h**ps://graphics.reuters.com/ETHIOPIA-AIRLINE-CONTROLS/0100916V1NZ/index.html</p>

<p>The end result is a plane, that can stall, in another word lose lift. The MCAS is intended to keep the plane in balance to prevent stalling.</p>

<p>The end result, with all of its faults, is clearly on BOEING and to a certain extent on the FAA. In 2005, FAA changed how the airplanes are certified by allowing BOEING and others to certify their own planes. The FAA had been relegated to review and approve the manufacturer's documentation. The 737 MAX had been the first airplane that had been approved by FAA based on the new certification process, in 2012 or 2013.</p>

<p>The optional "security add on" included warning light for malfunctioning sensor and MCAS. Like most "add-on", it's an additional cost for airlines that some of them did not opt for. The main reason being, that they did not know much about the impact of the MCAS and unfortunately, neither did some of the pilots.</p>

<p>While BOEING and FAA are responsible for the end results, the pilots are not entirely innocent either. It's hard to understand how pilots would not learn the in and out of the new airplane and it's controls. The lack of appropiate training is part of it, but if you are a pilot, it isn't just the passengers on the plane whose life is at risk. The life of the pilot is at risk too.</p>

<p>Automation going haywire is a fact of life everywhere, it isn't necessarily the fault of automation. Humans are just as much at fault for not knowing how to correct the faulty automation at hand.   </p>

</p>
<p>@MarkH, Ergo Sum:<br />
Boeing was clearly aware of those problems, but they heavily underestimated them. They even had the "AOA disagree" system, but it was optional as it was the pilot training. <br />
I am sure that if the pilots did have the proper training they would have handled the situation. It's not the first time that faulty (or even working as intended for that matter) automation combined with lack of pilot training led to accidents, and unfortunately it won't be the last ... Not to mention most flights are fully automated and most pilots don't really know how to fly "manually" or how to react if the automation fails. <br />
Now the "AOA disagree" warning system will be default instead of optional, and pilot training will be mandatory. Too late for the 300+ souls though ... </p>

<p>The design flaw in the MAX is that it requires any flesh and blood pilot at all. Stop trying to train around human limitations and let the software do all the work--safer, faster, cheaper. </p>

<p>Boeings mistake was that it wanted to offload some flight deck responsibility to the children of the magenta line. Unsurprsingly, some of them biffed their task. Plane crashes. </p>

<p>@Humdee<br />
Pilots can't learn something if they don't know they are supposed to learn it. As i said, it was an overlooked piece of hardware/software. They heavily underestimated the MACS importance, after all it wasn't a system that controls the toilet lights, but a critical system in aircraft maneuvering. To fly a commercial airliner you need a type rating that's not easy to get nor cheap. It's not like you can buy or rent a 737 MAX and play with it. If more importance would have been given to the MACS system it would have made a huge difference.</p>

<p>Facebook knows very well that people reuse passwords.  It seems likely to me that facebook used these passwords for further data harvesting.  And some percentage of their "developers" must be hackers.  What a bonanza for them.  </p>

<p>Facebook's concern for users is closest to their concern for a lobster they are about to throw alive into boiling water and eat, all the while commenting: "Dumb lobster!"</p>

<p>"But all my lobster friends are on facebook!  Where will I find another company to treat me like an insensate piece of meat if I am not an facebook?"  Baah!!  Baah!!  Which are you?

<p>@Faustus: Facebook is exploiting an infinite resource: human stupidity, and they do it very well. I don't know which is more stupid: sharing your most intimate stuff with an entity that you know will share it with others or just mishandle it, or complaining when this eventually happens ? But hey, people have nothing to hide ... I am certain that if Facebook would somehow disappear,  a lot would become suicidal. I still don't get it, if you willingly share stuff and have nothing to hide, why bother when Fabebook f..s up ? </p>

<p>@Bob Paddock:</p>

<p>"doesn't that mean that any moving mass, even if optically cloaked or undersea like a Sub, would be detectable?"</p>

<p>Yes and no, you have the single-v-multi sensor issue.</p>

<p>Put simply untill recently you detect mass by it's effect on other mass, part of that is the distance between the two masses. If you have your sensor mass indicating a 'mass at a distance' then the distant object can trade mass with distance from the sensor mass and it would not detect any change.</p>

<p>Thus with rockets for instance with most of their mass being fuel it might be possible to design it so that a war head could get in effective range before there is any significant mass movement directly to wards the sensor mass detected.</p>

<p>You have similar issues with passive range detectors that use just signal strength. If the transmitter knows where the range detector is it can change it's signal output level accordingly. It can also easily fake the Doppler shift for a single sensor as well.</p>

<p>It's why you should always have a long base line approximately orthagonal to the target with multiple sensors and move atleast one of them in an apparently random manner known only to the sensor operator.</p>

<p>Whilst it might appear academic you can turn things on their head. If your drone only has one GPS antenna then it's vulnerable to a form of fairly simple spoofing attack. Where you pick up the signals at a remote antenna and rebroadcast them at the drone, if your signal is stronger at the drone then you win. It's a little bit more complicated but in essence thats what you do.</p>

<p>@Sherman Jerrold re: FEMA breach - Just want to point out that most decisions in Federal bureaucracies are made by career bureaucrats whose tenure span multiple political administrations. With some exceptions, policies with respect to such criteria as security of data are also evolved and administered over the long term. As much as I despise Trump & co, I think it would be a mistake to attribute the dysfunction of FEMA in general, and the lack of planning and diligence leading to this breach specifically, too predominately to the current administration. That might be emotionally satisfying, to an extent, but inaccurate attribution will tend to hinder solutions more than to promote them.</p>

<p>@James re: 737 MAX "Not to mention most flights are fully automated and most pilots don't really know how to fly "manually" or how to react if the automation fails."<br />
This to me is a huge problem in and of itself. The first question that occurred to me as I read of these crashes was of how bad an aircraft design could be for its designers to believe that pilots were incompetent to correct likely flight anomalies, and that the corrections should be taken entirely out of their hands. I'm sorry to say that your statement rings true in that regard. Automated systems will sometimes fail; critical automated systems will sometimes fail catastrophically. Automated systems require human monitoring at some remove (the degree is certainly subject to debate.) To just flat out ignore that need in the interest of development resource economies is, and will continue to be, a recipe for disaster(s) I expect similar outcomes if (when?) US DOT begins allowing autonomous vehicles to share highways with human driven conveyances without sufficient testing with a human present and capable of overriding mistakes. At least the per incident carnage in those cases should be smaller in magnitude.</p>

<p>@VinnyG:<br />
I don't think the 737 MAX is actually flawed by design (just an opinion, i only have a PPL-A SEP, hobby license, what we're talking about here is on a whole different level). The fact they did not change the training to include this particular system is outright stupid, especially since (from what i have been reading) some pilots did complain. Allowing a single point of failure (one AOA sensor) for a critical system is also stupid.<br />
Take the B2 Spirit for example, the available public info, it's impossible to fly that plane by hand. Most critical systems are handeled by computers. But at a 2Bn price tag, i bet those pilots know every nut and bolt on that plane. <br />
It's not the first time a piece of automation designed to save your live ends up killing you, unfortunately it won't be the last ... </p>

<p>@Humdee: Let's agree to disagree. Remember that all our tech is made by humans. Indeed human error accounts for the better part of accidents. However, if you break that down, human error not always equals pilot error. Remember, automation is also made by humans. If a pilot fails, he crashes his flight. If an engineer fails, he crashes several flights, until the investigators catch up on the flaw. Most of the times an air crash is not caused by one single failure, but by a cascade of failures, human, mechanical, logistical or otherwise. It's a system strong as it's weakest link. You could conclude that the 737 MAX fiasco is technically human error, but not really pilot error. Human pilots saved the day on several occasions, they complained to the airlines "hey, this bird is doing something it wasn't supposed to do, and that isn't in the SOP" and they were ignored. Human error indeed, but not pilot error, until proven otherwise. I agree in our day is illogical to hold the yoke in your hand for a transatlantic flight when an automated system can hold your track / FL / etc, however i want a trained pilot in that cockpit not a computer. </p>

<p>Scarily you are actually more likely to die of a disease you picked up from one of the other people in the line... TB and similar are on the rise in part because of changes to the security arrangements and health care standards are dropping (hence the US now has a falling average age of death).</p>

<p>So next time you are standing their watching the dust in the air, remember that somebody probably coughed it their along with another half million or so other aerial contaminates you can not see but are breathing in, and one just might have your name on it...</p>

<p>@Humdee:</p>

<p>"Pilot error is the #1 cause of airline incidents reported to the FAA."</p>

<p>I'm aleays cautious of 'pilot error' when the person is not there to defend themselves, especially when auto pilots are involved.</p>

<p>Often it is easier to blaim the pilot than say we have to little evidence of what actually went wrong.</p>

<p>In the UK some years ago a Chinook helicopter flew into the ground in scotland when carrying quite a few anti-terrorism experts. The military enquirey was decidely deficient and the pilots who were dead were blaimed. A group of people carried out their own investigation and showed the enquiry to be the travisty it was. Eventually the military had to climb down and admit that actually the most likely cause was not pilot error but as the result of a software upgrade.</p>

<p>This prompted others to make their own investigations and an inyetesting statistic came to light. The likely hood of a pilot being blaimed was quite a bit different if the pilot was a survivour.</p>

<p>So I'd treat the pilot error findings when the pilots are dead as being a 'lift the corner of the carpet' excercise on behalf of those investigating.</p>

<p>That said I've long believed that automated systems are both more consistant and more reliable than humans.</p>

<p>The problem is that automated systems lack much of the awarness an alert and experienced pilot has when it comes to any one of a million or so errors. The engineers who design those systems work with 'what is known' not what is unknown. Thus any new type of failure is going to be unknown to the system and stay that way untill the software goes through an update, extensive testing and an eventually slow roll out around the world. This leaves a large window in which things can further go wrong.</p>

<p>But yes like you I want to get the pilot out of the airplane, but only when the system is sufficient, which currently they are for uneventful flights but the eventful flights no not yet not by quite some way.<br />

<p>@1&1~=Umm best comment yet. I could not have said it better myself. Sometimes (unfortunately too many times) it's easier to blame the dead. They can't defend themselves, they don't care ... Occam's razor sometimes works, but most of the times it doesn't especially not in our day ... </p>

<p>@Ergo Sum:</p>

<p>Thanks for the link to the explainer, which is done quite well (as usual for Reuters).  I see that these planes still have trim wheels, so I stand corrected that stabilizer controls are only binary -- the switches on the control yokes are simply up/down, but the trim wheels are "analog style."</p>

<p>I would not say that the engine configuration change on the MAX introduced instability ... "unstable" has a quite specific meaning in aviation.  Rather, I would call it an unusual handling characteristic.</p>

<p>Aviation has a long history of automatic systems to counteract both tricky handling characteristics (which I believe exist in one form or another on all airliners), and actual instability.  Until now, these were designed in thoughtful ways that minimize any trouble to the flight crew.<br />
_______________________________</p>

<p>The beginning of the Reuters article explains how "yoke jerk" shut off the automatic trim system in older 737s.  This is a great example of the old Boeing design philosophy: the pilot's natural and intuitive response to aircraft misbehavior disables the automatic system.<br />
_______________________________</p>

<p>My interest in this type of aviation accident dates back to the early days of Airbus super-tech airliner design, when I read an account of a fatal crash which occurred (as I recall) in Asia.</p>

<p>In that case, the flight crew had accidentally set the "mode" of their highly automated plane for takeoff, when in fact they were in the landing phase.</p>

<p>The Airbus automatic control system kept winding in nose-up stabilizer, in response its observation of descent when it expected to ascend.  The pilots reacted by pushing their joysticks forward, in an effort to keep the nose down.  This continued until the stabilizer angle was so great that even with full down elevator, the jet stalled and crashed.</p>

<p>In Boeing designs of that era, the pilots' assertive control inputs would have switched off automatic trim ... but in the Airbus, the pilots needed to understand that automatic trim was the cause of their troubles, and then push a button to disable automatic trim.</p>

<p>I was horrified by this vision of the doomed aircrew in a losing battle with an automated system <i>which was fighting against them.</i></p>

<p>My takeaway, was to <i><b>NEVER</b></i> allow automation to wage an extended tug-of-war against the human pilots.  [Another example of getting this wrong was Toyota effectively preventing drivers from shutting off the engine in response to stuck throttle.]</p>

<p>A reasoned case can be made for removing people from vehicle control loops.  But as long as they are there, allowing the computers to override the pilots is a lousy policy.<br />
______________________________</p>

<p>A family member who long worked as an aerodynamicist at Boeing explained to me (many years ago now) that as long as Boeing retains its ideas about flight controls, they would never replace the cockpit yokes with Airbus-style "sidesticks" (similar to gaming joysticks).</p>

<p>It's really a shock to me, and very sad, to learn that Boeing forgot how to incorporate the pilots' natural, tactile responses as a cornerstone of flight control safety.</p>

<p>@MarkH</p>

<p>Yeah, automation is supposed to warn you if you do something stupid, and to help you. The point is that the plane maker and airline teaches you about all those details. Not knowing those it's like having an evil twin in the cockpit that pushes the yoke down "just because". As an analogy, is like driving a car on the freeway and someone just turns your steering wheel right or left. </p>

<p>The 737 MAX problem is not easily attributable, is a systemic fault. You can't blame it on a specific person/company/issue. Can't blame it on Boeing, can't blame it on the FAA, can't blame it on the airlines, can't blame it on the pilots. We made a very good and efficient plane, but it's a bit harder to fly. Oh well, forget about it, it makes us money, why not ? How hard can it be to fly it ? and so on. Everybody has cut corners here, not just Boeing, not just the FAA , but everybody. Systemic fault. Too bad 300+ people had to die. </p>

Eucalyptus essential oil.  quality kind that comes in a 10ml vial,  not the supermarket variety. Or oregano oil essential oil. Even better is the medicinal oregano oil designed for internal use (which essential oils are not)as its doubly effective taken internally. <br />
a tiny amount on a tissue inhaled occasionally is a life saver on aeroplanes, and queues such as those described. Of course the Met and the Tube. <br />

<p>Just wanted to share , what I thought was a very well thought out email from one of the service provides I have an online account with, regarding a recent data breach they encountered on their system.</p>

<p>"Hello Kanopy Community:</p>

<p>I wanted to send you one final note with an update from my email yesterday, regarding the recent security incident we experienced at Kanopy. </p>

<p>We have hired a leading forensics firm to assist with our ongoing investigation and continue to gather more specific information. During the incident, some of our web logs were made available, showing usersâ IP addresses and associated activity. While this is unfortunate, we have no evidence to date that this information has been used maliciously and, upon learning of the incident, we immediately secured all of the data on our system. At this time, there is no required action for you to take.</p>

<p>For a five-hour window during the incident, it may have also exposed data from 162 accounts â a very small subset of our total user base â containing usersâ registered email address, Kanopy password, and in 82 cases, the public library account number. We have terminated the passwords for the known impacted accounts and have contacted those individuals via email so that they can take steps to reset their passwords. If you did not receive an email from us asking you to reset your Kanopy password, then we do not believe that your account was impacted.</p>

<p>Our investigation into the full scope of the incident remains ongoing, and, when more information is available, we will advise the impacted individuals as appropriate. <br />
We take the privacy and security of your personal information seriously and we apologize for any inconvenience or concern this may cause. "</p>

<p>@Rach El @James:</p>

<p>"Eucalyptus essential oil. quality kind that comes in a 10ml vial, not the supermarket variety. Or oregano oil essential oil."</p>

<p>Yes some essential oils do have antibiotic properties whilst others astringent properties, by which they protect themselves from microbes of various kinds (even real maple syrup has some if you don't cook them out). But... some also have protections against larger organics that munch thus they have poisons for us 'meat sacks'</p>

<p>Eucalyptus smells nice and can even make bad tempered Koalas appear more cute. However the reason for both their cuteness and bad temper is what they eat and the high levels of cyanide it contains. Whilst nearly ever tree that produces 'pitted fruit' generates some level of cyanide, they tend to localise it in the pits (stone kernels/seeds) the Eucaluptus puts it in the leves and other places as well along with it's high calorific oils. If you ever have the misfortune to be near a Eucalyptus when it burns you will find it burns hot and vigorously.</p>

<p>But it's not just trees many carbohydrate rich plant tubers also contain cyanide or other poisons some like cassava can have low quantities in some varieties and can have the cyanide simply processed out to a safe level, whilst other almost the same looking varieties can not... Look up 'Death by cassava' to see why you realy should listen to old grannie tales. The same is true for potatoes, tomatoes and rhubarb all of which you would have found in British gardens.</p>

<p>Contrary to what some says about security attacks not getting worse with time, food security is in part bassed on knowledge, and the knowledge is not getting handed down from generation to generation any longer. What I learnt about 'green potato' and various beans like 'kiddney beans' is not getting taught to most children.</p>

<p>But it's not just food security, ICT Security appears to suffer with mistakes endlessly repeated, a sure sign people are not learning from yesterdays mistakes.</p>

<p>And now the lack of 'past knowledge' mistakes have 'Physical Agency' and are killing people. The software industry in particular needs to get a grip on it's self before the politicians are forced to act, because in this century they tend to over react and 'kill the golden goose'.  </p>

<p><strong>Comments on the 'quality' of my country's BSc Infosec courses</strong></p>

<p>For the last couple of months, I've had the company at work of someone who did my country's officially sanctioned "Whitehat hacker" BSc programme. He can do penetration tests and the like, and has learned a lot about security (or so he thinks).</p>

<p>I've been less that impressed with his knowledge and especially his description of the courses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Almost exclusive focus on modern Windows and (Ubuntu) Linux. Macs are completely glossed over, security-oriented Linuxes are mentioned in passing (but no real experience) with the caveat that NONE of the Linuxes often mentioned on this blog are taught, other OSes are completely not mentioned, no knowledge of Unix history, no knowledge of differences between Ubuntu Linux and other *n*xes - and anything that isn't Windows or Ubuntu-derived apparently sucks.</li>
<li>Very strong focus on security through obscurity (that pretty much damns it all).</li>
<li>No clue where to find things on the internet that aren't part of the curriculum.</li>
<li>They teach about the Dark Web, as well as the more popular protocols (HTTP(S), FTP, Windows-exclusive shit...). Nothing about Usenet and other older protocols. Nothing about the less well-known seedier parts of the internet (e.g. Imageboards such as 4chan).</li>
<li>They are told about Hacker News...and that's pretty much it. Places such as security blogs and other things that might at occasion skirt my country's official position on what people may or may not do on the internet are unknown (and can't be found because they were told not to look for them).</li>
<li>Thinking out of the box is out of the question.</li>
<li>Lots of focus on all kind of gadgets and iot stuff, lots of focus on modern approaches, close to zero background knowledge.</li>
<li>Very limited methodological knowledge that would be very helpful on figuring out why things go wrong or don't work straight away. </li>
</ul>

<p>The result is a security researcher who doesn't seem to understand the essential parts of being a security researcher, simply because he was not taught how to be properly curious (or rather: it was partially extinguished during his education). Suggestions on where to find stuff are often ignored for the sole reason of "I've never heard of that, can't be good.", while anything he finds on his own must be good (without really looking into it). He makes a lot of avoidable errors as a result of this. Also, I didn't know that a good way of "hardening" a system was to install it with all possible optional software packages...</p>

<p>Much of this also generally applies to University level IT here...gods, it's bad. And the people that come out of it have no clue how bad they are.</p>

<p>@James,</p>

<p>"...The 737 MAX problem is not easily attributable, is a systemic fault. You can't blame it on a specific person/company/issue...."</p>

<p>The -accidents- were systemic faults, the -blame- rests -entirely- on Boeing.<br />
..</p>

<p>@Anyone,<br />
1. Some aircraft -cannot fly- without very sophisticated Flight Control Systems; the 737MAX is -not- one of them.</p>

<p>2. The human brain is quite capable of making split-second decisions in an emergency; pilots often have only seconds to do that.</p>

<p>3. We are quickly reaching the point where pilots are being overloaded with data regarding the behavior of the FCS, especially the human/machine interface.  If they encounter FCS anti-stall behavior during takeoff, they don't have time to review a checklist, folks are gonna die.</p>

<p>4. Extensive use of autopilot can result in complacency in the cockpit. Modern FCS can takeoff, fly and land by themselves.  This gives the technologists the idea that pilots can be eliminated.  It's already happening in the automotive sector.</p>

<p>I'm not usually a fan of retribution, but some cases call for it.  Class action lawsuits merely scratch the surface.  Jail time might be more appropriate.</p>

<p>Well they keep on flying for a while atleast, then some... There are still 737 MAX flying around the US, oh and Boeing have not stopped or slowed their manufacture of them according to Bloomberg,</p>

no, it does not. the blame rests on everybody in the chain, that is why it's not easily attributable. </p>

<p>Those two articles important to human factor in security, the second in particular related to necessity of privacy as well:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20190321-in-defense-of-corporate-buzzwords" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20190321-in-defense-of-corporate-buzzwords</a></p>

<p>"I donât really think I believe that âbusiness speakâ exists,â he says. âWeâre all the same species of bipedal mammal. <br />
[!!!!}Putting business suits on a bunch of hairless primates and putting them together in an office block doesnât really change them much. [The way] they will tussle, rival each other, look for leadership, listen to each other, pick up words and phrases will evolve from each other.</p>

<p>New York City-based executive coach Alisa Cohn agrees. âWe are tribal animals, and there is something about jargon that marks us as insiders Â­â one of the tribe Â­â [who] will be protected and not eaten in the event of an attack by tigers.â</p>

<p>Cohn hears a lot of jargon in her line of work, and even has her own favorite words: âecosystemâ, âswim laneâ (aka scope of someoneâs job) and âpeanut butter the raisesâ, which she says âmeans spreads evenly like a peanut butter sandwichâ.<br />
*****</p>

<p>Weâre told that lying is always the worst option, but that isnât always true.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190324-what-if-we-knew-when-people-were-lying" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190324-what-if-we-knew-when-people-were-lying</a></p>

<p>"For Chidi and some other philosophers, the obligation not to lie trumps all other moral imperatives, including not hurting someoneâs feelings. Few people actually adhere to such a strict prescription for honesty, however. Lying is an accepted part of daily life, from our automatic response of âgoodâ when asked how we are, to the praise we give when a friend asks if we like her awful new haircut (or pair of boots).</p>

<p><br />
Yet despite the ubiquity of lies in our lives, most of us are not very good at detecting deception. What would happen, though, if we could suddenly tell, without a doubt, when we were being lied to? The technological or psychological mechanism that would enable this impossible new skill is not worth dwelling on. Instead, what matters is what it reveals about the often-overlooked and underestimated role lying plays in our lives.  </p>

<p>Many researchers believe humans began lying to each other almost as soon as they invented language, primarily as a way to get ahead. âLying is so easy compared to other ways of gaining power,â Sissela Bok, an ethicist at Harvard University, told National Geographic. âItâs much easier to lie in order to get somebodyâs money or wealth than to hit them over the head or rob a bank.â </p>

<p>Throughout human history, lying has also served as âan evolutionary necessity to protect ourselves from harm,â says Michael Lewis, a distinguished professor of paediatrics and psychiatry at Rutgers University. This includes protection from persecution â a purpose that lying still serves today for many people around the world. If we could suddenly detect all lies, lives in countries where infidelity, homosexuality or certain religious beliefs are illegal could be put at risk.</p>

<p>Lying also benefits us when the stakes are less high, including at work. If we told our boss what we really thought of him, or why we actually didnât make our deadline, we might be fired or demoted. We also lie to make ourselves look better and maintain an air of professionalism. âRecently, I was late to a meeting, and I just said the subway was slow,â says Kang Lee, a professor of applied psychology and human development at the University of Toronto. âIn fact, the subway didnât delay me â I was just late because of my own fault â but I donât think it would be good for me professionally if my colleagues could detect this.â</p>

<p>Weâd also have more hurt feelings. For most of us, a world without lies would deliver an immediate blow to our self-image, says Dan Ariely, professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University. âLiving with the truth means you would get more honest, brutal feedback about your work, the way you dress, the way you kiss â all kinds of things like that,â he says. âYou would realize that people donât pay as much attention to you and youâre not as important and highly qualified as you think you are.â</p>

<p>Children themselves learn the social value of lying from a very young age. âMom might say to the child, âListen, grandma is going to give you a present for Hanukkah, and youâve got to tell grandma that you like it, otherwise itâll hurt her feelings,ââ Lewis says. By the age of three or four, studies show that many children have mastered the art of the polite lie.</p>

<p>Indeed, in terms of interpersonal relationships, âit would be an utter disaster if we could in fact detect lying and deception,â Lewis says. âLying is a total and complete necessity in a culture in which the moral understanding is you donât want to hurt the feelings of other people.â</p>

<p>most people said they engaged in dishonesty in order to avoid hurting their partner or damaging their relationship. If romances suddenly involved total truthfulness about everything from the way our partner looks in the morning to whether we ever engaged in infidelity, many relationships likely would not last.</p>

<p>âI like to joke that the reason my wife and I have been married 40 years is because we have separate bathrooms,â Ekman says. âThatâs only partially a joke, though, because thereâs things you donât want people, even your spouse, to know about â and it isnât just bathroom behavior.â</p>

<p>It's impossible to predict all the ways we would benefit and suffer if all lies were laid bare, but what is for certain is that the world would be a very different place to the one we live in today. Humans, however, are adaptable, and âover time, we would develop new norms and acceptable codes of social conduct,â Bakir says.</p>

<p>At the same time, she continues, we would likely do all we could to develop new ways of lying and deceiving each other, whether through technology, drugs, social behavior or mental training.</p>

<p>Kang agrees. âIâm 100% certain weâd continue to deceive each other somehow, weâd just find a different way to do it. Itâs a life necessity.â</p>

<p>My take: sometimes small lie is better than big scandal.</p>

<p>"Newly Disclosed NSA Documents Shed Further Light on Five Eyes Alliance"</p>

<p>If you look back far enough on this blog you will find posts on both the BURSA (original name) and UKUSA (later name) agrements as they became 'officialy' public knowledge.</p>

<p>It's clear from those that various people had made earlier posts outlining much of what was under the agrements.</p>

<p>What the author of the article apparently does not realise is that the British set up the agrement in exactly that way, very specifically to their advantage. Even now the UK is still in many respects the dominant partner on policy and many operational asspects.</p>

<p>The original British idea was that the US did the manufacturing of equipment for the British, as well as providing technical staff at the lower layers. The British however would bring to the table what the US lacked and still does which is 'access'to satellites and cables. Part of the reason the US is fighting hard to keep the US the 'hub of the internet' is to try and remove the strangle hold on access the UK has via Australia, Canada, and New Zeland.</p>

<p>What few realise and the NZ Premier found out the hardway is they do not run their SigInt agencies and the agencies have no allegiance except in 'lip service' to their elected Governments and the citizens. Put simply the UK and to a lesser extent the US that run the show as an unalined entity responsible only to it's self. The UK usually setting the stratigic direction and the US implementing it. Even though 9/11 caused a major shake up of the US IC it had very little effect on the UK-US SigInt relationship. In part it's because of this that the questions about secondments of UK personnel in various key areas are being asked, but mainly ignored. Because it's actually not in the interests of either the US or UK SigInt's to change a system that serves them very well as effectively a combined or symbiotic entity.</p>

<p>In part the NSA has suffered a loss of turf to other parts of the US Mil&IC to do with the Internet. Whilst this would worry the NSA as an independent entity, what it has appeared to loose at home, has been more than covered by the UK and their dependent Five Eyes partners who have the access covered.</p>

<p>Which begs the question of US 'home traffic going international' if people care to look it up there is one heck of a load of US2US traffic that gets routed across international boundries by the likes of BGP misconfiguration. It's been assumed by some that this is the likes of the Chinese etc 'stealing traffic', few ask the obvious question of who benifits from these oddities over all, to which the answer is the Five-Eye SigInt community via the fairly obvious --if people look-- choke points sitting in the teritorial waters and skys of the non US Five-Eye partners.</p>

<p>Much of what this symbiotic SigInt entity gets upto at the base level is 'hiding in plain sight'. From this and a little thought gives you the stratigic direction and appropriate technical knowledge 'fills in the middle'.</p>

<p>As has been observed on this blog fairly often, these SigInt entities are realy not that much in front of the open academic and tellecommunication communities. Where they do have leads is becoming less relevant, which is just as well as the 'talent pool' they used to draw on has in effect dried up for them as they can no longer offer either the 'ego food' or 'material rewards' for such people in the face of Silicon Valley etc. Thus all the SigInt agencies are starting to suffer from 'in house time servers' and 'out sourced contractors' who only nominaly work for the SigInt agencies.</p>

<p>It is in effect 'COTS' wave II, they have to get not just their tech from the open market but now their staff as well. Which is the heart felt wish of the MIC with the likes of Silicon Valley effectively becoming the US IC technical arm and increasingly compeating with the SigInt and CommsInt analysts via 'Big Data' and orher leading edge tech. Have a look at Peter Thiels Palantair service and one or two others. What they hold tends to make Facebook look a joke. </p>

<p>They would be wrong...</p>

<p>Anthropologists worked out years ago that 'secrecy' thus 'deception' which is 'lying by deed or action' was happening right from the begining with tribes.</p>

<p>That is it was in a faimily or larger tribes interest to conceal prime food sights from other families and tribes.</p>

<p>Thus lying in it's various forms is a prime survival skill not just for humans, not just primates but most other mamals and hot blooded creatures.</p>

<blockquote>What the author of the article apparently does not realise is that the British set up the agrement in exactly that way, very specifically to their advantage. Even now the UK is still in many respects the dominant partner on policy and many operational asspects.</blockquote>

<p>Writing on the âDescription of SIGINT Relations between NSA and GCHQâ (December 1985) document, the authors of the Lawfare piece seem to touch on that here, but your point is clear:</p>

<blockquote>The document hints at how the two agencies facilitate such sharing in practice, including by ensuring that the âGCHQ has direct access to NSA computer systems.â</blockquote>

<p>Though the times they are 'a changin', collection remains paramount. As so, it seems to me that traffic shaping, 5g network slicing and IoT are ready-made efficiencies built to serve  the likes of XKeyscore interception and analysis engines. Where the two, UKUSA, come out on 5g will be interesting, to say the least.</p>

</p>
<p>@gordo:</p>

<p>"Where the two, UKUSA, come out on 5g will be interesting, to say the least."</p>

<p>The owner of most of the relevant 5G patents is China. The company concerned is known to have had a good relationship with not just the UK Gov, but also the public face of GCHQ via their center in Aylesbury UK where the GCHQ bods work alongside the company employees verifying not just code but hardware as well.</p>

<p>There have been few if any problems untill the US started making lots of noise about the company who unlike the US Gov has not been caught red handed hiding security failings in various major US Company products (not just Juniper and Cisco). Then the UK Gov issued a report that to be honest could have been aimed as much against the US Gov as it was the Chinese Gov. In simple terms they kind of said the company supply chain was vulnerable... That said it's fairly obvious that most major US Companies and UK companies all have supply chain issues, there is basically nothing that can be done about it and remain economically viable.</p>

<p>Back some years ago the NSA for instance had doubts about the integrity of it's supply chain even though at the time it was still making equipment entirely within the US. However it realy went 'out the window' when US Politicos decided that the NSA had to buy standard parts etc etc on not just on the commercial market, but the 'Consumer Of The Shelf' market. Which they knew ment that they would suffer from 'grey market' and 'counterfit market' issues, along with various dial home implants. If you remember back there was a lot of noise about the consumer arm that had once been part of IBM. The company that took it over was Lenovo and they were caught out installing 'Advanced Peraistant Threat' (APT) malware in the BIOS that used an original IBM PC feature supported by DOS and later Windows to alow 'IO ROM Code' to install malware no mater how often you replaced the OS or hard drive.</p>

<p>So realistically the UK Gov report via GCHQ was more 'political posturing' than anything else. As they have not as far as I know asked any other 5G tenderers to meet anything remotely like they do of the Chinese Company.</p>

<p>The joke is that EU legislation requires a level playing field for large tenders with Government involvement. The fact the UK Gov is not abiding by these rules kind of tells you fairly well nearly everthing you need to know about the UK-US 'Special Relationship' at the inter-government level.</p>

<p>But to be honest I rather hope 5G fails misserably, it actually has little to offer over 4GLTE in terms of performance and has the specific issue that 5G handsets are not transferable from one operator to another. So are the old equivalent of 'Service Provider Locked Phones' which in the EU is a bit of a 'no no'. Thus network interoperabilty with 5G can not realistically happen, thus it will fall back to 4GLTE anyway... So from the consumer perspective you have to ask what the 'value added' is for them and the answer is little or nothing.</p>

<p>Thoughts on the B737 Airliner Scandal<br />
...</p>

<p>well worded/well summarized but some errors in my opinion - When the MCAS system activates, a large wheel next to the pilots knee spins offering an immediate indication that the horizontal stabilizer is changing position<br />
based on time activated and rotation rate.  The wheel has a knob on it that can be pulled out if manual control is required/desired (suicide knob like).  If you pull out that knob and forget, automatic activation may bruise your leg/break your kneecap.  Likewise if you pull that out you can slow or jam the system so the drive motor can't move the stabilizer.  This design is common since 707/KC-135 aircraft in Boeing airplanes.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jetphotos/status/911612875923320832" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/jetphotos/status/911612875923320832</a><br />
see the big black wheels (edge view) on either side of the throttle quadrant.</p>

<p>The problem was the crew was task saturated and did not understand they needed to over ride an automatic system deliberately and with force because there was no guidance in the manual and no training to do so. They were using the yoke mounted manual drive to slew the stabilizer back into position, and then the faulty automatic system was driving if ever further out of trim - hence the aircraft was repeatedly pitching up and down.  While this was occuring they likely became fixated/task saturated and did not realize their airspeed was getting dangerously high on the descents.  It is entirely probable they damaged/tore off a flight control surface from excess airspeed/dynamic pressure on the last dive which precluded the ability to recover.</p>

<p>The automatic system was installed because the center of thrust with the new engines was forward of the old engines and Boeing wanted the plane to manually handle similar to the old 737 so no retraining was required.</p>

<p>Increasing the thrust on the new aircraft as you would in a go around or other emergency scenario, causes a greater pitch up moment due to the new forward center of thrust.  Changing the horizontal stabilizer position automatically (without pilot action) counters this moment (in theory) so the aircraft continues to handle normally (as expected like an old 737) in manual flight control.  Tragic that nobody throught this through.  But also explains why a culture with a suspicion of automatic systems and a mental mind set/willingness to override automatic systems could deal with this emergency and save the aircraft while a culture of compliant/passive people might not due to reluctance to counter authority (automatic control).  I would have found the damn circuit breaker powering the drive screw motor and pulled it, and then reverted to manual positioning of the horizontal stabilizer for the balance of the flight.  Any malfunction of this system should have been a red X in the aircraft logs prohibiting flight until repaired - but since the system didn't exist in the pilots aircraft manuals, they could only write up the general stabilizer system and not the automatic drive function (MCAS) as they did not know it existed!  That is Boeings criminal act - failure to fully inform the pilots due to their desire for common training requirements with the older 737s.</p>

Recently (several month ago) on American Heroes Channel (USA) such fact was disclosed:<br />
In 1940 when Britain was already in war with Nazi Germany, they (GB) provided Roosevelt with allegedly stolen from Germans plan to invade and occupy Panama Canal in order to bring US to war with Germany. Hitler find it out somehow and was pissed off because Germany never had such plans. It was discovered later that British Intel fabricated that plan (fake news of 1940).<br />
Just interesting fact of the history of relationship. That is regarding lying to survive even to close ally. </p>

<p>Thank you for your insights.  At the time of my first comment, I wasn't aware that the cockpit retained trim wheels I'm used to seeing in smaller/older planes.</p>

<p>I'm used to thinking of Boeing as having a strict culture of safety in engineering.  I hope that a lot of soul-searching is taking place.</p>

<p>Has Never Say Anything done it again?</p>

<p>Even if they have when are people going to get to grips with the idea that 'code signing' is a busted security mechanism and they have to be way more proactive, especially the development side.</p>

<p>This is a quite spectacular in many ways Supply Chain attack,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/25/asus_software_update_utility_backdoor/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/25/asus_software_update_utility_backdoor/</a></p>

<p>Backend servers in Asus Taiwan got attacked in some way as a result a false update file of the right size and apparently signed by Asus's security key was put in place of a routien update download.</p>

<p>The result probably over a million computers infected with the malware.</p>

<p>Why did it not come to notice more readily by side effects etc? Well apparently it was only aimed at six hundred machines...</p>

<p>This kind of puts it in the State Level Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) catagory. Which is not to say it is a Nation State but the level of resources required is similar to that of just a few nation states, and the number of actual targets is very small. Thus the returns required are way above what most Cyber-Criminals would be capable of and also suggest it's very much geo-political in intent.</p>

<p>What would be interesting to see is an analysis of those 600 machine identities, then maybe Shodan them etc ;-)</p>

<p>EU rejects US calls over 5G.</p>

<p>I guess most know there is a trade war between the US and China, and that this is causing diplomatic silliness.</p>

<p>One such side of US trade policy appears to be accusing without supplying evidence that companies in these nations are being used to commit espionage. Which is a bit embarasing because the US has been caught red-handed doing exactly this a number of times.</p>

<p>One aspect is the US appears to think that other nations should follow suit without question. And if they do not then they get threatened / blackmailed by the US...</p>

<p>Well a little while ago Germany told the US where it could go in this respect, and to ramp up the preasure even more the EU has just come out and said it's up to individual nations within the EU to come up with their own 5G suppliers list. Which some see as a snub to the US,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/26/euro_5g_plans/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/26/euro_5g_plans/</a></p>

<p>No doubt there will be tweets after bed time on this, but it would be fun just to sit back and watch if it were not so serious.</p>

<p>There is one fun side though, any one remember the strange 'Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS)' mechanism  clauses in the previous administrations 'trade policies' over disputes?</p>

<p>Well it would have put the US Gov in the position of being judged and getting fined, because premptive 'national security' argument is not a valid reason for refusing to allow companies or products already in the US market to continue to remain...</p>

<p>AT&T CEO says China's Huawei hinders carriers from shifting suppliers for 5G<br />
David Shepardson, Reuters, March 20, 2019</p>

<blockquote>AT&T Inc Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said Wednesday that Chinaâs Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is making it very difficult for European carriers to drop the company from its supply chain for next-generation 5G wireless service.

<p><br />
"If you have deployed Huawei as your 4G network, Huawei is not allowing interoperability to 5G -- meaning if you are 4G, you are stuck with Huawei for 5G," said Stephenson at a speech in Washington. "When the Europeans say we got a problem -- that's their problem. They really don't have an option to go to somebody else."</p></blockquote>

<p>Huey Pilot wrote:</p>

<p>"I would have found the damn circuit breaker powering the drive screw motor and pulled it"</p>

<p>That's how a safe pilot thinks.  Because (as I explained above) the stabilizer is so much more powerful than the elevator in a jet transport, a mispositioned stabilizer can doom the aircraft.</p>

<p>For this reason, a runaway stabilizer (i.e., large deflection not correctable by the cockpit crew) is among the most dangerous of flight control malfunctions, and it's a matter of life and death to arrest the deflection before it becomes impossible to maintain a normal pitch attitude.</p>

<p>So if a runaway is suspected, the thing to do is pull the breaker immediately, and leave analysis of the fault for later.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this type of runaway is extremely rare.  One sad case comes to mind which was not a failure of any of the active systems, but rather mechanical breakage of the link to the stabilizer.  The pilots were able to keep their jet aloft for just a few horrifying minutes ...</p>

<p>UK cyber security officials report Huaweiâs security practices are a mess<br />
<i>Huawei never delivered on changes promised years ago, National Cybersecurity Centre reports.</i><br />
by Sean Gallagher - Mar 28, 2019</p>

<blockquote>The problems unearthed by HCSEC [Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre], however, suggest that the bigger threat is that Huawei gear could be hacked by just about anyone who cared to make an effort. And because of how Huawei runs its software development, itâs impossible to give blanket certification for any one productâs security.</blockquote>

<p>@gordo:</p>

<p>"'UK cyber security officials report Huaweiâs security practices are a mess'"</p>

<p>Yup I'm fairly sure they are, just like every other company that compeates in markets where such aspects are 'not regulated for'.</p>

<p>In fact we know both Cisco and Jupiter are in that mess atleast as badly if not worse, considerably worse. Then there are the other telco back end providers like Ericsson, lets just say 'the less said the better', as people want to sleep at night.</p>

<p>The problem is these are engineering organisations driven by over heated 'market expectations' that to be honest have now crossed a tipping point that we have seen with IoT and other markets. Speed to market now trumps the more traditional values of reliability, stability, quality, and worst of all 'good engineering practice'.</p>

<p>The fact that the NCSC is holding them to some 'ideal' the market obviously does not want nor can it afford in the face of competition kind of says just how out of touch the NCSC are with the reality of the current market.</p>

<p>If nations want telecommunications security rather than the ability to spy on others or play idiotic power politics games, then they need to 'level the playing field' and hold all potential market suppliers to the same standards by regulation with no exception. But that won't happen as long as 'home market protectionism' and 'collect it all' are in play.</p>

<p>Oh and to be honest you have to ask when the mobile telecommunications market is going to collapse in on it's self. Actually sit down and go through the 4G-LTE and 5G specs and produce a list of pros and cons. Then compare the 5G pros with what you loose from 4G-LTE pros.</p>

<p>Take a close look at how 5G falls back to 4G-LTE then the price you pay for 5G like the fact you do not get network roaming with 5G but you do with 4G-LTE. Yes I know that some bits of 5G might potentially turn into the new SMS but it's actually not that likely when you consider how 5G gets it's supposed advantages.</p>

<p>I'm still a 3G user and don't want much of what 4G let alone 4G-LTE offers. But the dirty little secret that the mobile industry is not talking about publically is 2G users. Or more correctly 2G using infrastructure that won't or can not be upgraded, things like smart meters, electricity/gas/water supply control, industrial control systems, traffic lights, vehical tracking for delivery control, road toll/tracking systems and lots more you don't see even though it's all around you. Mobile is even replacing 'emergancy radio' used by first responders and the like and the official parts use 2/3G because it's cheap. That is the nature of accountancy led infrastructure, and it's getting worse daily as people are replaced by communications technology that is expensive, then by mobile technology on the cheap, which unfortunatly is fast becoming a millstone around the Mobile Service Providers necks.</p>

<p>Hereâs proof Huawei is now a titanic consumer brand<br />
<i>Revenue from the smartphone division ballooned by 45 percent</i><br />
By Jon Porter, The Verge, Mar 29, 2019</p>

<blockquote>Huawei has announced record financial results for the last year. The companyâs revenue increased to $105 billion, a 20 percent annual rise, while profit was up by 25 percent to $8 billion. The New York Times notes that the results put Huawei in the same league as Google and Microsoft, which both passed the $100 billion milestone last year.

<p><br />
[. . .]</p>

<p>Revenue from Huaweiâs carrier technology division was weaker. Reuters notes that revenue from this unit fell by 1.3 percent last year, although Huawei explained that the fall was caused by telecoms investment cycles.<br />

<p>Ahh, but wouldn't you know it, last year Huawei started a bi-monthly patch schedule for mostly their flagship smartphones.

	    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@chrisbuetti/how-i-eat-for-free-in-nyc-using-python-automation-artificial-intelligence-and-instagram-a5ed8a1e2a10">This</a> is a fascinating hack:</p>

<blockquote><p>In today's digital age, a large Instagram audience is considered a valuable currency. I had also heard through the grapevine that I could monetize a large following -- or in my desired case -- use it to have my meals paid for. <i>So I did just that</i>.

<p>I created an Instagram page that showcased pictures of New York City's skylines, iconic spots, elegant skyscrapers Â­-- you name it. The page has amassed a following of over 25,000 users in the NYC area and it's still rapidly growing.</p>

<p>I reach out restaurants in the area either via Instagram's direct messaging or email and offer to post a positive review in return for a free entree or at least a discount. Almost every restaurant I've messaged came back at me with a compensated meal or a gift card. Most places have an allocated marketing budget for these types of things so they were happy to offer me a free dining experience in exchange for a promotion. I've ended up giving some of these meals away to my friends and family because at times I had too many queued up to use myself.</p>

<p>The beauty of this all is that <b>I automated the whole thing</b>. And I mean 100% of it. I wrote code that finds these pictures or videos, makes a caption, adds hashtags, credits where the picture or video comes from, weeds out bad or spammy posts, posts them, follows and unfollows users, likes pictures, monitors my inbox, and most importantly -- both direct messages and emails restaurants about a potential promotion. Since its inception, I haven't even really logged into the account. I spend zero time on it. It's essentially a robot that operates like a human, but the average viewer can't tell the difference. And as the programmer, I get to sit back and admire its (and my) work.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much going on in this project.</p>

	    <p>This system claims to detect <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-04/the-ai-cameras-that-can-spot-shoplifters-even-before-they-steal">suspicious behavior</a> that indicates shoplifting:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://vaak.co/about/">Vaak</a>, a Japanese startup, has developed artificial intelligence software that hunts for potential shoplifters, using footage from security cameras for fidgeting, restlessness and other potentially suspicious body language. </p></blockquote>

<p>The article has no detail or analysis, so we don't know how well it works. But this kind of thing is surely the future of video surveillance. </p>

	    <p>No one doubts that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will transform cybersecurity. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611860/ai-for-cybersecurity-is-a-hot-new-thing-and-a-dangerous-gamble/">We</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/03/artificial_inte.html">just</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-machine-learning-cybersecurity/">don't</a> <a href="https://threatpost.com/artificial-intelligence-a-cybersecurity-tool-for-good-and-sometimes-bad/137831/">know</a> <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3295596/security/ai-in-cybersecurity-what-works-and-what-doesnt.html">how</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/10/15/how-big-of-a-role-will-ai-have-in-cyber-security-over-the-next-decade/#3161f8676d1c">or</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ai-can-help-stop-cyberattacks-1537322940">when</a>. While the literature generally focuses on the different uses of AI by attackers and defenders Â­ and the resultant arms race between the two Â­ I want to talk about software vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>All software contains bugs. The reason is basically economic: The market doesn't want to pay for quality software. With a few exceptions, such as the space shuttle, the market prioritizes fast and cheap over good. The result is that any large modern software package contains hundreds or thousands of bugs.</p>

<p>Some percentage of bugs are also vulnerabilities, and a percentage of those are <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/threat-actors-prey-on-drupalgeddon-vulnerability-to-mass-compromise-websites-and-underlying-servers/">exploitable vulnerabilities</a>, meaning an attacker who knows about them can attack the underlying system in some way. And some percentage of those are discovered and used. This is why your computer and smartphone software is constantly being patched; software vendors are fixing bugs that are also vulnerabilities that have been discovered and are being used.</p>

<p>Everything would be better if software vendors found and fixed all bugs during the design and development process, but, as I said, the market doesn't reward that kind of delay and expense. AI, and machine learning in particular, has the potential to forever change this trade-off.</p>

<p>The problem of finding software vulnerabilities seems well-suited for ML systems. Going through code line by line is just the sort of tedious problem that computers excel at, if we can only teach them what a vulnerability looks like. There are challenges with that, of course, but there is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04320.pdf">already</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04497">a</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3180453">healthy</a> <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5033718">amount</a> <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/02/ndss2018_03A-2_Li_paper.pdf">of</a> <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/5/1652/pdf">academic</a> <a href="https://dspace.ou.nl/bitstream/1820/9725/1/Kronjee%20J%20IM9906%20AF%20scriptie.pdf">literature</a> on the topic -- <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-machine-learning-can-be-used-to-write-more-secure-computer-programs">and</a> <a href="http://www.vdiscover.org/">research</a> <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2018-07-machine-software-vulnerabilities.html">is</a> <a href="https://sdtimes.com/deep-neural-networks/microsoft-uses-machine-learning-combat-security-vulnerabilities/">continuing</a>. There's every reason to expect ML systems to get better at this as time goes on, and some reason to expect them to eventually become very good at it.</p>

<p>Finding vulnerabilities can benefit both attackers and defenders, but it's not a fair fight. When an attacker's ML system finds a vulnerability in software, the attacker can use it to compromise systems. When a defender's ML system finds the same vulnerability, he or she can try to patch the system or program network defenses to watch for and block code that tries to exploit it.</p>

<p>But when the same system is in the hands of a software developer who uses it to find the vulnerability before the software is ever released, the developer fixes it so it can never be used in the first place. The ML system will probably be part of his or her software design tools and will automatically find and fix vulnerabilities while the code is still in development.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a decade or so into the future. We might say to each other, "Remember those years when software vulnerabilities were a thing, before ML vulnerability finders were built into every compiler and fixed them before the software was ever released? Wow, those were crazy years." Not only is this future possible, but I would bet on it.</p>

<p>Getting from here to there will be a dangerous ride, though. Those vulnerability finders will first be unleashed on existing software, giving attackers hundreds if not thousands of vulnerabilities to exploit in real-world attacks. Sure, defenders can use the same systems, but many of today's <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/as-iot-security-concerns-rise-are-solutions-keeping-up/">Internet of Things systems</a> have no engineering teams to write patches and no ability to download and install patches. The result will be hundreds of vulnerabilities that attackers can find and use.</p>

<p>But if we look far enough into the horizon, we can see a future where <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/application-security/appscan">software vulnerabilities</a> are a thing of the past. Then we'll just have to worry about whatever <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/mayhem-darpa-cyber-grand-challenge-dod-voltron/">new and more advanced</a> attack techniques those AI systems come up with.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011497"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/03/artificial_inte.html">Artificial Intelligence and the Attack/Defense Balance</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Artificial intelligence technologies have the potential to upend the longstanding advantage that attack has over defense on the Internet. This has to do with the relative strengths and weaknesses of people and computers, how those all interplay in Internet security, and where AI technologies might change things.</p>

<p>You can divide Internet security tasks into two sets: what humans do well and what computers do well. Traditionally, computers excel at speed, scale, and scope. They can launch attacks in milliseconds and infect millions of computers. They can scan computer code to look for particular kinds of vulnerabilities, and data packets to identify particular kinds of attacks.</p>

<p>Humans, conversely, excel at thinking and reasoning. They can look at the data and distinguish a real attack from a false alarm, understand the attack as it's happening, and respond to it. They can find new sorts of vulnerabilities in systems. Humans are creative and adaptive, and can understand context.</p>

<p>Computers -- so far, at least -- are bad at what humans do well. They're not creative or adaptive. They don't understand context. They can behave irrationally because of those things.</p>

<p>Humans are slow, and get bored at repetitive tasks. They're terrible at big data analysis. They use cognitive shortcuts, and can only keep a few data points in their head at a time. They can also behave irrationally because of those things.</p>

<p>AI will allow computers to take over Internet security tasks from humans, and then do them faster and at scale. Here are possible AI capabilities:</p>

<ul><li>Discovering new vulnerabilitiesÂ­ -- and, more importantly, new types of vulnerabilitiesÂ­ in systems, both by the offense to exploit and by the defense to patch, and then automatically exploiting or patching them.</li>

<p><li>Reacting and adapting to an adversary's actions, again both on the offense and defense sides. This includes reasoning about those actions and what they mean in the context of the attack and the environment.</li></p>

<p><li>Abstracting lessons from individual incidents, generalizing them across systems and networks, and applying those lessons to increase attack and defense effectiveness elsewhere.</li></p>

<p><li>Identifying strategic and tactical trends from large datasets and using those trends to adapt attack and defense tactics.</li></ul>

<p>That's an incomplete list. I don't think anyone can predict what AI technologies will be capable of. But it's not unreasonable to look at what humans do today and imagine a future where AIs are doing the same things, only at computer speeds, scale, and scope.</p>

<p>Both attack and defense will benefit from AI technologies, but I believe that AI has the capability to tip the scales more toward defense. There will be better offensive and defensive AI techniques. But here's the thing: defense is currently in a worse position than offense precisely because of the human components. Present-day attacks pit the relative advantages of computers and humans against the relative weaknesses of computers and humans. Computers moving into what are traditionally human areas will rebalance that equation.</p>

<p>Roy Amara famously said that we overestimate the short-term effects of new technologies, but underestimate their long-term effects. AI is notoriously hard to predict, so many of the details I speculate about are likely to be wrongÂ­ -- and AI is likely to introduce new asymmetries that we can't foresee. But AI is the most promising technology I've seen for bringing defense up to par with offense. For Internet security, that will change everything.</p>

	    <p>Researchers <a href="http://blog.caranddriver.com/researchers-find-a-malicious-way-to-meddle-with-autonomous-cars/">found</a> that they could confuse the road sign detection algorithms of self-driving cars by adding stickers to the signs on the road. They could, for example, cause a car to think that a stop sign is a 45 mph speed limit sign. The changes are subtle, though -- look at the photo from the article.</p>

<p>Research paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08945">Robust Physical-World Attacks on Machine Learning Models</a>," by Ivan Evtimov, Kevin Eykholt, Earlence Fernandes, Tadayoshi Kohno, Bo Li, Atul Prakash, Amir Rahmati, and Dawn Song:

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Deep neural network-based classifiers are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that can fool them into misclassifying their input through the addition of small-magnitude perturbations. However, recent studies have demonstrated that such adversarial examples are not very effective in the physical world--they either completely fail to cause misclassification or only work in restricted cases where a relatively complex image is perturbed and printed on paper. In this paper we propose a new attack algorithm--Robust Physical Perturbations (RP2)-- that generates perturbations by taking images under different conditions into account. Our algorithm can create spatially-constrained perturbations that mimic vandalism or art to reduce the likelihood of detection by a casual observer. We show that adversarial examples generated by RP2 achieve high success rates under various conditions for real road sign recognition by using an evaluation methodology that captures physical world conditions. We physically realized and evaluated two attacks, one that causes a Stop sign to be misclassified as a Speed Limit sign in 100% of the testing conditions, and one that causes a Right Turn sign to be misclassified as either a Stop or Added Lane sign in 100% of the testing conditions.</p></blockquote>

To achieve this, ARL is requesting proposals that address three key Research Areas (RAs):

<p>RA1: Distributed Intelligence: Establish the theoretical foundations of multi-faceted distributed networked intelligent systems combining autonomous agents, sensors, tactical super-computing, knowledge bases in the tactical cloud, and human experts to acquire and apply knowledge to affect and inform decisions of the collective team.</p>

<p>RA2: Heterogeneous Group Control:  Develop theory and algorithms for control of large autonomous teams with varying levels of heterogeneity and modularity across sensing, computing, platforms, and degree of autonomy.</p>

<p>RA3: Adaptive and Resilient Behaviors: Develop theory and experimental methods for heterogeneous teams to carry out tasks under the dynamic and varying conditions in the physical world.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>This article <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-will-make-forging-anything-entirely-too-easy/">argues</a> that AI technologies will make image, audio, and video forgeries much easier in the future.</p>

<blockquote><p>Combined, the trajectory of cheap, high-quality media forgeries is worrying. At the current pace of progress, it may be as little as two or three years before realistic audio forgeries are good enough to fool the untrained ear, and only five or 10 years before forgeries can fool at least some types of forensic analysis. When tools for producing fake video perform at higher quality than today's CGI and are simultaneously available to untrained amateurs, these forgeries might comprise a large part of the information ecosystem. The growth in this technology will transform the meaning of evidence and truth in domains across journalism, government communications, testimony in criminal justice, and, of course, national security.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am not worried about fooling the "untrained ear," and more worried about fooling forensic analysis. But there's an arms race here. Recording technologies will get more sophisticated, too, making their outputs harder to forge. Still, I agree that the advantage will go to the forgers and not the forgery detectors.</p>

	    <p>A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-shows-programmers-will-take-the-easy-way-out-and-not-implement-proper-password-security/">university study</a> confirmed the obvious: if you pay a random bunch of freelance programmers a small amount of money to write security software, they're not going to do a very good job at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>In an experiment that involved 43 programmers hired via the Freelancer.com platform, University of Bonn academics have discovered that developers tend to take the easy way out and write code that stores user passwords in an unsafe manner.

<p>For their study, the German academics asked a group of 260 Java programmers to write a user registration system for a fake social network.</p>

<p>Of the 260 developers, only 43 took up the job, which involved using technologies such as Java, JSF, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL to create the user registration component.</p>

<p>Of the 43, academics paid half of the group with â¬100, and the other half with â¬200, to determine if higher pay made a difference in the implementation of password security features.</p>

<p>Further, they divided the developer group a second time, prompting half of the developers to store passwords in a secure manner, and leaving the other half to store passwords in their preferred method -- hence forming four quarters of developers paid â¬100 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P100), developers paid â¬200 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P200), devs paid â¬100 but not prompted for password security (N100), and those paid â¬200 but not prompted for password security (N200).</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't know why anyone would expect this group of people to implement a good secure password system. Look at how they were hired. Look at the scope of the project. Look at what they were paid. I'm sure they grabbed the first thing they found on GitHub that did the job.</p>

<p>I'm not very impressed with the study or its conclusions.</p>

	    <p>Researchers have found a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zmakk3/researchers-find-critical-backdoor-in-swiss-online-voting-system"> critical flaw</a> in the Swiss Internet voting system. I was going to write an essay about how this demonstrates that Internet voting is a stupid idea and should never be attempted -- and that this system in particular should never be deployed, even if the found flaw is fixed -- but Cory Doctorow <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/03/13/principal-agent-problems.html">beat me to it</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The belief that companies can be trusted with this power defies all logic, but it persists. Someone found Swiss Post's embrace of the idea too odious to bear, and they leaked the source code that Swiss Post had shared under its nondisclosure terms, and then an international team of some of the world's top security experts (including some of our favorites, like <a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22matthew%20green%22">Matthew Green</a>) set about analyzing that code, and (as every security expert who doesn't work for an e-voting company has predicted since the beginning of time), they found an incredibly powerful bug that would allow a single untrusted party at Swiss Post to undetectably alter the election results.

<p>And, as everyone who's ever advocated for the right of security researchers to speak in public without permission from the companies whose products they were assessing has predicted since the beginning of time, Swiss Post and Scytl downplayed the importance of this objectively very, very, very important bug. Swiss Post's position is that since the bug only allows elections to be stolen by Swiss Post employees, it's not a big deal, because Swiss Post employees wouldn't steal an election.</p>

<p>But when Swiss Post agreed to run the election, they promised an e-voting system based on "zero knowledge" proofs that would allow voters to trust the outcome of the election <i>without</i> having to trust Swiss Post. Swiss Post is now moving the goalposts, saying that it wouldn't be such a big deal if you had to trust Swiss Post implicitly to trust the outcome of the election.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, "Well, what <i>is</i> the big deal? If you don't trust the people administering an election, you can't trust the election's outcome, right?" Not really: we design election systems so that multiple, uncoordinated people all act as checks and balances on each other. To suborn a well-run election takes massive coordination at many polling- and counting-places, as well as independent scrutineers from different political parties, as well as outside observers, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Read the whole thing. It's excellent.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011962"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/on_the_security_1.html">On the Security of Password Managers</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>There's <a href="https://www.securityevaluators.com/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/">new research</a> on the security of password managers, specifically 1Password, Dashlane, KeePass, and Lastpass. This work specifically looks at password leakage on the host computer. That is, does the password manager accidentally leave plaintext copies of the password lying around memory?</p>

<blockquote><p>All password managers we examined sufficiently secured user secrets while in a "not running" state. That is, if a password database were to be extracted from disk and if a strong master password was used, then brute forcing of a password manager would be computationally prohibitive.

<p>Each password manager also attempted to scrub secrets from memory. But residual buffers remained that contained secrets, most likely due to memory leaks, lost memory references, or complex GUI frameworks which do not expose internal memory management mechanisms to sanitize secrets.</p>

<p>This was most evident in 1Password7 where secrets, including the master password and its associated secret key, were present in both a locked and unlocked state. This is in contrast to 1Password4, where at most, a single entry is exposed in a "running unlocked" state and the master password exists in memory in an obfuscated form, but is easily recoverable. If 1Password4 scrubbed the master password memory region upon successful unlocking, it would comply with all proposed security guarantees we outlined earlier.</p>

<p>This paper is not meant to criticize specific password manager implementations; however, it is to establish a reasonable minimum baseline which all password managers should comply with. It is evident that attempts are made to scrub and sensitive memory in all password managers. However, each password manager fails in implementing proper secrets sanitization for various reasons.</p></blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>LastPass obfuscates the master password while users are typing in the entry, and when the password manager enters an unlocked state, database entries are only decrypted into memory when there is user interaction. However, ISE reported that these entries persist in memory after the software enters a locked state. It was also possible for the researchers to extract the master password and interacted-with password entries due to a memory leak. 

<p>KeePass scrubs the master password from memory and is not recoverable. However, errors in workflows permitted the researchers from extracting credential entries which have been interacted with. In the case of Windows APIs, sometimes, various memory buffers which contain decrypted entries may not be scrubbed correctly.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether this is a big deal or not depends on whether you consider your computer to be trusted.</p>

<p>Several people have emailed me to ask why my own <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/">Password Safe</a> was not included in the evaluation, and whether it has the same vulnerabilities. My guess about the former is that Password Safe isn't as popular as the others. (This is for two reasons: 1) I don't publicize it very much, and 2) it doesn't have an easy way to synchronize passwords across devices or otherwise store password data in the cloud.) As to the latter: we tried to code Password Safe not to leave plaintext passwords lying around in memory.</p>

<p>So, Independent Security Evaluators: take a look at <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/">Password Safe</a>.</p>

<p>Also, remember the vulnerabilities found in many cloud-based password managers <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/09/security_of_pas.html">back in 2014</a>?</p>

	    <p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/10/security_flaws_2.html">A year ago</a>, the Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/watchout-rapport-october-2017.pdf">published</a> an excellent security analysis of children's GPS-connected smart watches. The security was terrible. Not only could parents track the children, anyone else could also track the children.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/gps-watch-issues-again/">recent analysis</a> checked if anything had improved after that torrent of bad press. Short answer: no.</p>

<blockquote><p>Guess what: a train wreck. Anyone could access the entire database, including real time child location, name, parents details etc. Not just Gator watches either -- the same back end covered multiple brands and tens of thousands of watches

<p>The Gator web backend was passing the user level as a parameter. Changing that value to another number gave super admin access throughout the platform. The system failed to validate that the user had the appropriate permission to take admin control!</p>

<p>This means that an attacker could get full access to all account information and all watch information. They could view any user of the system and any device on the system, including its location. They could manipulate everything and even change users' emails/passwords to lock them out of their watch.</p>

<p>In fairness, upon our reporting of the vulnerability to them, Gator got it fixed in 48 hours.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a lesson in the limits of naming and shaming: publishing vulnerabilities in an effort to get companies to improve their security. If a company is specifically named, it is likely to improve the specific vulnerability described. But that is unlikely to translate into improved security practices in the future. If an industry, or product category, is named generally, nothing is likely to happen. This is one of the reasons I am a <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">proponent of regulation</a>.</p>

	    <p>Good <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/opinion/cellphones-security-spying.html">essay</a> on the inherent vulnerabilities in the cell phone standards and the market barriers to fixing them.</p>

<blockquote><p>So far, industry and policymakers have largely dragged their feet when it comes to blocking cell-site simulators and SS7 attacks. Senator Ron Wyden, one of the few lawmakers vocal about this issue, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/24/fbi-surveillance-devices-may-interfere-with-calls-us-senator-says/">sent a letter in August</a> encouraging the Department of Justice to "be forthright with federal courts about the disruptive nature of cell-site simulators." No response has ever been published.

<p>The lack of action could be because it is a big task -- there are hundreds of companies and international bodies involved in the cellular network. The other reason could be that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have a vested interest in exploiting these same vulnerabilities. But law enforcement has other effective tools that are unavailable to criminals and spies. For example, the police can work directly with phone companies, serving warrants and Title III wiretap orders. In the end, eliminating these vulnerabilities is just as valuable for law enforcement as it is for everyone else.</p>

<p>As it stands, there is no government agency that has the power, funding and mission to fix the problems. Large companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Google and Apple have not been public about their efforts, if any exist.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Due to ever-evolving technological advances, manufacturers are connecting consumer goodsÂ­ -- from toys to light bulbs to major appliancesÂ­ -- to the Internet at breakneck speeds. This is the Internet of Things, and it's a security nightmare.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things fuses products with communications technology to make daily life more effortless. Think Amazon's Alexa, which not only answers questions and plays music but allows you to control your home's lights and thermostat. Or the current generation of implanted pacemakers, which can both receive commands and send information to doctors over the Internet.</p>

<p>But like nearly all innovation, there are risks involved. And for products born out of the Internet of Things, this means the risk of having personal information stolen or devices being overtaken and controlled remotely. For devices that affect the world in a direct physical manner -- Â­cars, pacemakers, thermostatsÂ­ -- the risks include loss of life and property.</p>

<p>By developing more advanced security features and building them into these products, hacks can be avoided. The problem is that there is no monetary incentive for companies to invest in the cybersecurity measures needed to keep their products secure. Consumers will buy products without proper security features, unaware that their information is vulnerable. And current liability laws make it hard to hold companies accountable for shoddy software security.</p>

<p>It falls upon lawmakers to create laws that protect consumers. While the US government is largely absent in this area of consumer protection, the state of California has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17874768/california-iot-smart-device-cybersecurity-bill-sb-327-signed-law">stepped</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/30/california-connected-device-laws/">in</a> and started regulating the Internet of Things, or "IoT" devices sold in the stateÂ­ -- and the effects will soon be felt worldwide.</p>

<p>California's new <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327">SB 327 law</a>, which will take effect in January 2020, requires all "connected devices" to have a "reasonable security feature." The good news is that the term "connected devices" is broadly defined to include just about everything connected to the Internet. The not-so-good news is that "reasonable security" remains defined such that companies trying to avoid compliance can argue that the law is unenforceable.</p>

<p>The legislation requires that security features must be able to protect the device and the information on it from a variety of threats and be appropriate to both the nature of the device and the information it collects. California's attorney general will interpret the law and define the specifics, which will surely be the subject of much lobbying by tech companies.</p>

<p>There's just one specific in the law that's not subject to the attorney general's interpretation: default passwords are not allowed. This is a good thing; they are a terrible security practice. But it's just one of dozens of awful "security" measures commonly found in IoT devices.</p>

<p>This law is not a <a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/09/californias-bad-iot-law.html#.W-SaLNVKhhE">panacea</a>. But we have to start somewhere, and it is a start.</p>

<p>Though the legislation covers only the state of California, its effects will reach much further. All of usÂ­ -- in the United States or elsewhereÂ­ -- are likely to benefit because of the way software is written and sold.</p>

<p>Automobile manufacturers sell their cars worldwide, but they are customized for local markets. The car you buy in the United States is different from the same model <a href="https://www.export.gov/article?id=Mexico-Automotive-Parts-and-Supplies">sold in Mexico</a>, because the local environmental laws are not the same and manufacturers optimize engines based on where the product will be sold. The economics of building and selling automobiles easily allows for this differentiation.</p>

<p>But software is different. Once California forces minimum security standards on IoT devices, manufacturers will have to rewrite their software to comply. At that point, it won't make sense to have two versions: one for California and another for everywhere else. It's much easier to maintain the single, more secure version and sell it everywhere.</p>

<p>The European General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://eugdpr.org/">GDPR</a>), which implemented the annoying warnings and agreements that pop up on websites, is another example of a law that extends well beyond physical borders. You might have noticed an increase in websites that force you to acknowledge you've read and agreed to the website's privacy policies. This is because it is tricky to differentiate between users who are subject to the protections of the GDPRÂ­ -- people physically in the European Union, and EU citizens wherever they are -- Â­and those who are not. It's easier to extend the protection to everyone.</p>

<p>Once this kind of sorting is possible, companies will, in all likelihood, return to their profitable surveillance capitalism practices on those who are still fair game. Surveillance is still the primary business model of the Internet, and companies want to spy on us and our activities as much as they can so they can sell us more things and monetize what they know about our behavior.</p>

<p>Insecurity is profitable only if you can get away with it worldwide. Once you can't, you might as well make a virtue out of necessity. So everyone will benefit from the California regulation, as they would from similar security regulations enacted in any market around the world large enough to matter, just like everyone will <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3254511">benefit</a> from the portion of GDPR compliance that involves data security.</p>

<p>Most importantly, laws like these spur innovations in cybersecurity. Right now, we have a market failure. Because the courts have traditionally not held software manufacturers <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/114973/bad-code-should-software-makers-pay-part-1">liable for vulnerabilities</a>, and because consumers don't have the expertise to differentiate between a secure product and an insecure one, manufacturers have prioritized low prices, getting devices out on the market quickly and additional features over security.</p>

<p>But once a government steps in and imposes more stringent security regulations, companies have an incentive to meet those standards as quickly, cheaply, and effectively as possible. This means more security innovation, because now there's a market for new ideas and new products. We've seen this pattern again and again in safety and security engineering, and we'll see it with the Internet of Things as well.</p>

<p>IoT devices are more <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/01/the-internet-of-things-dangerous-future-bruce-schneier.html">dangerous</a> than our traditional computers because they sense the world around us, and affect that world in a direct physical manner. Increasing the cybersecurity of these devices is paramount, and it's heartening to see both individual states and the European Union step in where the US federal government is abdicating responsibility. But we need more, and soon.</p>

	    <p><i>Consumer Reports</i> is starting to evaluate the security of IoT devices. As part of that, it's <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/d-link-camera-poses-data-security-risk--consumer-reports-finds/">reviewing</a> wireless home-security cameras.</p>

<p>It found significant security vulnerabilities in D-Link cameras:</p>

<blockquote><p>In contrast, D-Link doesn't store video from the DCS-2630L in the cloud. Instead, the camera has its own, onboard web server, which can deliver video to the user in different ways.

<p>Users can view the video using an app, mydlink Lite. The video is encrypted, and it travels from the camera through D-Link's corporate servers, and ultimately to the user's phone. Users can also access the same encrypted video feed through a company web page, <a href="https://www.mydlink.com/entrance">mydlink.com</a>. Those are both secure methods of accessing the video.</p>

<p>But the D-Link camera also lets you bypass the D-Link corporate servers and access the video directly through a web browser on a laptop or other device. If you do this, the web server on the camera doesn't encrypt the video.</p>

<p>If you set up this kind of remote access, the camera and unencrypted video is open to the web. They could be discovered by anyone who finds or guesses the camera's IP addressÂ­ -- and if you haven't set a strong password, a hacker might find it easy to gain access.</p></blockquote>

<p>The real news is that <i>Consumer Reports</i> is able to put pressure on device manufacturers:</p>

<blockquote><p>In response to a Consumer Reports query, D-Link said that security would be tightened through <a href="https://support.dlink.com/">updates this fall</a>. Consumer Reports will evaluate those updates once they are available. </p></blockquote>

<p>This is the sort of sustained pressure we need on IoT device manufacturers.</p>

	    <p>Interesting research: "<a href="https://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/909275/draft-paper_1.pdf">Self-encrypting deception: weaknesses in the encryption of solid state drives (SSDs)</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We have analyzed the hardware full-disk encryption of several SSDs by reverse engineering their firmware. In theory, the security guarantees offered by hardware encryption are similar to or better than software implementations. In reality, we found that many hardware implementations have critical security weaknesses, for many models allowing for complete recovery of the data without knowledge of any secret. BitLocker, the encryption software built into Microsoft Windows will rely exclusively on hardware full-disk encryption if the SSD advertises supported for it. Thus, for these drives, data protected by BitLocker is also compromised. This challenges the view that hardware encryption is preferable over software encryption. We conclude that one should not rely solely on hardware encryption offered by SSDs.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>This is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-bought-used-voting-machines-on-ebay/">not surprising</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>This year, I bought two more machines to see if security had improved. To my dismay, I discovered that the newer model machines -- those that were used in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/2016-election/">2016 election</a> -- are running Windows CE and have USB ports, along with other components, that make them even easier to exploit than the older ones. Our voting machines, billed as "next generation," and still in use today, are worse than they were beforeÂ­ -- dispersed, disorganized, and susceptible to manipulation. </p></blockquote>

<p>Cory Doctorow's <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/10/25/windows-ce-and-usb.html">comment</a> is correct:</p>

<blockquote><p>Voting machines are terrible in every way: the companies that make them <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/07/18/election-systems-and-software.html">lie like crazy</a> about their security, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/09/04/what-could-go-worng.html">insist on insecure designs</a>, and produce machines that are so insecure that <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/09/28/gop-killed-funding.html">it's easier to hack a voting machine</a> than it is to use it to vote.</p></blockquote>

<p>I blame both the secrecy of the industry and the ignorance of most voting officials. And it's not <a href="https://www.verifiedvoting.org/">getting better</a>.</p>

	    <p>In an <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/12/what-the-marriott-breach-says-about-security/">excellent blog post</a>, Brian Krebs makes clear something I have been saying for a while:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Likewise for individuals, it pays to accept two unfortunate and harsh realities:

<blockquote><p>Reality #1: Bad guys already have access to personal data points that you may believe should be secret but which nevertheless aren't, including your credit card information, Social Security number, mother's maiden name, date of birth, address, previous addresses, phone number, and yes Â­ even your credit file.

<p>Reality #2: Any data point you share with a company will in all likelihood eventually be hacked, lost, leaked, stolen or sold Â­ usually through no fault of your own. And if you're an American, it means (at least for the time being) your recourse to do anything about that when it does happen is limited or nil.</p></blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Once you've owned both of these realities, you realize that expecting another company to safeguard your security is a fool's errand, and that it makes far more sense to focus instead on doing everything you can to proactively prevent identity thieves, malicious hackers or other ne'er-do-wells from abusing access to said data.</p></blockquote>

<p>His advice is good.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a010782"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/09/organizational_1.html">Organizational Doxing and Disinformation</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>In the past few years, the devastating effects of hackers breaking into an organization's network, stealing confidential data, and publishing everything have been made clear. It happened to the Democratic National Committee, to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/12/11/massive-security-breach-at-sony-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Sony</a>, to the National Security Agency, to the cyber-arms weapons manufacturer <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2015/07/massive-leak-reveals-hacking-teams-most-private-moments-in-messy-detail/">Hacking Team</a>, to the online adultery site <a href="http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/the-ashley-madison-hack-a-timeline/">Ashley Madison</a>, and to the Panamanian tax-evasion law firm <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/us/politics/leaked-documents-offshore-accounts-putin.html">Mossack Fonseca</a>.</p>

<p>This style of attack is known as <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/organizational_.html">organizational doxing</a>. The hackers, in some cases individuals and in others nation-states, are out to make political points by revealing proprietary, secret, and sometimes incriminating information. And the documents they leak do that, airing the organizations' embarrassments for everyone to see.</p>

<p>In all of these instances, the documents were real: the email conversations, still-secret product details, strategy documents, salary information, and everything else. But what if hackers were to alter documents before releasing them? This is the next step in organizational doxingÂ­ -- and the effects can be much worse.</p>

<p>It's one thing to have all of your dirty laundry aired in public for everyone to see. It's another thing entirely for someone to throw in a few choice items that aren't real.</p>

<p>Recently, Russia has started <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/world/europe/russia-sweden-disinformation.html">using forged documents</a> as part of broader disinformation campaigns, particularly in relation to Sweden's entering of a military partnership with NATO, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Forging thousands -- or more -- documents is difficult to pull off, but slipping a single forgery in an actual cache is much easier. The attack could be something subtle. Maybe a country that anonymously publishes another country's diplomatic cables wants to influence yet a third country, so adds some particularly egregious conversations about that third country. Or the next hacker who steals and publishes email <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/11/climate-hack/">from climate change researchers</a> invents a bunch of over-the-top messages to make his political point even stronger. Or it could be personal: someone dumping email from thousands of users making changes in those by a friend, relative, or lover.</p>

<p>Imagine trying to explain to the press, eager to publish the worst of the details in the documents, that everything is accurate except this particular email. Or that particular memo. That the salary document is correct except that one entry. Or that the secret customer list posted up on WikiLeaks is correct except that there's one inaccurate addition. It would be impossible. Who would believe you? No one. And you couldn't prove it.</p>

<p>It has long been easy to forge documents on the Internet. It's easy to create new ones, and modify old ones. It's easy to change things like a document's creation date, or a photograph's location information. With a little more work, pdf files and images can be altered. These changes will be undetectable. In many ways, it's surprising that this kind of manipulation hasn't been seen before. My guess is that hackers who leak documents don't have the secondary motives to make the data dumps worse than they already are, and nation-states have just gotten into the document leaking business.</p>

<p>Major newspapers do their best to verify the authenticity of leaked documents they receive from sources. They only publish the ones they know are authentic. The newspapers consult experts, and pay attention to forensics. They have tense conversations with governments, trying to get them to verify secret documents they're not actually allowed to admit even exist. This is only possible because the news outlets have ongoing relationships with the governments, and they care that they get it right. There are lots of instances where neither of these two things are true, and lots of ways to leak documents without any independent verification at all.</p>

<p>No one is talking about this, but everyone needs to be alert to the possibility. Sooner or later, the hackers who steal an organization's data are going to make changes in them before they release them. If these forgeries aren't questioned, the situations of those being hacked could be made worse, or erroneous conclusions could be drawn from the documents. When someone says that a document they have been accused of writing is forged, their arguments at least should be heard.</p>

	    <p>Goldman Sachs is going to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/02/us-google-goldman-leak-idUSKBN0F729I20140702">court</a> to demand that Google retroactively delete an e-mail it accidentally sent.</p>

<blockquote><p>The breach occurred on June 23 and included "highly confidential brokerage account information," Goldman said in a complaint filed last Friday in a New York state court in Manhattan. 

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Goldman said the contractor meant to email her report, which contained the client data, to a "gs.com" account, but instead sent it to a similarly named, unrelated "gmail.com" account.</p>

<p>The bank said it has been unable to retrieve the report or get a response from the Gmail account owner. It said a member of Google's "incident response team" reported on June 26 that the email cannot be deleted without a court order.</p>

<p>"Emergency relief is necessary to avoid the risk of inflicting a needless and massive privacy violation upon Goldman Sachs' clients, and to avoid the risk of unnecessary reputational damage to Goldman Sachs," the bank said.</p>

<p>"By contrast, Google faces little more than the minor inconvenience of intercepting a single email - an email that was indisputably sent in error," it added.</p></blockquote>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (7/7): Google <a href="http://www.scmagazine.com/google-blocks-access-to-email-to-prevent-needless-and-massive-goldman-sachs-breach/article/359291/">deleted</a> the unread e-mail, without waiting for a court order.</p>

	    <p>Rats have <a href="http://austriantimes.at/news/Around_the_World/2014-04-30/50810/Rats_Eat_Votes_In_India">destroyed</a> dozens of electronic voting machines by eating the cables.  It would have been a better story if the rats had zeroed out the machines after the votes had been cast but before they were counted, but it seems that they just ate the machines while they were in storage.</p>

<blockquote><p>The EVMs had been stored in a pre-designated strong room that was located near a wholesale wheat market, where the rats had apparently made their home.</p></blockquote>

<p>There's a general thread running through security where high-tech replacements for low-tech systems have new and unexpected failures.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (5/14):  <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/greatest-threat-to-free-and-fair-polls-in-ghaziabad-rats/">This article</a> says it was only a potential threat, and one being addressed.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a002875"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/06/cloud_computing.html">Cloud Computing</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>This year's overhyped IT concept is cloud computing. Also called software as a service (Saas), cloud computing is when you run software over the internet and access it via a browser. The Salesforce.com customer management software is an example of this. So is Google Docs. If you believe the hype, cloud computing is the future.</p>

<p>But, hype aside, <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/5/24642-the-rise-fall-and-resurrection-of-software-as-a-service/fulltext">cloud computing is nothing new</a> . It's the modern version of the timesharing model from the 1960s, which was eventually killed by the rise of the personal computer. It's what Hotmail and Gmail have been doing all these years, and it's social networking sites, remote backup companies, and remote email filtering companies such as MessageLabs. Any IT outsourcing -- network infrastructure, security monitoring, remote hosting -- is a form of cloud computing.</p>

<p>The old timesharing model arose because computers were expensive and hard to maintain. Modern computers and networks are drastically cheaper, but they're still hard to maintain. As networks have become faster, it is again easier to have someone else do the hard work. Computing has become more of a utility; users are more concerned with results than technical details, so the tech fades into the background.</p>

<p>But what about security? Isn't it more dangerous to have your email on Hotmail's servers, your spreadsheets on Google's, your personal conversations on Facebook's, and your company's sales prospects on salesforce.com's? Well, yes and no.</p>

<p>IT security is about trust. You have to trust your CPU manufacturer, your hardware, operating system and software vendors -- and your ISP. Any one of these can undermine your security: crash your systems, corrupt data, allow an attacker to get access to systems. We've spent decades dealing with worms and rootkits that target software vulnerabilities. We've worried about infected chips. But in the end, we have no choice but to blindly trust the security of the IT providers we use.</p>

<p>Saas moves the trust boundary out one step further -- you now have to also trust your software service vendors -- but it doesn't fundamentally change anything. It's just another vendor we need to trust.</p>

<p>There is one critical difference. When a computer is within your network, you can protect it with other security systems such as firewalls and IDSs. You can build a resilient system that works even if those vendors you have to trust may not be as trustworthy as you like. With any outsourcing model, whether it be cloud computing or something else, you can't. You have to trust your outsourcer completely. You not only have to trust the outsourcer's security, but its reliability, its availability, and its business continuity.</p>

<p>You don't want your critical data to be on <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/what-do-if-your-cloud-provider-disappears-508">some cloud computer that abruptly disappears</a>  because <a href="http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/cloud-computing-forerunner-facing-bankruptcy-772">its owner goes bankrupt</a> . You don't want the company you're using to be sold to your direct competitor. You don't want the company to cut corners, without warning, because times are tight. Or raise its prices and then refuse to let you have your data back. These things can happen with software vendors, but the results aren't as drastic.</p>

<p>There are two different types of cloud computing customers. The first only pays a nominal fee for these services -- and uses them for free in exchange for ads: e.g., Gmail and Facebook. These customers have no leverage with their outsourcers. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/03/journalspace-drama-all-data-lost-without-backup-company-deadpooled/">You can lose everything</a>. <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,39258170,00.htm">Companies like</a>  <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/28/gmail-disaster-reports-of-mass-email-deletions/">Google</a>  and <a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=44350">Amazon</a>  won't spend a lot of time caring. The second type of customer pays considerably for these services: to Salesforce.com, MessageLabs, managed network companies, and so on. These customers have more leverage, providing they write their service contracts correctly. Still, nothing is guaranteed.</p>

<p>Trust is a concept as old as humanity, and the solutions are the same as they have always been. Be careful who you trust, be careful what you trust them with, and be careful how much you trust them. Outsourcing is the future of computing. Eventually we'll get this right, but you don't want to be a casualty along the way.</p>

<p>This essay <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jun/04/bruce-schneier-cloud-computing">originally appeared</a> in <i>The Guardian</i>.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (6/4):  Another <a href="http://1raindrop.typepad.com/1_raindrop/2009/06/begin-the-begin-cloud-security.html">opinion</a>.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (6/5): A <a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=952">rebuttal</a>.  And an <a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=1013">apology</a> for the tone of the rebuttal.  The reason I am talking so much about cloud computing is that reporters and inverviewers keep asking me about it.  I feel kind of dragged into this whole thing.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (6/6): At the <a href="http://www.cfp2009.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Computers, Freedom, and Privacy conference</a> last week, Bob Gellman said (<a href="http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/cloudprivacy.html">this</a>, by him, is worth reading) that the nine most important words in cloud computing are: "terms of service," "location, location, location," and "provider, provider, provider" -- basically making the same point I did.  You need to make sure the terms of service you sign up to are ones you can live with.  You need to make sure the location of the provider doesn't subject you to any laws that you can't live with.  And you need to make sure your provider is someone you're willing to work with.  Basically, if you're going to give someone else your data, you need to trust them.  </p>

	    <p>They've lost 80 computers: no idea if they're stolen, or just misplaced.  Typical story&mdash;not even worth commenting on&mdash;but this great <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jXipyrzU1GKO4KQ3f4hhKyLvJvTA">comment</a> by Los Alamos explains a lot about what was wrong with their security policy:</p>

<blockquote><p>The letter, addressed to Department of Energy security officials, contends that "cyber security issues were not engaged in a timely manner" because the computer losses were treated as a "property management issue."</p></blockquote>

<p>The real risk in computer losses is the data, not the hardware.  I thought everyone knew that.</p>

<p>While visiting some friends and their new baby in the hospital last week, I noticed an interesting bit of security. To prevent infant abduction, all babies had RFID tags attached to their ankles by a bracelet. There are sensors on the doors to the maternity ward, and if a baby passes through, an alarm goes off.</p>
<p>Infant abduction is rare, but still a risk. In the last 22 years, about 233 such abductions have occurred in the United States. About 4 million babies are born each year, which means that a baby has a 1-in-375,000 chance of being abducted. Compare this with the infant mortality rate in the U.S. -- one in 145 -- and it becomes clear where the real risks are.</p>
<p>And the 1-in-375,000 chance is not today's risk. Infant abduction rates have <a href="http://www.saione.com/ispletter.htm">plummeted</a> in recent years, mostly due to education programs at hospitals.</p>
<p>So why are hospitals bothering with RFID bracelets? I think they're primarily to reassure the mothers. Many times during my friends' stay at the hospital the doctors had to take the baby away for this or that test. Millions of years of evolution have forged a strong bond between new parents and new baby; the RFID bracelets are a low-cost way to ensure that the parents are more relaxed when their baby was out of their sight.</p>
<p>Security is both a reality and a feeling. The reality of security is mathematical, based on the probability of different risks and the effectiveness of different countermeasures. We know the infant abduction rates and how well the bracelets reduce those rates. We also know the cost of the bracelets, and can thus calculate whether they're a cost-effective security measure or not. But security is also a feeling, based on individual psychological reactions to both the risks and the countermeasures. And the two things are different: You can be secure even though you don't feel secure, and you can feel secure even though you're not really secure.</p>
<p>The RFID bracelets are what I've come to call security theater: security primarily designed to make you <cite>feel</cite> more secure. I've regularly maligned security theater as a waste, but it's not always, and not entirely, so.</p>
<p>It's only a waste if you consider the reality of security exclusively. There are times when people feel less secure than they actually are. In those cases -- like with mothers and the threat of baby abduction -- a palliative countermeasure that primarily increases the feeling of security is just what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p>Tamper-resistant packaging for over-the-counter drugs started to appear in the '80s, in response to some highly publicized poisonings. As a countermeasure, it's largely security theater. It's easy to poison many foods and over-the-counter medicines right through the seal -- with a syringe, for example -- or to open and replace the seal well enough that an unwary consumer won't detect it. But in the '80s, there was a widespread fear of random poisonings in over-the-counter medicines, and tamper-resistant packaging brought people's perceptions of the risk more in line with the actual risk: minimal.</p>
<p>Much of the post-9/11 security can be explained by this as well. I've often talked about the National Guard troops in airports right after the terrorist attacks, and the fact that they had no bullets in their guns. As a security countermeasure, it made little sense for them to be there. They didn't have the training necessary to improve security at the checkpoints, or even to be another useful pair of eyes. But to reassure a jittery public that it's OK to fly, it was probably the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Security theater also addresses the ancillary risk of lawsuits. Lawsuits are ultimately decided by juries, or settled because of the threat of jury trial, and juries are going to decide cases based on their feelings as well as the facts. It's not enough for a hospital to point to infant abduction rates and rightly claim that RFID bracelets aren't worth it; the other side is going to put a weeping mother on the stand and make an emotional argument. In these cases, security theater provides real security against the legal threat.</p>
<p>Like real security, security theater has a cost. It can cost money, time, concentration, freedoms and so on. It can come at the cost of reducing the things we can do. Most of the time security theater is a bad trade-off, because the costs far outweigh the benefits. But there are instances when a little bit of security theater makes sense.</p>
<p>We make smart security trade-offs -- and by this I mean trade-offs for genuine security -- when our feeling of security closely matches the reality. When the two are out of alignment, we get security wrong. Security theater is no substitute for security reality, but, used correctly, security theater can be a way of raising our feeling of security so that it more closely matches the reality of security. It makes us feel more secure handing our babies off to doctors and nurses, buying over-the-counter medicines and flying on airplanes -- closer to how secure we should feel if we had all the facts and did the math correctly.</p>
<p>Of course, too much security theater and our feeling of security becomes greater than the reality, which is also bad. And others -- politicians, corporations and so on -- can use security theater to make us feel more secure without doing the hard work of actually making us secure. That's the usual way security theater is used, and why I so often malign it.</p>
<p>But to write off security theater completely is to ignore the feeling of security. And as long as people are involved with security trade-offs, that's never going to work.</p>

	    <p>A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-shows-programmers-will-take-the-easy-way-out-and-not-implement-proper-password-security/">university study</a> confirmed the obvious: if you pay a random bunch of freelance programmers a small amount of money to write security software, they're not going to do a very good job at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>In an experiment that involved 43 programmers hired via the Freelancer.com platform, University of Bonn academics have discovered that developers tend to take the easy way out and write code that stores user passwords in an unsafe manner.

<p>For their study, the German academics asked a group of 260 Java programmers to write a user registration system for a fake social network.</p>

<p>Of the 260 developers, only 43 took up the job, which involved using technologies such as Java, JSF, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL to create the user registration component.</p>

<p>Of the 43, academics paid half of the group with â¬100, and the other half with â¬200, to determine if higher pay made a difference in the implementation of password security features.</p>

<p>Further, they divided the developer group a second time, prompting half of the developers to store passwords in a secure manner, and leaving the other half to store passwords in their preferred method -- hence forming four quarters of developers paid â¬100 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P100), developers paid â¬200 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P200), devs paid â¬100 but not prompted for password security (N100), and those paid â¬200 but not prompted for password security (N200).</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't know why anyone would expect this group of people to implement a good secure password system. Look at how they were hired. Look at the scope of the project. Look at what they were paid. I'm sure they grabbed the first thing they found on GitHub that did the job.</p>

<p>I'm not very impressed with the study or its conclusions.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a005917"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/08/security_as_int.html">Security as Interface Guarantees</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>This is a <a href="http://noncombatant.org/2014/08/10/security-as-a-class-of-interface-guarantee/">smart and interesting blog post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I prefer to think of security as a class of interface guarantee. In particular, security guarantees are a kind of correctness guarantee. At every interface of every kind Â­ user interface, programming language syntax and semantics, in-process APIs, kernel APIs, RPC and network protocols, ceremonies Â­-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">explicit and implicit design guarantees</a> (promises, contracts) are in place, and determine the degree of âsecurityâ (however defined) the system can possibly achieve.

<p>Design guarantees might or might not actually hold in the implementation Â­-- software tends to have bugs, after all. Callers and callees can sometimes (but not always) defend themselves against untrustworthy callees and callers (respectively) in various ways that depend on the circumstances and on the nature of caller and callee. In this sense an interface is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface">attack surface</a> --Â­ but properly constructed, it can also be a defense surface.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>But also itâs an attempt to re-frame security engineering in a way that allows us to imagine more and better solutions to security problems. For example, when you frame your interface as an attack surface, you find yourself ever-so-slightly in a panic mode, and focus on how to make the surface as small as possible. Inevitably, this tends to lead to cat-and-mouseism and poor usability, seeming to reinforce the false dichotomy. If the panic is acute, it can even lead to nonsensical and undefendable interfaces, and a proliferation of false boundaries (as we saw with Windows UAC).</p>

<p>If instead we frame an interface as a defense surface, we are in a mindset that allows us to treat the interface as a shield: built for defense, <i>testable, tested,</i> covering the body; but also light-weight enough to carry and use effectively. It might seem like a semantic game; but in my experience, thinking of a boundary as a place to build a point of strength rather than thinking of it as something that must inevitably fall to attack leads to solutions that in fact withstand attack better while also functioning better for friendly callers.</p></blockquote>

<p>I also liked the <a href="https://twitter.com/rootkovska/status/498227129969295360">link</a> at the end. </p>

	    <p>Yet another side-channel attack on smartphones: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11137">Hearing your touch: A new acoustic side channel on smartphones</a>," by Ilia Shumailov, Laurent Simon, Jeff Yan, and Ross Anderson.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present the first acoustic side-channel attack that recovers what users type on the virtual keyboard of their touch-screen smartphone or tablet. When a user taps the screen with a finger, the tap generates a sound wave that propagates on the screen surface and in the air. We found the device's microphone(s) can recover this wave and "hear" the finger's touch, and the wave's distortions are characteristic of the tap's location on the screen. Hence, by recording audio through the built-in microphone(s), a malicious app can infer text as the user enters it on their device. We evaluate the effectiveness of the attack with 45 participants in a real-world environment on an Android tablet and an Android smartphone. For the tablet, we recover 61% of 200 4-digit PIN-codes within 20 attempts, even if the model is not trained with the victim's data. For the smartphone, we recover 9 words of size 7-13 letters with 50 attempts in a common side-channel attack benchmark. Our results suggest that it not always sufficient to rely on isolation mechanisms such as TrustZone to protect user input. We propose and discuss hardware, operating-system and application-level mechanisms to block this attack more effectively. Mobile devices may need a richer capability model, a more user-friendly notification system for sensor usage and a more thorough evaluation of the information leaked by the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote>

<p>This must assume a standard keyboard layout but various third party programs make that easy to change. </p>

<p>@ jkli,</p>

<blockquote>This must assume a standard keyboard layout but various third party programs make that easy to change.</blockquote>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p>Each key press is diferent to the other key presses, but importantly with out other measures it becomes the same noise each time for the same key. This makes it the equivalent of a "simple substitution cipher" like the school child "pig-pen code". This acoustic substitution cipher and an equivalent gravatometer cipher are well know side channels in certain quaters. And can be broken in as little as 20 keypresses.</p>

<p>There are ways to take counter measures, but unless you get out the wire cutters / soldering iron to disconnect both the microphone and speaker (which can be used as a microphone) your only other options are various types of random noise generator or making the keyboard layout randomised very frequently like every key press...</p>

<p>@ All,</p>

<p>Yes I'm still alive but for various reasons I'm not going to be showing up very often. Thank you to all who have shown concern about me and the others who have dropped off this blog, it has made my ears glow more than a little pink. </p>

<p>@ Mitch</p>

<p>No, I think it should not work on a swipe keyboard at least not as easily as an accelerometer-based approach.  However no one types passwords on a swipe keyboard, up to my knowledge.</p>

<p>An easy workaround to this thread would be putting the keys on the pin pad on a random order each time a pin must be typed.</p>

<p>Surely there are easier ways to grab the data than this. More effort put into getting a standard keylogger or screen grab software onto the device would likely pay off better.</p>

<p>@0laf T. Hairy:</p>

<p>"Surely there are easier ways to grab the data than this."</p>

<p>But with every one 'grabing' at the low hanging fruit it quickly ceases to be available, so they then have to work that bit harder to get a 'free lunch'.</p>

<p>If it's your tree they are stealing your apples from, maybe knowing how apples get 'grabbed' at all levels is something you want to stop, that way they steal your neighbors apples instead, or even go pay for their lunch, likevthey are supposed to do.<br />

<p>@Petre Peter, you are right -- it is asking for your permissions, however, as we point in the paper, a lot of users simply give the applications access to everything that applications ask for. And applications ask for everything justifying that at some point in the future they will have a use for it. <br />
Furthermore, one can imagine scenarios with legitimate sensor usage -- imagine you talking on the phone with a bank, who asks you to open their app and confirm something. You do so and enter the app PIN (as for example Barclays asks you). If the recording of you typing in your PIN, we can decode this PIN with the knowledge of the phone model.</p>

<p>@Clive Robinson</p>

<p>Good to hear from you. I too have had to cut back for non-optional reasons.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@chrisbuetti/how-i-eat-for-free-in-nyc-using-python-automation-artificial-intelligence-and-instagram-a5ed8a1e2a10">This</a> is a fascinating hack:</p>

<blockquote><p>In today's digital age, a large Instagram audience is considered a valuable currency. I had also heard through the grapevine that I could monetize a large following -- or in my desired case -- use it to have my meals paid for. <i>So I did just that</i>.

<p>I created an Instagram page that showcased pictures of New York City's skylines, iconic spots, elegant skyscrapers Â­-- you name it. The page has amassed a following of over 25,000 users in the NYC area and it's still rapidly growing.</p>

<p>I reach out restaurants in the area either via Instagram's direct messaging or email and offer to post a positive review in return for a free entree or at least a discount. Almost every restaurant I've messaged came back at me with a compensated meal or a gift card. Most places have an allocated marketing budget for these types of things so they were happy to offer me a free dining experience in exchange for a promotion. I've ended up giving some of these meals away to my friends and family because at times I had too many queued up to use myself.</p>

<p>The beauty of this all is that <b>I automated the whole thing</b>. And I mean 100% of it. I wrote code that finds these pictures or videos, makes a caption, adds hashtags, credits where the picture or video comes from, weeds out bad or spammy posts, posts them, follows and unfollows users, likes pictures, monitors my inbox, and most importantly -- both direct messages and emails restaurants about a potential promotion. Since its inception, I haven't even really logged into the account. I spend zero time on it. It's essentially a robot that operates like a human, but the average viewer can't tell the difference. And as the programmer, I get to sit back and admire its (and my) work.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much going on in this project.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011963"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/attacking_soldi.html">Attacking Soldiers on Social Media</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>A research group at NATO's Strategic Communications Center of Excellence catfished soldiers involved in an European military exercise -- we don't know what country they were from -- to demonstrate the power of the attack technique.</p>

<blockquote><p>Over four weeks, the researchers developed fake pages and closed groups on Facebook that looked like they were associated with the military exercise, as well as profiles impersonating service members both real and imagined.

<p>To recruit soldiers to the pages, they used targeted Facebook advertising. Those pages then promoted the closed groups the researchers had created. Inside the groups, the researchers used their phony accounts to ask the real service members questions about their battalions and their work. They also used these accounts to "friend" service members. According to the report, Facebook's Suggested Friends feature proved helpful in surfacing additional targets.</p>

<p>The researchers also tracked down service members' Instagram and Twitter accounts and searched for other information available online, some of which a bad actor might be able to exploit. "We managed to find quite a lot of data on individual people, which would include sensitive information," Biteniece says. "Like a serviceman having a wife and also being on dating apps."</p>

<p>By the end of the exercise, the researchers identified 150 soldiers, found the locations of several battalions, tracked troop movements, and compelled service members to engage in "undesirable behavior," including leaving their positions against orders.</p>

<p>"Every person has a button. For somebody there's a financial issue, for somebody it's a very appealing date, for somebody it's a family thing," Sarts says. "It's varied, but everybody has a button. The point is, what's openly available online is sufficient to know what that is."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the future of warfare. It's one of the reasons China stole all of that data from the Office of Personal Management. If indeed a country's intelligence service <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/equifax-mystery-where-is-the-data.html">was behind</a> the Equifax attack, this is why they did it.</p>

<p>Go back and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/08/future_cyberwar.html">read this scenario</a> from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Why wouldn't a country intent on starting a war do it that way?</p>

<blockquote><p>If we ask tech companies to fix ancient societal ills that are now reflected online with moderation, then we will end up with huge, democratically-unaccountable organizations controlling our lives in ways we never intended. And those ills will still exist below the surface.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011854"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/11/how_surveillanc_1.html">How Surveillance Inhibits Freedom of Expression</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>In my book <cite>Data and Goliath</cite>, I write about the value of privacy. I talk about how it is essential for political liberty and justice, and for commercial fairness and equality. I talk about how it increases personal freedom and individual autonomy, and how the lack of it makes us all less secure. But this is probably the most important argument as to why society as a whole must protect privacy: it allows society to progress.</p>

<p>We know that surveillance has a chilling effect on freedom. People change their behavior when they live their lives under surveillance. They are less likely to speak freely and act individually. They self-censor. They become conformist. This is obviously true for government surveillance, but is true for corporate surveillance as well. We simply aren't as willing to be our individual selves when others are watching.</p>

<p>Let's take an example: hearing that parents and children are being separated as they cross the US border, you want to learn more. You visit the website of an international immigrants' rights group, a fact that is available to the government through mass Internet surveillance. You sign up for the group's mailing list, another fact that is potentially available to the government. The group then calls or e-mails to invite you to a local meeting. Same. Your license plates can be collected as you drive to the meeting; your face can be scanned and identified as you walk into and out of the meeting. If, instead of visiting the website, you visit the group's Facebook page, Facebook knows that you did and that feeds into its profile of you, available to advertisers and political activists alike. Ditto if you like their page, share a link with your friends, or just post about the issue.</p>

<p>Maybe you are an immigrant yourself, documented or not. Or maybe some of your family is. Or maybe you have friends or coworkers who are. How likely are you to get involved if you know that your interest and concern can be gathered and used by government and corporate actors? What if the issue you are interested in is pro- or anti-gun control, anti-police violence or in support of the police? Does that make a difference?</p>

<p>Maybe the issue doesn't matter, and you would never be afraid to be identified and tracked based on your political or social interests. But even if you are so fearless, you probably know someone who has more to lose, and thus more to fear, from their personal, sexual, or political beliefs being exposed.</p>

<p>This isn't just hypothetical. In the months and years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many of us censored what we spoke about on social media or what we searched on the Internet. We know from a 2013 PEN study that writers in the United States self-censored their browsing habits out of fear the government was watching. And this isn't exclusively an American event; Internet self-censorship is prevalent across the globe, China being a prime example.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this fear stagnates society in two ways. The first is that the presence of surveillance means society cannot experiment with new things without fear of reprisal, and that means those experimentsÂ­ -- if found to be inoffensive or even essential to society -- Â­cannot slowly become commonplace, moral, and then legal. If surveillance nips that process in the bud, change never happens. All social progressÂ­ -- from ending slavery to fighting for women's rightsÂ­ -- began as ideas that were, quite literally, dangerous to assert. Yet without the ability to safely develop, discuss, and eventually act on those assertions, our society would not have been able to further its democratic values in the way that it has.</p>

<p>Consider the decades-long fight for gay rights around the world. Within our lifetimes we have made enormous strides to combat homophobia and increase acceptance of queer folks' right to marry. Queer relationships slowly progressed from being viewed as immoral and illegal, to being viewed as somewhat moral and tolerated, to finally being accepted as moral and legal.</p>

<p>In the end, it was the public nature of those activities that eventually slayed the bigoted beast, but the ability to act in private was essential in the beginning for the early experimentation, community building, and organizing.</p>

<p>Marijuana legalization is going through the same process: it's currently sitting between somewhat moral, andÂ­ -- depending on the state or country in question -- Â­tolerated and legal. But, again, for this to have happened, someone decades ago had to try pot and realize that it wasn't really harmful, either to themselves or to those around them. Then it had to become a counterculture, and finally a social and political movement. If pervasive surveillance meant that those early pot smokers would have been arrested for doing something illegal, the movement would have been squashed before inception. Of course the story is more complicated than that, but the ability for members of society to privately smoke weed was essential for putting it on the path to legalization.</p>

<p>We don't yet know which subversive ideas and illegal acts of today will become political causes and positive social change tomorrow, but they're around. And they require privacy to germinate. Take away that privacy, and we'll have a much harder time breaking down our inherited moral assumptions.</p>

<p>The second way surveillance hurts our democratic values is that it encourages society to make more things illegal. Consider the things you doÂ­ -- the different things each of us doesÂ­ -- that portions of society find immoral. Not just recreational drugs and gay sex, but gambling, dancing, public displays of affection. All of us do things that are deemed immoral by some groups, but are not illegal because they don't harm anyone. But it's important that these things can be done out of the disapproving gaze of those who would otherwise rally against such practices.</p>

<p>If there is no privacy, there will be pressure to change. Some people will recognize that their morality isn't necessarily the morality of everyoneÂ­ -- and that that's okay. But others will start demanding legislative change, or using less legal and more violent means, to force others to match their idea of morality.</p>

<p>It's easy to imagine the more conservative (in the small-c sense, not in the sense of the named political party) among us getting enough power to make illegal what they would otherwise be forced to witness. In this way, privacy helps protect the rights of the minority from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>This is how we got Prohibition in the 1920s, and if we had had today's surveillance capabilities in the 1920s, it would have been far more effectively enforced. Recipes for making your own spirits would have been much harder to distribute. Speakeasies would have been impossible to keep secret. The criminal trade in illegal alcohol would also have been more effectively suppressed. There would have been less discussion about the harms of Prohibition, less "what if we didn't?" thinking. Political organizing might have been difficult. In that world, the law might have stuck to this day.</p>

<p>China serves as a cautionary tale. The country has long been a world leader in the ubiquitous surveillance of its citizens, with the goal not of crime prevention but of social control. They are about to further enhance their system, giving every citizen a "social credit" rating. The details are yet unclear, but the general concept is that people will be rated based on their activities, both online and off. Their political comments, their friends and associates, and everything else will be assessed and scored. Those who are conforming, obedient, and apolitical will be given high scores. People without those scores will be denied privileges like access to certain schools and foreign travel. If the program is half as far-reaching as early reports indicate, the subsequent pressure to conform will be enormous. This social surveillance system is precisely the sort of surveillance designed to maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>For social norms to change, people need to deviate from these inherited norms. People need the space to try alternate ways of living without risking arrest or social ostracization. People need to be able to read critiques of those norms without anyone's knowledge, discuss them without their opinions being recorded, and write about their experiences without their names attached to their words. People need to be able to do things that others find distasteful, or even immoral. The minority needs protection from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>Privacy makes all of this possible. Privacy encourages social progress by giving the few room to experiment free from the watchful eye of the many. Even if you are not personally chilled by ubiquitous surveillance, the society you live in is, and the personal costs are unequivocal.</p>

	    <p>From <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-co-1828476051">Kashmir Hill</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Facebook is not content to use the contact information you willingly put into your Facebook profile for advertising. It is also using contact information you handed over for security purposes and contact information you didn't hand over at all, but that was collected from other people's contact books, a hidden layer of details Facebook has about you that I've come to call "shadow contact information." I managed to place an ad in front of Alan Mislove by targeting his shadow profile. This means that the junk email address that you hand over for discounts or for shady online shopping is likely associated with your account and being used to target you with ads.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here's the research <a href="https://mislove.org/publications/PII-PETS.pdf">paper</a>. Hill again:</p>

<blockquote><p>They found that when a user gives Facebook a phone number for two-factor authentication or in order to receive alerts about new log-ins to a user's account, that phone number became targetable by an advertiser within a couple of weeks. So users who want their accounts to be more secure are forced to make a privacy trade-off and allow advertisers to more easily find them on the social network.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Interesting research: "<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfamus/papers/icwsm18.pdf">You are your Metadata: Identification and Obfuscation of Social Media Users using Metadata Information</a>," by Beatrice Perez, Mirco Musolesi, and Gianluca Stringhini.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Metadata are associated to most of the information we produce in our daily interactions and communication in the digital world. Yet, surprisingly, metadata are often still categorized as non-sensitive. Indeed, in the past, researchers and practitioners have mainly focused on the problem of the identification of a user from the content of a message.

<p>In this paper, we use Twitter as a case study to quantify the uniqueness of the association between metadata and user identity and to understand the effectiveness of potential obfuscation strategies. More specifically, we analyze atomic fields in the metadata and systematically combine them in an effort to classify new tweets as belonging to an account using different machine learning algorithms of increasing complexity. We demonstrate that through the application of a supervised learning algorithm, we are able to identify any user in a group of 10,000 with approximately 96.7% accuracy. Moreover, if we broaden the scope of our search and consider the 10 most likely candidates we increase the accuracy of the model to 99.22%. We also found that data obfuscation is hard and ineffective for this type of data: even after perturbing 60% of the training data, it is still possible to classify users with an accuracy higher than 95%. These results have strong implications in terms of the design of metadata obfuscation strategies, for example for data set release, not only for Twitter, but, more generally, for most social media platforms.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/facebook-and-google-manipulate-users-into-sharing-personal-data/">just published</a> an <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-06-27-deceived-by-design-final.pdf">excellent report</a> on the deceptive practices tech companies use to trick people into giving up their privacy.</p>

<p>From the executive summary:</p>

<blockquote><p>Facebook and Google have privacy intrusive defaults, where users who want the privacy friendly option have to go through a significantly longer process. They even obscure some of these settings so that the user cannot know that the more privacy intrusive option was preselected.

<p>The popups from Facebook, Google and Windows 10 have design, symbols and wording that nudge users away from the privacy friendly choices. Choices are worded to compel users to make certain choices, while key information is omitted or downplayed. None of them lets the user freely postpone decisions.  Also, Facebook and Google threaten users with loss of functionality or deletion of the user account if the user does not choose the privacy intrusive option.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The combination of privacy intrusive defaults and the use of dark patterns, nudge users of Facebook and Google, and to a lesser degree Windows 10, toward the least privacy friendly options to a degree that we consider unethical. We question whether this is in accordance with the principles of data protection by default and data protection by design, and if consent given under these circumstances can be said to be explicit, informed and freely given.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am a big fan of the Norwegian Consumer Council. They've published some <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/siste-nytt/connected-toys-violate-consumer-laws/">excellent</a> <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/significant-security-flaws-in-smartwatches-for-children/">research</a>.</p>

	    <p>Princeton's Karen Levy has a <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/apps-cant-stop-exes-who-use-technology-for-stalking.html">good article</a> computer security and the intimate partner threat:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you learn that your privacy has been compromised, the common advice is to prevent additional access -- delete your insecure account, open a new one, change your password. This advice is such standard protocol for personal security that it's almost a no-brainer. But in abusive romantic relationships, disconnection can be <i>extremely</i> fraught. For one, it can put the victim at risk of physical harm: If abusers expect digital access and that access is suddenly closed off, it can lead them to become more violent or intrusive in other ways. It may seem cathartic to delete abusive material, like alarming text messages -- but if you don't preserve that kind of evidence, it can make prosecution more difficult. And closing some kinds of accounts, like social networks, to hide from a determined abuser can cut off social support that survivors desperately need. In some cases, maintaining a digital connection to the abuser may even be legally required (for instance, if the abuser and survivor share joint custody of children).

<p>Threats from intimate partners also change the nature of what it means to be authenticated online. In most contexts, access credentialsÂ­ -- like passwords and security questions -- are intended to insulate your accounts against access from an adversary. But those mechanisms are often completely ineffective for security in intimate contexts: The abuser can compel disclosure of your password through threats of violence and has access to your devices because you're in the same physical space. In many cases, the abuser might even own your phone -- or might have access to your communications data because you share a family plan. Things like security questions are unlikely to be effective tools for protecting your security, because the abuser knows or can guess at intimate details about your life -- where you were born, what your first job was, the name of your pet.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>It's not a great solution, but it's  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-facebook/facebook-plans-to-use-u-s-mail-to-verify-ids-of-election-ad-buyers-idUSKCN1G10VD">something</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The process of using postcards containing a specific code will be required for advertising that mentions a specific candidate running for a federal office, Katie Harbath, Facebook's global director of policy programs, said. The requirement will not apply to issue-based political ads, she said.

<p>"If you run an ad mentioning a candidate, we are going to mail you a postcard and you will have to use that code to prove you are in the United States," Harbath said at a weekend conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State, where executives from Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google also spoke.</p>

<p>"It won't solve everything," Harbath said in a brief interview with Reuters following her remarks.</p>

<p>But sending codes through old-fashioned mail was the most effective method the tech company could come up with to prevent Russians and other bad actors from purchasing ads while posing as someone else, Harbath said.</p></blockquote>

<p>It does mean a several-days delay between purchasing an ad and seeing it run.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adolfoflores/people-are-worried-about-dhs-plans-to-gather-social-media">New rules</a> give the DHS permission to collect "social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results" as part of people's immigration files. The Federal Register has the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/18/2017-19365/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records">details</a>, which seems to also include US citizens that communicate with immigrants.</p>

<p>This is part of the general trend to scrutinize people coming into the US more, but it's hard to get too worked up about the DHS accessing publicly available information. More disturbing is the trend of occasionally asking for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/02/give-us-your-passwords/516315/">social media passwords</a> at the border.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@chrisbuetti/how-i-eat-for-free-in-nyc-using-python-automation-artificial-intelligence-and-instagram-a5ed8a1e2a10">This</a> is a fascinating hack:</p>

<blockquote><p>In today's digital age, a large Instagram audience is considered a valuable currency. I had also heard through the grapevine that I could monetize a large following -- or in my desired case -- use it to have my meals paid for. <i>So I did just that</i>.

<p>I created an Instagram page that showcased pictures of New York City's skylines, iconic spots, elegant skyscrapers Â­-- you name it. The page has amassed a following of over 25,000 users in the NYC area and it's still rapidly growing.</p>

<p>I reach out restaurants in the area either via Instagram's direct messaging or email and offer to post a positive review in return for a free entree or at least a discount. Almost every restaurant I've messaged came back at me with a compensated meal or a gift card. Most places have an allocated marketing budget for these types of things so they were happy to offer me a free dining experience in exchange for a promotion. I've ended up giving some of these meals away to my friends and family because at times I had too many queued up to use myself.</p>

<p>The beauty of this all is that <b>I automated the whole thing</b>. And I mean 100% of it. I wrote code that finds these pictures or videos, makes a caption, adds hashtags, credits where the picture or video comes from, weeds out bad or spammy posts, posts them, follows and unfollows users, likes pictures, monitors my inbox, and most importantly -- both direct messages and emails restaurants about a potential promotion. Since its inception, I haven't even really logged into the account. I spend zero time on it. It's essentially a robot that operates like a human, but the average viewer can't tell the difference. And as the programmer, I get to sit back and admire its (and my) work.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much going on in this project.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011963"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/attacking_soldi.html">Attacking Soldiers on Social Media</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>A research group at NATO's Strategic Communications Center of Excellence catfished soldiers involved in an European military exercise -- we don't know what country they were from -- to demonstrate the power of the attack technique.</p>

<blockquote><p>Over four weeks, the researchers developed fake pages and closed groups on Facebook that looked like they were associated with the military exercise, as well as profiles impersonating service members both real and imagined.

<p>To recruit soldiers to the pages, they used targeted Facebook advertising. Those pages then promoted the closed groups the researchers had created. Inside the groups, the researchers used their phony accounts to ask the real service members questions about their battalions and their work. They also used these accounts to "friend" service members. According to the report, Facebook's Suggested Friends feature proved helpful in surfacing additional targets.</p>

<p>The researchers also tracked down service members' Instagram and Twitter accounts and searched for other information available online, some of which a bad actor might be able to exploit. "We managed to find quite a lot of data on individual people, which would include sensitive information," Biteniece says. "Like a serviceman having a wife and also being on dating apps."</p>

<p>By the end of the exercise, the researchers identified 150 soldiers, found the locations of several battalions, tracked troop movements, and compelled service members to engage in "undesirable behavior," including leaving their positions against orders.</p>

<p>"Every person has a button. For somebody there's a financial issue, for somebody it's a very appealing date, for somebody it's a family thing," Sarts says. "It's varied, but everybody has a button. The point is, what's openly available online is sufficient to know what that is."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the future of warfare. It's one of the reasons China stole all of that data from the Office of Personal Management. If indeed a country's intelligence service <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/equifax-mystery-where-is-the-data.html">was behind</a> the Equifax attack, this is why they did it.</p>

<p>Go back and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/08/future_cyberwar.html">read this scenario</a> from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Why wouldn't a country intent on starting a war do it that way?</p>

<p>Cory Doctorow <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/11/26/candy-from-strangers.html">points out</a> that this is a clever new attack vector:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many open source projects attain a level of "maturity" where no one really needs any new features and there aren't a lot of new bugs being found, and the contributors to these projects dwindle, often to a single maintainer who is generally grateful for developers who take an interest in these older projects and offer to share the choresome, intermittent work of keeping the projects alive. 

<p>Ironically, these are often projects with millions of users, who trust them specifically because of their stolid, unexciting maturity. </p>

<p>This presents a scary social-engineering vector for malware: A malicious person volunteers to help maintain the project, makes some small, positive contributions, gets commit access to the project, and releases a malicious patch, infecting millions of users and apps.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Brian Krebs is <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/voice-phishing-scams-are-getting-more-clever/">reporting</a> on some new and sophisticated phishing scams over the telephone.</p>

<p>I second his advice: "never give out any information about yourself in response to an unsolicited phone call." Always call them back, and not using the number offered to you by the caller. Always.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD: In 2009, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2009/03/the_kindness_of_stra.html">wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I was growing up, children were commonly taught: "don't talk to strangers." Strangers might be bad, we were told, so it's prudent to steer clear of them.

<p>And yet most people are honest, kind, and generous, especially when someone asks them for help. If a small child is in trouble, the smartest thing he can do is find a nice-looking stranger and talk to him.</p>

<p>These two pieces of advice may seem to contradict each other, but they don't. The difference is that in the second instance, the child is choosing which stranger to talk to. Given that the overwhelming majority of people will help, the child is likely to get help if he chooses a random stranger. But if a stranger comes up to a child and talks to him or her, it's not a random choice. It's more likely, although still unlikely, that the stranger is up to no good.</p></blockquote>

<p>That advice is generalizable to this instance as well. The problem is that someone claiming to be from your bank asking for personal information. The problem is that they contacted you first.</p>

<p>Where else does this advice hold true?</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011329"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/10/impersonating_i.html">Impersonating iOS Password Prompts</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>This is an interesting security vulnerability: because it is <a href="https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-stealpassword-easily-get-the-users-apple-id-password-just-by-asking">so easy to impersonate</a> iOS password prompts, a malicious app can steal your password just by asking.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why does this work?

<p>iOS asks the user for their iTunes password for many reasons, the most common ones are recently installed iOS operating system updates, or iOS apps that are stuck during installation.</p>

<p>As a result, users are trained to just enter their Apple ID password whenever iOS prompts you to do so. However, those popups are not only shown on the lock screen, and the home screen, but also inside random apps, e.g. when they want to access iCloud, GameCenter or In-App-Purchases.</p>

<p>This could easily be abused by any app, just by showing an UIAlertController, that looks exactly like the system dialog.</p>

<p>Even users who know a lot about technology have a hard time detecting that those alerts are phishing attacks.</p></blockquote>

<p>The essay proposes some solutions, but I'm not sure they'll work. We're all trained to trust our computers and the applications running on them.</p>

	    <p><a href="http://www.standard.net.au/story/4644792/police-warn-of-phone-voice-scam/?cs=72">This article</a> feels like hyperbole:</p>

<blockquote><p>The scam has arrived in Australia after being used in the United States and Britain.

<p>The scammer may ask several times "can you hear me?", to which people would usually reply "yes."</p>

<p>The scammer is then believed to record the "yes" response and end the call.</p>

<p>That recording of the victim's voice can then be used to authorise payments or charges in the victim's name through voice recognition.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are there really banking systems that use voice recognition of the word "yes" to authenticate? I have never heard of that.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://lyrebird.ai">LyreBird</a> is a system that can accurately reproduce the voice of someone, given a large amount of sample inputs. It's pretty good -- listen to the demo <a href="https://lyrebird.ai/demo">here</a> -- and will only get better over time.</p>

<p>The applications for recorded-voice forgeries are obvious, but I think the larger security risk will be real-time forgery. Imagine the social engineering implications of an attacker on the telephone being able to impersonate someone the victim knows.</p>

<p>I don't think we're ready for this. We use people's voices to authenticate them all the time, in all sorts of different ways.</p>

But the imaginings are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/technology/artificial-intelligence-evolves-with-its-criminal-potential.html">becoming mainstream</a> -- and the future isn't too far off.</p>

<p>Along similar lines, computers are able to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/10/23/artifically-intelligent-judge-developed-which-can-predict-court/">predict court verdicts</a>. My guess is that the real use here isn't to predict actual court verdicts, but for well-paid defense teams to test various defensive tactics. </p>

	    <p>Yet another <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/leaked-catalog-weaponized-information-twitter-aglaya">leaked catalog</a> of Internet attack services, this one specializing in disinformation:</p>

<blockquote><p>But Aglaya had much more to offer, according to its brochure. For eight to 12 weeks campaigns costing â¬2,500 per day, the company promised to "pollute" internet search results and social networks like Facebook and Twitter "to manipulate current events." For this service, which it labelled "Weaponized Information," Aglaya offered "infiltration," "ruse," and "sting" operations to "discredit a target" such as an "individual or company."

<p>"[We] will continue to barrage information till it gains 'traction' & top 10 search results yield a desired results on ANY Search engine," the company boasted as an extra "benefit" of this service.</p>

<p>Aglaya also offered censorship-as-a-service, or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, for only â¬600 a day, using botnets to "send dummy traffic" to targets, taking them offline, according to the brochure. As part of this service, customers could buy an add-on to "create false criminal charges against Targets in their respective countries" for a more costly â¬1 million.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Some of Aglaya's offerings, according to experts who reviewed the document for Motherboard, are likely to be exaggerated or completely made-up. But the document shows that there are governments interested in these services, which means there will be companies willing to fill the gaps in the market and offer them.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Turns out that the software a bunch of CAs used to generate public-key certificates <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-google-godaddy-misissued-tls-certificates-with-weak-serial-numbers/">was</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/godaddy-apple-and-google-goof-results-in-1-million-misissued-certificates/">flawed</a>: they created random serial numbers with only 63 bits instead of the required 64. That may not seem like a big deal to the layman, but that one bit change means that the serial numbers only have half the required entropy. This really isn't a security problem; the serial numbers are to protect against attacks that involve weak hash functions, and we don't allow those weak hash functions anymore. Still, it's a good thing that the CAs are reissuing the certificates. The point of a standard is that it's to be followed.<br />

	    <p>Nice <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/59v8dk/hackers-fake-hand-vein-authentication-biometrics-chaos-communication-congress">work</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One attraction of a vein based system over, say, a more traditional fingerprint system is that it may be typically harder for an attacker to learn how a user's veins are positioned under their skin, rather than lifting a fingerprint from a held object or high quality photograph, for example.

<p>But with that said, Krissler and Albrecht first took photos of their vein patterns. They used a converted SLR camera with the infrared filter removed; this allowed them to see the pattern of the veins under the skin.</p>

<p>"It's enough to take photos from a distance of five meters, and it might work to go to a press conference and take photos of them," Krissler explained. In all, the pair took over 2,500 pictures to over 30 days to perfect the process and find an image that worked.</p>

<p>They then used that image to make a wax model of their hands which included the vein detail.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Attackers are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/12/iranian-phishers-bypass-2fa-protections-offered-by-yahoo-mail-and-gmail/">targeting</a> two-factor authentication systems:</p>

<blockquote><p>Attackers working on behalf of the Iranian government collected detailed information on targets and used that knowledge to write spear-phishing emails that were tailored to the targets' level of operational security, researchers with security firm Certfa Lab said in a <a href="https://blog.certfa.com/posts/the-return-of-the-charming-kitten/">blog post</a>. The emails contained a hidden image that alerted the attackers in real time when targets viewed the messages. When targets entered passwords into a fake Gmail or Yahoo security page, the attackers would almost simultaneously enter the credentials into a real login page. In the event targets' accounts were protected by 2fa, the attackers redirected targets to a new page that requested a one-time password.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Researchers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepmasterprints-fake-fingerprints-machine-learning/">are</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/15/fake-fingerprints-can-imitate-real-fingerprints-in-biometric-systems-research">able</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ai-can-now-fake-fingerprints-that-fool-biometric-id-sca-1830464777">to</a> <a href="https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/11/15/researchers-create-master-key-fingerprints-that-can-fool-biometric-databases/">create</a> fake fingerprints that result in a 20% false-positive rate.</p>

<blockquote><p>The problem is that these sensors obtain only partial images of users' fingerprints -- at the points where they make contact with the scanner. The paper noted that since partial prints are not as distinctive as complete prints, the chances of one partial print getting matched with another is high.

<p>The artificially generated prints, dubbed DeepMasterPrints by the researchers, capitalize on the aforementioned vulnerability to accurately imitate one in five fingerprints in a database. The database was originally supposed to have only an error rate of one in a thousand.</p>

<p>Another vulnerability exploited by the researchers was the high prevalence of some natural fingerprint features such as <a href="http://www.touchngoid.com/8-common-fingerprint-patterns/">loops and whorls</a>, compared to others. With this understanding, the team generated some prints that contain several of these common features. They found that these artificial prints were more likely to match with other prints than would be normally possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>If this result is robust -- and I assume it will be improved upon over the coming years -- it will make the current generation of fingerprint readers obsolete as secure biometrics. It also opens a new chapter in the arms race between biometric authentication systems and fake biometrics that can fool them.</p>

<p>More interestingly, I wonder if similar techniques can be brought to bear against other biometrics are well.</p>

	    <p>Troy Hunt has a <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-insert-thing-here-is-not-a-password-killer/">good essay</a> about why passwords are here to stay, despite all their security problems:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is why passwords aren't going anywhere in the foreseeable future and why [insert thing here] isn't going to kill them. No amount of focusing on how bad passwords are or how many accounts have been breached or what it costs when people can't access their accounts is going to change that. Nor will the technical prowess of [insert thing here] change the discussion because it simply can't compete with passwords on that one metric organisations are so focused on: usability. Sure, there'll be edge cases and certainly there remain scenarios where higher-friction can be justified due to either the nature of the asset being protected or the demographic of the audience, but you're not about to see your everyday e-commerce, social media or even banking sites changing en mass.</p></blockquote>

<p>He rightly points out that biometric authentication systems -- like Apple's Face ID and fingerprint authentication -- augment passwords rather than replace them. And I want to add that good two-factor systems, like Duo, also augment passwords rather than replace them.</p>

	    <p>From <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-co-1828476051">Kashmir Hill</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Facebook is not content to use the contact information you willingly put into your Facebook profile for advertising. It is also using contact information you handed over for security purposes and contact information you didn't hand over at all, but that was collected from other people's contact books, a hidden layer of details Facebook has about you that I've come to call "shadow contact information." I managed to place an ad in front of Alan Mislove by targeting his shadow profile. This means that the junk email address that you hand over for discounts or for shady online shopping is likely associated with your account and being used to target you with ads.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here's the research <a href="https://mislove.org/publications/PII-PETS.pdf">paper</a>. Hill again:</p>

<blockquote><p>They found that when a user gives Facebook a phone number for two-factor authentication or in order to receive alerts about new log-ins to a user's account, that phone number became targetable by an advertiser within a couple of weeks. So users who want their accounts to be more secure are forced to make a privacy trade-off and allow advertisers to more easily find them on the social network.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We report the first active acoustic side-channel attack. Speakers are used to emit human inaudible acoustic signals and the echo is recorded via microphones, turning the acoustic system of a smart phone into a sonar system. The echo signal can be used to profile user interaction with the device. For example, a victim's finger movements can be inferred to steal Android phone unlock patterns. In our empirical study, the number of candidate unlock patterns that an attacker must try to authenticate herself to a Samsung S4 Android phone can be reduced by up to 70% using this novel acoustic side-channel. Our approach can be easily applied to other application scenarios and device types. Overall, our work highlights a new family of security threats.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The UK's GCHQ delivers a brutally blunt <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/quantum-key-distribution">assessment</a> of quantum key distribution:</p>

<blockquote><p>QKD protocols address only the problem of agreeing keys for encrypting data. Ubiquitous on-demand modern services (such as verifying identities and data integrity, establishing network sessions, providing access control, and automatic software updates) rely more on authentication and integrity mechanisms -- such as digital signatures -- than on encryption.

<p>QKD technology cannot replace the flexible authentication mechanisms provided by contemporary public key signatures. QKD also seems unsuitable for some of the grand future challenges such as securing the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, social media, or cloud applications.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with them. It's a clever idea, but basically useless in practice. I don't even think it's anything more than a niche solution in a world where quantum computers have broken our traditional public-key algorithms.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011614"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/06/perverse_vulner.html">Perverse Vulnerability from Interaction between 2-Factor Authentication and iOS AutoFill</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Apple is rolling out an iOS security usability feature called Security code AutoFill. The basic idea is that the OS scans incoming SMS messages for security codes and suggests them in AutoFill, so that people can use them without having to memorize or type them.</p>

<p>Sounds like a really good idea, but Andreas Gutmann <a href="https://www.benthamsgaze.org/2018/06/08/security-code-autofill-is-this-new-ios-feature-a-security-risk-for-online-banking/">points out</a> an application where this could become a vulnerability: when authenticating transactions:</p>

<blockquote><p>Transaction authentication, as opposed to user authentication, is used to attest the correctness of the intention of an action rather than just the identity of a user. It is most widely known from online banking, where it is an essential tool to defend against sophisticated attacks. For example, an adversary can try to trick a victim into transferring money to a different account than the one intended. To achieve this the adversary might use social engineering techniques such as <a href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/phishing">phishing and vishing</a> and/or tools such as <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Man-in-the-browser_attack">Man-in-the-Browser malware</a>.

<p>Transaction authentication is used to defend against these adversaries. Different methods exist but in the one of relevance here -- which is among the most common methods currently used -- the bank will summarise the salient information of any transaction request, augment this summary with a TAN tailored to that information, and send this data to the registered phone number via SMS. The user, or bank customer in this case, should verify the summary and, if this summary matches with his or her intentions, copy the TAN from the SMS message into the webpage.</p>

<p>This new iOS feature creates problems for the use of SMS in transaction authentication. Applied to 2FA, the user would no longer need to open and read the SMS from which the code has already been conveniently extracted and presented. Unless this feature can reliably distinguish between OTPs in 2FA and TANs in transaction authentication, we can expect that users will also have their TANs extracted and presented without context of the salient information, e.g. amount and destination of the transaction. Yet, precisely the verification of this salient information is essential for security. Examples of where this scenario could apply include a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the user accessing online banking from their mobile browser, or where a malicious website or app on the user's phone accesses the bank's legitimate online banking service. </p></blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting interaction between two security systems. Security code AutoFill eliminates the need for the user to view the SMS or memorize the one-time code. Transaction authentication assumes the user read and approved the additional information in the SMS message before using the one-time code.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011969"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/cybersecurity_f_1.html">Cybersecurity for the Public Interest</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The Crypto Wars have been waging off-and-on for a quarter-century. On one side is law enforcement, which wants to be able to break encryption, to access devices and communications of terrorists and criminals. On the other are almost every cryptographer and computer security expert, repeatedly explaining that there's no way to provide this capability without also weakening the security of every user of those devices and communications systems.</p>

<p>It's an impassioned debate, acrimonious at times, but there are real technologies that can be brought to bear on the problem: key-escrow technologies, code obfuscation technologies, and backdoors with different properties. Pervasive surveillance capitalism -- Â­as practiced by the Internet companies that are already spying on everyoneÂ­ -- matters. So does society's underlying security needs. There is a security benefit to giving access to law enforcement, even though it would inevitably and invariably also give that access to others. However, there is also a security benefit of having these systems protected from all attackers, including law enforcement. These benefits are mutually exclusive. Which is more important, and to what degree?</p>

<p>The problem is that almost no policymakers are discussing this policy issue from a technologically informed perspective, and very few technologists truly understand the policy contours of the debate. The result is both sides consistently talking past each other, and policy proposals -- Â­that occasionally become lawÂ­ -- that are technological disasters.</p>

<p>This isn't sustainable, either for this issue or any of the other policy issues surrounding Internet security. We need policymakers who understand technology, but we also need cybersecurity technologists who understandÂ­ -- and are involved in -- Â­policy. We need public-interest technologists.</p>

<p>Let's pause at that term. The Ford Foundation defines public-interest technologists as "technology practitioners who focus on social justice, the common good, and/or the public interest." A group of academics recently wrote that public-interest technologists are people who "study the application of technology expertise to advance the public interest, generate public benefits, or promote the public good." Tim Berners-Lee has called them "philosophical engineers." I think of public-interest technologists as people who combine their technological expertise with a public-interest focus: by working on tech policy, by working on a tech project with a public benefit, or by working as a traditional technologist for an organization with a public benefit. Maybe it's not the best termÂ­ -- and I know not everyone likes itÂ­ -- but it's a decent umbrella term that can encompass all these roles.</p>

<p>We need public-interest technologists in policy discussions. We need them on congressional staff, in federal agencies, at non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in academia, inside companies, and as part of the press. In our field, we need them to get involved in not only the Crypto Wars, but everywhere cybersecurity and policy touch each other: the vulnerability equities debate, election security, cryptocurrency policy, Internet of Things safety and security, big data, algorithmic fairness, adversarial machine learning, critical infrastructure, and national security. When you broaden the definition of Internet security, many additional areas fall within the intersection of cybersecurity and policy. Our particular expertise and way of looking at the world is critical for understanding a great many technological issues, such as net neutrality and the regulation of critical infrastructure. I wouldn't want to formulate public policy about artificial intelligence and robotics without a security technologist involved.</p>

<p>Public-interest technology isn't new. Many organizations are working in this area, from older organizations like EFF and EPIC to newer ones like Verified Voting and Access Now. Many academic classes and programs combine technology and public policy. My cybersecurity policy class at the Harvard Kennedy School is just one example. Media startups like The Markup are doing technology-driven journalism. There are even programs and initiatives related to public-interest technology inside for-profit corporations.</p>

<p>This might all seem like a lot, but it's really not. There aren't enough people doing it, there aren't enough people who know it needs to be done, and there aren't enough places to do it. We need to build a world where there is a viable career path for public-interest technologists.</p>

<p>There are many barriers. There's a report titled A Pivotal Moment that includes this quote: "While we cite individual instances of visionary leadership and successful deployment of technology skill for the public interest, there was a consensus that a stubborn cycle of inadequate supply, misarticulated demand, and an inefficient marketplace stymie progress."</p>

<p>That quote speaks to the three places for intervention. One: the supply side. There just isn't enough talent to meet the eventual demand. This is especially acute in cybersecurity, which has a talent problem across the field. Public-interest technologists are a diverse and multidisciplinary group of people. Their backgrounds come from technology, policy, and law. We also need to foster diversity within public-interest technology; the populations using the technology must be represented in the groups that shape the technology. We need a variety of ways for people to engage in this sphere: ways people can do it on the side, for a couple of years between more traditional technology jobs, or as a full-time rewarding career. We need public-interest technology to be part of every core computer-science curriculum, with "clinics" at universities where students can get a taste of public-interest work. We need technology companies to give people sabbaticals to do this work, and then value what they've learned and done.</p>

<p>Two: the demand side. This is our biggest problem right now; not enough organizations understand that they need technologists doing public-interest work. We need jobs to be funded across a wide variety of NGOs. We need staff positions throughout the government: executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. President Obama's US Digital Service should be expanded and replicated; so should Code for America. We need more press organizations that perform this kind of work.</p>

<p>Three: the marketplace. We need job boards, conferences, and skills exchangesÂ­ -- places where people on the supply side can learn about the demand.</p>

<p>Major foundations are starting to provide funding in this space: the Ford and MacArthur Foundations in particular, but others as well.</p>

<p>This problem in our field has an interesting parallel with the field of public-interest law. In the 1960s, there was no such thing as public-interest law. The field was deliberately created, funded by organizations like the Ford Foundation. They financed legal aid clinics at universities, so students could learn housing, discrimination, or immigration law. They funded fellowships at organizations like the ACLU and the NAACP. They created a world where public-interest law is valued, where all the partners at major law firms are expected to have done some public-interest work. Today, when the ACLU advertises for a staff attorney, paying one-third to one-tenth normal salary, it gets hundreds of applicants. Today, 20% of Harvard Law School graduates go into public-interest law, and the school has soul-searching seminars because that percentage is so low. Meanwhile, the percentage of computer-science graduates going into public-interest work is basically zero.</p>

<p>This is bigger than computer security. Technology now permeates society in a way it didn't just a couple of decades ago, and governments move too slowly to take this into account. That means technologists now are relevant to all sorts of areas that they had no traditional connection to: climate change, food safety, future of work, public health, bioengineering.</p>

<p>More generally, technologists need to understand the policy ramifications of their work. There's a pervasive myth in Silicon Valley that technology is politically neutral. It's not, and I hope most people reading this today knows that. We built a world where programmers felt they had an inherent right to code the world as they saw fit. We were allowed to do this because, until recently, it didn't matter. Now, too many issues are being decided in an unregulated capitalist environment where significant social costs are too often not taken into account.</p>

<p>This is where the core issues of society lie. The defining political question of the 20th century was: "What should be governed by the state, and what should be governed by the market?" This defined the difference between East and West, and the difference between political parties within countries. The defining political question of the first half of the 21st century is: "How much of our lives should be governed by technology, and under what terms?" In the last century, economists drove public policy. In this century, it will be technologists.</p>

<p>The future is coming faster than our current set of policy tools can deal with. The only way to fix this is to develop a new set of policy tools with the help of technologists. We need to be in all aspects of public-interest work, from informing policy to creating tools all building the future. The world needs all of our help.</p>

	    <p>Notice this bit from an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/ex-coast-guard-lieutenant-ordered-held-for-14-days-while-government-weighs-terrorism-related-charges-in-his-planning-of-widespread-terrorist-attack/2019/02/21/57918f12-3573-11e9-854a-7a14d7fec96a_story.html?utm_term=.1c07672f6f6b">article</a> on the arrest of Christopher Hasson:</p>

<blockquote><p>It was only after Hasson's arrest last Friday at his workplace that the chilling plans prosecutors assert he was crafting became apparent, detected by an internal Coast Guard program that watches for any "insider threat."

<p>The program identified suspicious computer activity tied to Hasson, prompting the agency's investigative service to launch an investigation last fall, said Lt. Cmdr. Scott McBride, a service spokesman.</p></blockquote>

<p>Any detection system of this kind is going to have to balance false positives with false negatives. Could it be something as simple as visiting right-wing extremist websites or watching their videos? It just has to be something more sophisticated than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/new-york-police-terrorism-pressure-cooker">researching pressure cookers</a>. I'm glad that Hasson was arrested before he killed anyone rather than after, but I worry that these systems are basically creating <a href="https://www.planetebook.com/free-ebooks/1984.pdf">thoughtcrime</a>.</p>

	    <p>The police are increasingly <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/reverse-location-search-warrants-google-police.html">getting search warrants</a> for information about all cell phones in a certain location at a certain time:</p>

<blockquote><p>Police departments across the country have been knocking at Google's door for at least the last two years with warrants to tap into the company's extensive stores of cellphone location data. Known as "reverse location search warrants," these legal mandates allow law enforcement to sweep up the coordinates and movements of every cellphone in a broad area. The police can then check to see if any of the phones came close to the crime scene. In doing so, however, the police can end up not only fishing for a suspect, but also gathering the location data of potentially hundreds (or thousands) of innocent people. There have only been anecdotal reports of reverse location searches, so it's unclear how widespread the practice is, but privacy advocates worry that Google's data will eventually allow more and more departments to conduct indiscriminate searches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it's not just Google who can provide this information.</p>

<p>I am also reminded of a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csec-used-airport-wi-fi-to-track-canadian-travellers-edward-snowden-documents-1.2517881">Canadian</a> <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news2/pdf/airports_redacted.pdf">surveillance program</a> disclosed by Snowden.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time talking about this sort of thing in <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/data_and_goliath/"><i>Data and Goliath</i></a>. Once you have everyone under surveillance all the time, many things are possible.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011924"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/01/evaluating_the_.html">Evaluating the GCHQ Exceptional Access Proposal</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The so-called Crypto Wars have been going on <a href="https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3407-doomed-to-repeat-history-lessons-from-the-crypto-wars-of-the-1990s/Crypto%20Wars_ReDo.7cb491837ac541709797bdf868d37f52.pdf">for 25 years</a> now. Basically, the FBI -- and some of their peer agencies in the UK, Australia, and elsewhere -- <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">argue</a> that the pervasive use of civilian encryption is hampering their ability to solve crimes and that they need the tech companies to make their systems susceptible to government eavesdropping. Sometimes their complaint is about communications systems, like voice or messaging apps. Sometimes it's about end-user devices. On the other side of this debate is pretty much all technologists working in computer security and cryptography, who <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">argue</a> that adding eavesdropping features fundamentally makes those systems less secure.</p>

<p>A recent entry in this debate is a <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">proposal</a> by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson, both from the UK's GCHQ (the British signals-intelligence agency -- basically, its NSA). It's actually a positive contribution to the discourse around backdoors; most of the time government officials broadly demand that the tech companies <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rod-rosenstein-encryption-backdoor/">figure out a way</a> to meet their requirements, without providing any details. Levy and Robinson write:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a world of encrypted services, a potential solution could be to go back a few decades. It's relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call. The service provider usually controls the identity system and so really decides who's who and which devices are involved -- they're usually involved in introducing the parties to a chat or call. You end up with everything still being end-to-end encrypted, but there's an extra 'end' on this particular communication. This sort of solution seems to be no more intrusive than the virtual crocodile clips that our democratically elected representatives and judiciary authorise today in traditional voice intercept solutions and certainly doesn't give any government power they shouldn't have.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the surface, this isn't a big ask. It doesn't affect the encryption that protects the communications. It only affects the authentication that assures people of whom they are talking to. But it's no less dangerous a backdoor than any others that have been proposed: It exploits a security vulnerability rather than fixing it, and it opens all users of the system to exploitation of that same vulnerability by others.</p>

<p>In a blog post, cryptographer Matthew Green <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">summarized</a> the technical problems with this GCHQ proposal. Basically, making this backdoor work requires not only changing the cloud computers that oversee communications, but it also means changing the client program on everyone's phone and computer. And that change makes all of those systems less secure. Levy and Robinson make a big deal of the fact that their backdoor would only be targeted against specific individuals and their communications, but it's still a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/62114/give-ghost-backdoor/">general backdoor</a> that <em>could</em> be used against anybody.</p>

<p>The basic problem is that a backdoor is a technical capability -- a vulnerability -- that is available to anyone who knows about it and has access to it. Surrounding that vulnerability is a procedural system that tries to limit access to that capability. Computers, especially internet-connected computers, are inherently hackable, limiting the effectiveness of any procedures. The best defense is to not have the vulnerability at all.</p>

<p>That old physical eavesdropping system Levy and Robinson allude to also exploits a security vulnerability. Because telephone conversations were unencrypted as they passed through the physical wires of the phone system, the police were able to go to a switch in a phone company facility or a junction box on the street and manually attach alligator clips to a specific pair and listen in to what that phone transmitted and received. It was a vulnerability that anyone could exploit -- not just the police -- but was mitigated by the fact that the phone company was a monolithic monopoly, and physical access to the wires was either difficult (inside a phone company building) or obvious (on the street at a junction box).</p>

<p>The functional equivalent of physical eavesdropping for modern computer phone switches is a requirement of a 1994 U.S. law called CALEA -- and similar laws in other countries. By law, telephone companies must engineer phone switches that the government can eavesdrop, mirroring that old physical system with computers. It is not the same thing, though. It doesn't have those same physical limitations that make it more secure. It can be administered remotely. And it's implemented by a computer, which makes it vulnerable to the same hacking that every other computer is vulnerable to.</p>

<p>This isn't a theoretical problem; these systems have been subverted. The most <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair">public incident</a> dates from 2004 in Greece. Vodafone Greece had phone switches with the eavesdropping feature mandated by CALEA. It was turned off by default in the Greek phone system, but the NSA managed to surreptitiously <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/">turn it on</a> and use it to eavesdrop on the Greek prime minister and over 100 other high-ranking dignitaries.</p>

<p>There's nothing distinct about a phone switch that makes it any different from other modern encrypted voice or chat systems; any remotely administered backdoor system will be just as vulnerable. Imagine a chat program added this GCHQ backdoor. It would have to add a feature that added additional parties to a chat from somewhere in the system -- and not by the people at the endpoints. It would have to suppress any messages alerting users to another party being added to that chat. Since some chat programs, like iMessage and Signal, automatically send such messages, it would force those systems to lie to their users. Other systems would simply never implement the "tell me who is in this chat conversation" featureÂ­which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>And once that's in place, every government will try to hack it for its own purposesÂ­ -- just as the NSA hacked Vodafone Greece. Again, this is nothing new. In 2010, China successfully hacked the back-door mechanism Google <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/china-google-attack-part-widespread-spying-effort-28293/">put in place</a> to meet law-enforcement requests. In 2015, someone -- we don't know who -- <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232227-where-did-i-leave-my-keys/abstract">hacked an NSA backdoor</a> in a random-number generator used to create encryption keys, changing the parameters so they could also eavesdrop on the communications. There are certainly other stories that haven't been made public.</p>

<p>Simply adding the feature erodes public trust. If you were a dissident in a totalitarian country trying to communicate securely, would you want to use a voice or messaging system that is known to have this sort of backdoor? Who would you bet on, especially when the cost of losing the bet might be imprisonment or worse: the company that runs the system, or your country's government intelligence agency? If you were a senior government official, or the head of a large multinational corporation, or the security manager or a critical technician at a power plant, would you want to use this system?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Two years ago, there was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-design-feature-encrypted-messages">rumor</a> of a WhatsApp backdoor. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/flawed-reporting-about-whatsapp">details</a> are <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">complicated</a>, and calling it a backdoor or a vulnerability <a href="https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/">is</a> <a href="http://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687">largely</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5nq201/whatsapp_backdoor_allows_snooping_on_encrypted/dce86wa/?st=jpfg671x&amp;sh=482f0949">inaccurate</a> -- but the resultant confusion caused some people to abandon the encrypted messaging service.</p>

<p>Trust is fragile, and <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/pjcis-2018/">transparency</a> is essential to trust. And while Levy and Robinson state that "any exceptional access solution should not fundamentally change the trust relationship between a service provider and its users," this proposal does exactly that. Communications companies could no longer be honest about what their systems were doing, and we would have no reason to trust them if they tried.</p>

<p>In the end, all of these exceptional access mechanisms, whether they exploit existing vulnerabilities that should be closed or force vendors to open new ones, reduce the security of the underlying system. They reduce our reliance on security technologies we know how to do well -- cryptography -- to computer security technologies we are much less good at. Even worse, they replace technical security measures with organizational procedures. Whether it's a database of master keys that could decrypt an iPhone or a communications switch that orchestrates who is securely chatting with whom, it is vulnerable to attack. And it will be attacked.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion is a specific example of a broader discussion that we need to have, and it's about the attack/defense balance. Which should we prioritize? Should we design our systems to be open to attack, in which case they can be exploited by law enforcement -- and others? Or should we design our systems to be as secure as possible, which means they will be better protected from hackers, criminals, foreign governments and -- unavoidably -- law enforcement as well?</p>

<p>This discussion is larger than the FBI's ability to solve crimes or the NSA's ability to spy. We know that foreign intelligence services are targeting the communications of our elected officials, our power infrastructure, and our voting systems. Do we really want some foreign country penetrating our lawful-access backdoor in the same way the NSA penetrated Greece's?</p>

<p>I have long maintained that we need to adopt a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/AC_StrategyPapers_No8_Saving_Cyberspace_WEB.pdf">defense-dominant strategy</a>: We should prioritize our need for security over our need for surveillance. This is especially true in the new world of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">physically capable computers</a>. Yes, it will mean that law enforcement will have a harder time eavesdropping on communications and unlocking computing devices. But law enforcement has <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">other forensic techniques</a> to collect surveillance data in our highly networked world. We'd be much better off <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20160301/104573/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-LandauS-20160301.pdf">increasing law enforcement's technical ability</a> to investigate crimes in the <a href="https://cdt.org/blog/%E2%80%98going-dark%E2%80%99-versus-a-%E2%80%98golden-age-for-surveillance%E2%80%99/">modern digital world</a> than we would be to weaken security for everyone. The ability to surreptitiously add ghost users to a conversation is a vulnerability, and it's one that we would be better served by closing than exploiting.</p>

	    <p>Good <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/opinion/cellphones-security-spying.html">essay</a> on the inherent vulnerabilities in the cell phone standards and the market barriers to fixing them.</p>

<blockquote><p>So far, industry and policymakers have largely dragged their feet when it comes to blocking cell-site simulators and SS7 attacks. Senator Ron Wyden, one of the few lawmakers vocal about this issue, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/24/fbi-surveillance-devices-may-interfere-with-calls-us-senator-says/">sent a letter in August</a> encouraging the Department of Justice to "be forthright with federal courts about the disruptive nature of cell-site simulators." No response has ever been published.

<p>The lack of action could be because it is a big task -- there are hundreds of companies and international bodies involved in the cellular network. The other reason could be that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have a vested interest in exploiting these same vulnerabilities. But law enforcement has other effective tools that are unavailable to criminals and spies. For example, the police can work directly with phone companies, serving warrants and Title III wiretap orders. In the end, eliminating these vulnerabilities is just as valuable for law enforcement as it is for everyone else.</p>

<p>As it stands, there is no government agency that has the power, funding and mission to fix the problems. Large companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Google and Apple have not been public about their efforts, if any exist.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Interesting research paper: "<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-scaife.pdf">Fear the Reaper: Characterization and Fast Detection of Card Skimmers</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Payment card fraud results in billions of dollars in losses annually. Adversaries increasingly acquire card data using skimmers, which are attached to legitimate payment devices including point of sale terminals, gas pumps, and ATMs. Detecting such devices can be difficult, and while many experts offer advice in doing so, there exists no large-scale characterization of skimmer technology to support such defenses. In this paper, we perform the first such study based on skimmers recovered by the NYPD's Financial Crimes Task Force over a 16 month period. After systematizing these devices, we develop the Skim Reaper, a detector which takes advantage of the physical properties and constraints necessary for many skimmers to steal card data. Our analysis shows the Skim Reaper effectively detects 100% of devices supplied by the NYPD. In so doing, we provide the first robust and portable mechanism for detecting card skimmers.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Earlier this month, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/09/five-eyes_intel.html">wrote about</a> a statement by the Five Eyes countries about encryption and back doors. (Short summary: they like them.) One of the weird things about the statement is that it was clearly written from a law-enforcement perspective, though we normally think of the Five Eyes as a consortium of intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Susan Landau <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/five-eyes-statement-encryption-things-are-seldom-what-they-seem">examines </a> the details of the statement, explains what's going on, and why the statement is a lot less than what it might seem.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011737"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/09/security_risks_14.html">Security Risks of Government Hacking</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Some of us -- myself included -- have proposed lawful government hacking as an alternative to backdoors. A new report from the Center of Internet and Society looks at <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/publication/files/2018.09.04_Security_Risks_of_Government_Hacking_Whitepaper.pdf">the security risks</a> of allowing government hacking. They include:</p>

<ul><li>Disincentive for vulnerability disclosure
<li>Cultivation of a market for surveillance tools
<li>Attackers co-opt hacking tools over which governments have lost control
<li>Attackers learn of vulnerabilities through government use of malware
<li>Government incentives to push for less-secure software and standards
<li>Government malware affects innocent users.</ul>

<p>These risks are real, but I think they're much less than mandating backdoors for everyone. From the report's conclusion:</p>

<blockquote><p>Government hacking is often lauded as a solution to the "going dark" problem. It is too dangerous to mandate encryption backdoors, but targeted hacking of endpoints could ensure investigators access to same or similar necessary data with less risk. Vulnerabilities will never affect everyone, contingent as they are on software, network configuration, and patch management. Backdoors, however, mean everybody is vulnerable and a security failure fails catastrophically. In addition, backdoors are often secret, while eventually, vulnerabilities will typically be disclosed and patched.</p></blockquote>

<p>The key to minimizing the risks is to ensure that law enforcement (or whoever) report all vulnerabilities discovered through the normal process, and use them for lawful hacking during the period between reporting and patching. Yes, that's a big ask, but the alternatives are worse.</p>

<p><a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209&context=njtip">This</a> is the canonical lawful hacking paper. </p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011668"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/new_report_on_p.html">New Report on Police Digital Forensics Techniques</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>According to a new <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/low-hanging-fruit-evidence-based-solutions-digital-evidence-challenge">CSIS report</a>, "going dark" is not the most pressing problem facing law enforcement in the age of digital data:</p>

<blockquote><p>Over the past year, we conducted a series of interviews with federal, state, and local law enforcement officials, attorneys, service providers, and civil society groups. We also commissioned a survey of law enforcement officers from across the country to better understand the full range of difficulties they are facing in accessing and using digital evidence in their cases. Survey results indicate that accessing data from service providers -- much of which is not encrypted -- is the biggest problem that law enforcement currently faces in leveraging digital evidence.

<p>This is a problem that has not received adequate attention or resources to date. An array of federal and state training centers, crime labs, and other efforts have arisen to help fill the gaps, but they are able to fill only a fraction of the need. And there is no central entity responsible for monitoring these efforts, taking stock of the demand, and providing the assistance needed. The key federal entity with an explicit mission to assist state and local law enforcement with their digital evidence needsÂ­ -- the National Domestic Communications Assistance Center (NDCAC)Â­has a budget of $11.4 million, spread among several different programs designed to distribute knowledge about service providers' poliÂ­cies and products, develop and share technical tools, and train law enforcement on new services and techÂ­nologies, among other initiatives.</p></blockquote>

<p>From a <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2018/07/25/out-today-report-on-law-enforcements-fight-to-uncover-digital-evidence-296783">news article</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In addition to bemoaning the lack of guidance and help from tech companies -- a quarter of survey respondents said their top issue was convincing companies to hand over suspects' data -- law enforcement officials also reported receiving barely any digital evidence training. Local police said they'd received only 10 hours of training in the past 12 months; state police received 13 and federal officials received 16. A plurality of respondents said they only received annual training. Only 16 percent said their organizations scheduled training sessions at least twice per year.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a point that Susan Landau has <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Landau-Written-Testimony.pdf">repeatedly made</a>, and also one I make in my <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">new book</a>. The FBI needs technical expertise, not backdoors.</p>

	    <p>An <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2938033">article I co-wrote</a> -- my first law journal article -- was <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/03/06/12564.pdf">cited</a> by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court -- the state supreme court -- in a case on compelled decryption.</p>

<p>Here's the first, in footnote 1:</p>

<blockquote><p>We understand the word "password" to be synonymous with other terms that cell phone users may be familiar with, such as Personal Identification Number or "passcode." Each term refers to the personalized combination of letters or digits that, when manually entered by the user, "unlocks" a cell phone. For simplicity, we use "password" throughout. See generally, Kerr & Schneier, Encryption Workarounds, 106 Geo. L.J. 989, 990, 994, 998 (2018).</p></blockquote>

<p>And here's the second, in footnote 5:</p>

<blockquote><p>We recognize that ordinary cell phone users are likely unfamiliar with the complexities of encryption technology. For instance, although entering a password "unlocks" a cell phone, the password itself is not the "encryption key" that decrypts the cell phone's contents. See Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em> at 995. Rather, "entering the [password] decrypts the [encryption] key, enabling the key to be processed and unlocking the phone. This two-stage process is invisible to the casual user." <em>Id</em>. Because the technical details of encryption technology do not play a role in our analysis, they are not worth belaboring. Accordingly, we treat the entry of a password as effectively decrypting the contents of a cell phone. For a more detailed discussion of encryption technology, see generally Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em>.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Yesterday at the RSA Conference, I gave a <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/videos/the-role-of-security-technologists-in-public-policy">keynote talk</a> about the role of public-interest technologists in cybersecurity. (Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86w_XzlZ7GM">here</a>).</p>

<p>I also hosted a <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19/agenda/bridging-the-gap-cybersecurity-public-interest-tech">one-day mini-track</a> on the topic. We had six panels, and they were all great. If you missed it live, we have videos:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19/agenda/sessions/16899-Introduction-Public-Interest-Technologists-and-Cybersecurity">How Public Interest Technologists are Changing the World</a>: Matt Mitchell, Tactical Tech; Bruce Schneier, Fellow and Lecturer, Harvard Kennedy School; and J. Bob Alotta, Astraea Foundation (Moderator).  (Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpmgfpt_RU0">here</a>.)

<p><li><a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19/agenda/sessions/16900-Public-Interest-Tech-in-Silicon-Valley">Public Interest Tech in Silicon Valley</a>: Mitchell Baker, Chairwoman, Mozilla Corporation; Cindy Cohn, EFF; and Lucy Vasserman, Software Engineer, Google. (Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SL5qMwDkW0">here</a>.)</p>

<p><li><a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19/agenda/sessions/16901-Working-in-Civil-Society">Working in Civil Society</a>: Sarah Aoun, Digital Security Technologist; Peter Eckersley, Partnership on AI; Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security, Freedom of the Press Foundation; and John Scott-Railton, Senior Researcher, Citizen Lab. (Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOFsvgDU6BA">here</a>.)</p>

<p><li><a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19/agenda/sessions/16902-Government-Needs-You">Government Needs You</a>: Travis Moore, TechCongress; Hashim Mteuzi, Senior Manager, Network Talent Initiative, Code for America; Gigi Sohn, Distinguished Fellow, Georgetown Law Institute for Technology, Law and Policy; and Ashkan Soltani, Independent Consultant. (Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjMYcgW2ywM">here</a>.)</p>

<p><li><a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19/agenda/sessions/16906-Changing-Academia">Changing Academia</a>: Latanya Sweeney, Harvard; Dierdre Mulligan, UC Berkeley; and Danny Weitzner, MIT CSAIL. (Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR3bYCg5ZsQ">here</a>.)</p>

<p><li><a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19/agenda/sessions/16907-The-Future-of-Public-Interest-Tech">The Future of Public Interest Tech</a>: Bruce Schneier, Fellow and Lecturer, Harvard Kennedy School; Ben Wizner, ACLU; and Jenny Toomey, Director, Internet Freedom, Ford Foundation (Moderator). (Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH0foDZRpbM">here</a>.)</ul>

<p>I also conducted eight short video interviews with different people involved in public-interest technology: independent security technologist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBZOxKCN7ZE">Sarah Aoun</a>, TechCongress's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHLKvqpfh4g">Travis Moore</a>, Ford Foundation's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQEnqLASrN4">Jenny Toomey</a>, CitizenLab's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zq7s-1lzS8">John-Scott Railton</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEILBEQCkKU">Dierdre Mulligan</a> from UC Berkeley, ACLU's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deyUuUsOSB8">Jon Callas</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxlwTnLjvw">Matt Mitchell</a> of TacticalTech, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL1fGlHnhNk">Kelley Misata</a> from Sightline Security.</p>

<p>Here is my <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/blogs/the-public-interest-technologist-track-at-the-rsa-conference">blog post</a> about the event. Here's Ford Foundation's <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/blogs/why-ford-foundation-is-helping-bruce-schneier-bring-a-new-field-to-rsa-conference-in-2019">blog post</a> on why they helped me organize the event.</p>

(Hey MeriTalk: you spelled my name wrong.)</p>

<p>Related: Here's my <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2019/02/public-interest_tech.html">longer essay</a> on the need for public-interest technologists in Internet security, and my <a href="https://public-interest-tech.com/">public-interest technology resources page</a>.</p>

<p>And just so we have all the URLs in one place, <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/videos?conference=&tags%5B%5D=Public+Interest+Tech&keywords=&page=1">here</a> is a page from the RSA Conference website with links to all of the videos.</p>

<p>If you liked this mini-track, please rate it highly on your RSA Conference evaluation form. I'd like to do it again next year.</p>

	    <p>It seems that someone from a company called Swift Recovery Ltd. is impersonating me -- at least on Telegram. The person is using a photo of me, and is using details of my life available on Wikipedia to convince people that they are me.</p>

<p>They are not.</p>

<p>If anyone has any more information -- stories, screen shots of chats, etc. -- please forward them to me.<br />

	    <p>My <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">latest book</a> is doing well. And I've been giving lots of talks and interviews about it. (I can recommend three interviews: the <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/cyberlaw-podcast-click-here-kill-everybody">Cyberlaw podcast</a> with Stewart Baker, the <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-bruce-schneier-click-here-kill-everybody">Lawfare podcast</a> with Ben Wittes, and <a href="http://harryshearer.com/le-shows/november-11-2018/">Le Show</a> with Harry Shearer.) My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkJCI3_jbtg">book talk</a> at Google is also available.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Click-Here-to-Kill-Everybody-Audiobook/B07KJ9TRSK">Audible version</a> was delayed for reasons that were never adequately explained to me, but it's finally out.</p>

<p>I still have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/order.html">signed copies</a> available. Be aware that this is both slower and more expensive than online bookstores.</p>

	    <p>It's impossible to know all the details, but <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">my latest book</a> seems to be selling well. Initial reviews have been really positive: <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/09/04/great-if-we-dont-fuck-up.html">Boing Boing</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2018/08/click_here_to_kill_e.html"><i>Financial Times</i></a>, <a href="https://www.harrisonline.com/book-review-click-here-to-kill-everybody/">Harris Online</a>, <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bruce-schneier/click-here-to-kill-everybody/"><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06033-9">Nature</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2018/09/11/takeaways-from-bruce-schneiers-new-book-336012"><i>Politico</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.virusbulletin.com/blog/2018/09/book-review-click-here-kill-everybody/">Virus Bulletin</a>.</p>

<p>I've also done a bunch of interviews -- either written or radio/podcast -- including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/09/04/hackers-used-a-fishtank-to-break-into-a-vegas-casino-were-all-in-trouble/"><i>Washington Post</i></a>, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9dj8h7/i_am_bruce_schneier_cybersecurity_expert_author/">Reddit AMA</a>, "<a href="https://the1a.org/shows/2018-09-04/click-here-to-kill-everybody">The 1A </a>" on NPR,  <a href="https://www.blubrry.com/the_security_ledger_podcasts/37466396/podcast-episode-111-click-here-to-kill-everybody-and-cybersn-on-why-security-talent-walks/">Security Ledger</a>, <a href=" https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611948/for-safetys-sake-we-must-slow-innovation-in-internet-connected-things/ "><i>MIT Technology Review</i></a>, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/spark-405-1.4822008/internet-plus-now-everything-can-be-hacked-1.4824151">CBC Radio</a>, and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2018/09/vulnerabilities_of_a.html">WNYC Radio</a>.</p>

<p>There have been others -- like the Lawfare, Cyberlaw, and Hidden Forces podcasts -- but they haven't been published yet. I also did a book talk at Google that should appear on YouTube soon.</p>

<p>If you've bought and read the book, thank you. Please consider leaving a review on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Click-Here-Kill-Everybody-Hyper-connected-dp-0393608883/dp/0393608883/">Amazon</a>.</p>

	    <p>From the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/science/squid-camouflage-colors.html">New York Times</a></i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08891-x">a paper published last week in Nature Communications</a> suggests that their chromatophores, previously thought to be mainly pockets of pigment embedded in their skin, are also equipped with tiny reflectors made of proteins. These reflectors aid the squid to produce such a wide array of colors, including iridescent greens and blues, within a second of passing in front of a new background. The research reveals that by using tricks found in other parts of the animal kingdom -- like shimmering butterflies and peacocks -- squid are able to combine multiple approaches to produce their vivid camouflage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Researchers studied Doryteuthis pealeii, or the longfin squid.</p>

<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven't covered.</p>

	    <p>They have <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/in-the-era-of-electronic-warfare-bring-back-pigeons/">advantages</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pigeons are certainly no substitute for drones, but they provide a low-visibility option to relay information. Considering the storage capacity of microSD memory cards, a pigeon's organic characteristics provide front line forces a relatively clandestine mean to transport gigabytes of video, voice, or still imagery and documentation over considerable distance with zero electromagnetic emissions or obvious detectability to radar. These decidedly low-technology options prove difficult to detect and track. Pigeons cannot talk under interrogation, although they are not entirely immune to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/3229526/Iran-arrests-pigeons-spying-on-nuclear-site.html">being held under suspicion of espionage</a>. Within an urban environment, a pigeon has even greater potential to blend into the local avian population, further compounding detection.</p></blockquote>

<p>The author points out that both France and China still maintain a small number of pigeons in case electronic communications are disrupted. </p>

	    <p>Both the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are <a href="https://qz.com/1458475/the-dea-and-ice-are-hiding-surveillance-cameras-in-streetlights/">hiding</a> surveillance cameras in streetlights.</p>

<blockquote><p>According to <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?s=FPDSNG.COM&templateName=1.4.4&indexName=awardfull&q=VENDOR_DUNS_NUMBER%3A%22085189089%22">government procurement data</a>, the DEA has paid a Houston, Texas company called Cowboy Streetlight Concealments LLC roughly $22,000 since June 2018 for "video recording and reproducing equipment." ICE paid out about $28,000 to Cowboy Streetlight Concealments over the same period of time.

<p>It's unclear where the DEA and ICE streetlight cameras have been installed, or where the next deployments will take place. ICE offices in Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio have provided funding for recent acquisitions from Cowboy Streetlight Concealments; the DEA's most recent purchases were funded by the agency's Office of Investigative Technology, which is located in Lorton, Virginia.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fifty thousand dollars doesn't buy a lot of streetlight surveillance cameras, so either this is a pilot program or there are a lot more procurements elsewhere that we don't know about.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cephalopods - squid, cuttlefish and octopuses - change colour by using tiny muscles in their skins to stretch out small sacs of black colouration.

<p>These sacs are located in the animal's skin cells, and when a cell is ready to change colour, the brain sends a signal to the muscles and they contract.</p>

<p>This makes the sacs expand and creates the optical effect which makes the animal look like it is changing colour.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>To mimic these natural mechanisms, the team used "smart" electro-active polymeric materials, connected to an electric circuit.</p>

<p>When a voltage was applied, the materials contracted; they returned to their original shape when they were short-circuited.</p>

<p>"These artificial muscles can replicate the [natural] muscular actionâ¦ and can have strong visual effects," said Dr Rossiter.</p>

<p>"These materials, and this approach, is ideal for making smart colour-changing skins or soft devices in which fluid is pumped from one place to another.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In an effort to shield their still-secret products from prying eyes, automakers testing prototype models, often in the desert and at other remote locales, have long covered the grilles and headlamps with rubber, vinyl and tape Â­ the perfunctory equivalent of masks and hats. Now the old materials are being replaced or supplemented with patterned wrappings applied like wallpaper. Test cars are wearing swirling paisley patterns, harlequin-style diamonds and cubist zigzags. </p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011757"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/09/evidence_for_th.html">Evidence for the Security of PKCS #1 Digital Signatures</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>This is interesting research: "<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/855">On the Security of the PKCS#1 v1.5 Signature Scheme</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature algorithm is the most widely used digital signature scheme in practice. Its two main strengths are its extreme simplicity, which makes it very easy to implement, and that verification of signatures is significantly faster than for DSA or ECDSA. Despite the huge practical importance of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures, providing formal evidence for their security based on plausible cryptographic hardness assumptions has turned out to be very difficult. Therefore the most recent version of PKCS#1 (RFC 8017) even recommends a replacement the more complex and less efficient scheme RSA-PSS, as it is provably secure and therefore considered more robust. The main obstacle is that RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures use a deterministic padding scheme, which makes standard proof techniques not applicable.

<p>We introduce a new technique that enables the first security proof for RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures. We prove full existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) under the standard RSA assumption. Furthermore, we give a tight proof under the Phi-Hiding assumption. These proofs are in the random oracle model and the parameters deviate slightly from the standard use, because we require a larger output length of the hash function. However, we also show how RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures can be instantiated in practice such that our security proofs apply.</p>

<p>In order to draw a more complete picture of the precise security of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures, we also give security proofs in the standard model, but with respect to weaker attacker models (key-only attacks) and based on known complexity assumptions. The main conclusion of our work is that from a provable security perspective RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 can be safely used, if the output length of the hash function is chosen appropriately.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't think the protocol is "provably secure," meaning that it cannot have any vulnerabilities. What this paper demonstrates is that there are no vulnerabilities under the model of the proof. And, more importantly, that PKCS #1 v1.5 is as secure as any of its successors like <a href="https://rsapss.hboeck.de/rsapss.pdf">RSA-PSS</a> and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/ro.pdf">RSA Full-Domain</a>.</p>

	    <p>Lots of people are e-mailing me about <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-chemist-shines-light-on-a-surprising-prime-number-pattern-20180514/">this new result</a> on the distribution of prime numbers. While interesting, it has nothing to do with cryptography. Cryptographers aren't interested in how to find prime numbers, or even in the distribution of prime numbers. Public-key cryptography algorithms like RSA get their security from the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers that are the product of two prime numbers. That's completely different.</p>

	    <p>Recently, Apple introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/07/apple-releases-ios-11-4-1-tvos-11-4-1-homepod-11-4-1-and-watchos-4-3-2/">restricted mode</a> to protect iPhones from attacks by companies like <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/02/cellebrite_unlo.html">Cellebrite</a> and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/02/cellebrite_unlo.html">Greyshift</a>, which allow attackers to recover information from a phone without the password or fingerprint. Elcomsoft <a href="https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2018/07/this-9-device-can-defeat-ios-usb-restricted-mode/">just announced</a> that it can easily bypass it.</p>

<p>There is an important lesson in this: security is hard. Apple Computer has one of the best security teams on the planet. This feature was not tossed out in a day; it was designed and implemented with a lot of thought and care. If this team could make a mistake like this, imagine how bad a security feature is when implemented by a team without this kind of expertise.</p>

<p>This is the reason actual cryptographers and security engineers are very skeptical when a random company announces that their product is "secure." We know that they don't have the requisite security expertise to design and implement security properly. We know they didn't take the time and care. We know that their engineers think they understand security, and designed to a level that <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html">they couldn't break</a>.</p>

<p>Getting security right is hard for the best teams on the world. It's impossible for average teams.</p>

	    <p>EFF is <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/attention-pgp-users-new-vulnerabilities-require-you-take-action-now">reporting</a> that a critical vulnerability has been discovered in PGP and S/MIME. No details have been published yet, but one of the <a href="https://twitter.com/seecurity/status/995906576170053633">researchers wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We'll publish critical vulnerabilities in PGP/GPG and S/MIME email encryption on 2018-05-15 07:00 UTC. They might reveal the plaintext of encrypted emails, including encrypted emails sent in the past. There are currently no reliable fixes for the vulnerability. If you use PGP/GPG or S/MIME for very sensitive communication, you should disable it in your email client for now.</p></blockquote>

<p>This sounds like a protocol vulnerability, but we'll learn more tomorrow.</p>

	    <p>Interesting symmetric cipher: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/339">LC4</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> ElsieFour (LC4) is a low-tech cipher that can be computed by hand; but unlike many historical ciphers, LC4 is designed to be hard to break. LC4 is intended for encrypted communication between humans only, and therefore it encrypts and decrypts plaintexts and ciphertexts consisting only of the English letters A through Z plus a few other characters. LC4 uses a nonce in addition to the secret key, and requires that different messages use unique nonces. LC4 performs authenticated encryption, and optional header data can be included in the authentication. This paper defines the LC4 encryption and decryption algorithms, analyzes LC4's security, and describes a simple appliance for computing LC4 by hand.</p></blockquote>

<p>Almost two decades ago I designed <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/solitaire/">Solitaire</a>, a pen-and-paper cipher that uses a deck of playing cards to store the cipher's state. This algorithm uses specialized tiles. This gives the cipher designer more options, but it can be incriminating in a way that regular playing cards are not.</p>

<p>Still, I like seeing more designs like this.</p>

	    <p>The ISO has <a href="https://www.wikitribune.com/story/2018/04/20/internet/67004/67004/">rejected</a> two symmetric encryption algorithms: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/404.pdf">SIMON and SPECK</a>. These algorithms were both designed by the NSA and made public in 2013. They are optimized for small and low-cost processors like IoT devices.</p>

<p>The risk of using NSA-designed ciphers, of course, is that they include NSA-designed backdoors. Personally, I doubt that they're backdoored. And I always like <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/07/simon_and_speck.html">seeing NSA-designed cryptography</a> (particularly its key schedules). It's like examining alien technology.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (5/14): Why the algorithms were <a href="https://twitter.com/TomerAshur/status/988696306674630656">rejected</a>.</p>

	    <p>Almost 20 years ago, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-prngs.pdf">wrote a paper</a> that pointed to a potential flaw in the ANSI X9.17 RNG standard. Now, <a href="https://duhkattack.com/">new research</a> has found that the flaw exists in some implementations of the RNG standard.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://duhkattack.com/paper.pdf">research paper</a>, the <a href="https://duhkattack.com/#paper">website</a> -- complete with cute logo -- for the attack, and Matthew Green's <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2017/10/23/attack-of-the-week-duhk/">excellent blog post</a> on the research.</p>

	    <p>A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/crypto-failure-cripples-millions-of-high-security-keys-750k-estonian-ids/">security flaw</a> in Infineon smart cards and TPMs allows an attacker to recover private keys from the public keys. Basically, the key generation algorithm sometimes creates public keys that are vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%27s_attack">Coppersmith's attack</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>While all keys generated with the library are much weaker than they should be, it's not currently practical to factorize all of them. For example, 3072-bit and 4096-bit keys aren't practically factorable. But oddly enough, the theoretically stronger, longer 4096-bit key is much weaker than the 3072-bit key and may fall within the reach of a practical (although costly) factorization if the researchers' method improves.

<p>To spare time and cost, attackers can first test a public key to see if it's vulnerable to the attack. The test is inexpensive, requires less than 1 millisecond, and its creators believe it produces practically zero false positives and zero false negatives. The fingerprinting allows attackers to expend effort only on keys that are practically factorizable.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/09/security_flaw_i.html">flaw</a> in the Estonian national ID card we learned about last month.</p>

<p>The paper isn't online yet. I'll post it when it is.</p>

<p>Ouch. This is a bad vulnerability, and it's in systems -- like the Estonian national ID card -- that are critical.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (11/14): More <a href="https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17">information</a> from the researchers.</p>

	    <p>Turns out that the software a bunch of CAs used to generate public-key certificates <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-google-godaddy-misissued-tls-certificates-with-weak-serial-numbers/">was</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/godaddy-apple-and-google-goof-results-in-1-million-misissued-certificates/">flawed</a>: they created random serial numbers with only 63 bits instead of the required 64. That may not seem like a big deal to the layman, but that one bit change means that the serial numbers only have half the required entropy. This really isn't a security problem; the serial numbers are to protect against attacks that involve weak hash functions, and we don't allow those weak hash functions anymore. Still, it's a good thing that the CAs are reissuing the certificates. The point of a standard is that it's to be followed.<br />

	    <p>An <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2938033">article I co-wrote</a> -- my first law journal article -- was <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/03/06/12564.pdf">cited</a> by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court -- the state supreme court -- in a case on compelled decryption.</p>

<p>Here's the first, in footnote 1:</p>

<blockquote><p>We understand the word "password" to be synonymous with other terms that cell phone users may be familiar with, such as Personal Identification Number or "passcode." Each term refers to the personalized combination of letters or digits that, when manually entered by the user, "unlocks" a cell phone. For simplicity, we use "password" throughout. See generally, Kerr & Schneier, Encryption Workarounds, 106 Geo. L.J. 989, 990, 994, 998 (2018).</p></blockquote>

<p>And here's the second, in footnote 5:</p>

<blockquote><p>We recognize that ordinary cell phone users are likely unfamiliar with the complexities of encryption technology. For instance, although entering a password "unlocks" a cell phone, the password itself is not the "encryption key" that decrypts the cell phone's contents. See Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em> at 995. Rather, "entering the [password] decrypts the [encryption] key, enabling the key to be processed and unlocking the phone. This two-stage process is invisible to the casual user." <em>Id</em>. Because the technical details of encryption technology do not play a role in our analysis, they are not worth belaboring. Accordingly, we treat the entry of a password as effectively decrypting the contents of a cell phone. For a more detailed discussion of encryption technology, see generally Kerr & Schneier, <em>supra</em>.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011962"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/on_the_security_1.html">On the Security of Password Managers</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>There's <a href="https://www.securityevaluators.com/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/">new research</a> on the security of password managers, specifically 1Password, Dashlane, KeePass, and Lastpass. This work specifically looks at password leakage on the host computer. That is, does the password manager accidentally leave plaintext copies of the password lying around memory?</p>

<blockquote><p>All password managers we examined sufficiently secured user secrets while in a "not running" state. That is, if a password database were to be extracted from disk and if a strong master password was used, then brute forcing of a password manager would be computationally prohibitive.

<p>Each password manager also attempted to scrub secrets from memory. But residual buffers remained that contained secrets, most likely due to memory leaks, lost memory references, or complex GUI frameworks which do not expose internal memory management mechanisms to sanitize secrets.</p>

<p>This was most evident in 1Password7 where secrets, including the master password and its associated secret key, were present in both a locked and unlocked state. This is in contrast to 1Password4, where at most, a single entry is exposed in a "running unlocked" state and the master password exists in memory in an obfuscated form, but is easily recoverable. If 1Password4 scrubbed the master password memory region upon successful unlocking, it would comply with all proposed security guarantees we outlined earlier.</p>

<p>This paper is not meant to criticize specific password manager implementations; however, it is to establish a reasonable minimum baseline which all password managers should comply with. It is evident that attempts are made to scrub and sensitive memory in all password managers. However, each password manager fails in implementing proper secrets sanitization for various reasons.</p></blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>LastPass obfuscates the master password while users are typing in the entry, and when the password manager enters an unlocked state, database entries are only decrypted into memory when there is user interaction. However, ISE reported that these entries persist in memory after the software enters a locked state. It was also possible for the researchers to extract the master password and interacted-with password entries due to a memory leak. 

<p>KeePass scrubs the master password from memory and is not recoverable. However, errors in workflows permitted the researchers from extracting credential entries which have been interacted with. In the case of Windows APIs, sometimes, various memory buffers which contain decrypted entries may not be scrubbed correctly.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether this is a big deal or not depends on whether you consider your computer to be trusted.</p>

<p>Several people have emailed me to ask why my own <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/">Password Safe</a> was not included in the evaluation, and whether it has the same vulnerabilities. My guess about the former is that Password Safe isn't as popular as the others. (This is for two reasons: 1) I don't publicize it very much, and 2) it doesn't have an easy way to synchronize passwords across devices or otherwise store password data in the cloud.) As to the latter: we tried to code Password Safe not to leave plaintext passwords lying around in memory.</p>

<p>So, Independent Security Evaluators: take a look at <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/">Password Safe</a>.</p>

<p>Also, remember the vulnerabilities found in many cloud-based password managers <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/09/security_of_pas.html">back in 2014</a>?</p>

	    <p>Last week, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2019/01/evaluating_the_gchq_.html">evaluated the security</a> of a recent <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">GCHQ backdoor</a> proposal for communications systems. Furthering the debate, Nate Cardozo and Seth Schoen of EFF <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/detecting-ghosts-reverse-engineering-who-ya-gonna-call">explain</a> how this sort of backdoor can be detected:</p>

<blockquote><p>In fact, we think when the ghost feature is activeÂ­ -- silently inserting a secret eavesdropping member into an otherwise end-to-end encrypted conversation in the manner described by the GCHQ authorsÂ­ -- it could be detected (by the target as well as certain third parties) with at least four different techniques: binary reverse engineering, cryptographic side channels, network-traffic analysis, and crash log analysis. Further, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1082054696683085825">crash log analysis</a> could lead unrelated third parties to find evidence of the ghost in use, and it's even possible that binary reverse engineering could lead researchers to find ways to disable the ghost capability on the client side. It should be obvious that none of these possibilities are desirable for law enforcement or society as a whole. And while we've theorized some types of mitigations that might make the ghost less detectable by particular techniques, they could also impose considerable costs to the network when deployed at the necessary scale, as well as creating new potential security risks or detection methods.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other critiques of the system were written by <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">Susan Landau</a> and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">Matthew Green</a>.</p>

	    <p>Impressive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/nyregion/el-chapo-trial.html">police work</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a daring move that placed his life in danger, the I.T. consultant eventually gave the F.B.I. his system's secret encryption keys in 2011 after he had moved the network's servers from Canada to the Netherlands during what he told the cartel's leaders was a routine upgrade.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Dutch article <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nederlandse-politie-tapte-anderhalf-jaar-lang-alle-communicatie-van-mexicaanse-drugsbaron-el-chapo-~bab33a30/">says</a> that it's a BlackBerry system.</p>

<p>El Chapo had his IT person install "...spyware called FlexiSPY on the 'special phones' he had given to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, as well as to two of his lovers, including one who was a former Mexican lawmaker." That same software was used by the FBI when his IT person turned over the keys. Yet again we learn the lesson that a backdoor can be used against you.</p>

<p>And it doesn't have to be with the IT person's permission. A good intelligence agency can use the IT person's authorizations without his knowledge or consent. This is why the NSA <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/03/20/inside-nsa-secret-efforts-hunt-hack-system-administrators/">hunts sysadmins</a>.</p>

	    <p>Former Facebook CISO Alex Stamos <a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1078677650414006272">argues</a> that increasing political pressure on social media platforms to moderate content will give them a pretext to turn all end-to-end crypto off -- which would be more profitable for them and bad for society.</p>

<blockquote><p>If we ask tech companies to fix ancient societal ills that are now reflected online with moderation, then we will end up with huge, democratically-unaccountable organizations controlling our lives in ways we never intended. And those ills will still exist below the surface.</p></blockquote>

Note: Many people e-mailed me to ask why I haven't blogged this yet. One, I was busy with other things. And two, there's nothing I can say that I haven't <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">said</a> many times before.</p>

<p>If there are more good links or commentary, please post them in the comments.</p>

<p>April Fools hoax stories could offer clues to help identify 'fake news':<br />
<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190329130206.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190329130206.htm</a></p>

<p>"Researchers focused on specific features within the texts, such as the amount of details used, vagueness, formality of writing style and complexity of language.<br />
They found April Fools hoaxes and fake news articles tend to contain less complex language, an easier reading difficulty, and longer sentences than genuine news.</p>

<p>Important details for news stories, such as names, places, dates and times, were found to be used less frequently within April Fools hoaxes and fake news.</p>

<p>The researchers found that April fools hoax stories, when compared to genuine news:<br />
â¢Are generally shorter in length<br />
â¢Use more unique words<br />
â¢Use longer sentences<br />
â¢Are easier to read<br />
â¢Refer to vague events in the future<br />
â¢Contain more references to the present<br />
â¢Are less interested in past events<br />
â¢Contain fewer proper nouns<br />
â¢Use more first person pronouns</p>

<p>Fake news stories, when compared to genuine news:<br />
â¢Are shorter in length<br />
â¢Are easier to read<br />
â¢Use simplistic language<br />
â¢Contain fewer punctuation marks<br />
â¢Contain more proper nouns<br />
â¢Are generally less formal -- use more first names such as 'Hillary' and contain more profanity and spelling mistakes<br />
â¢Contain very few dates<br />
â¢Use more first person pronouns</p>

<p>The researchers also created a machine learning 'classifier' to identify if articles are April Fools hoaxes, fake news or genuine news stories. The classifier achieved a 75 per cent accuracy at identifying April Fools articles and 72 per cent for identifying fake news stories. When the classifier was trained on April Fools hoaxes and set the task of identifying fake news it recorded an accuracy of more than 65 per cent.</p>

<p>"Our findings suggest that there are certain features in common between different forms of disinformation and exploring these similarities may provide important insights for future research into deceptive news stories."</p>

<p>Is it possible to train AI classifier to find out degree of truthfulness during LEAs/IC interrogation and/or asylum seeking interviews?<br />

<p><b>"Emails of nearly 1 billion people leaked in massive data breach"</b> </p>

<p><i>"The emails of nearly 1 billion people were leaked in what experts say is likely the biggest data breach of all time, according to reports.</i></p>

<p>At least 982 million usersâ personal information was exposed during the tech firm Verifications.ioâs massive privacy breach late last month, according to Unilad.co.uk."</p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/29/emails-of-nearly-1-billion-people-leaked-in-massive-data-breach/" rel="nofollow">https://nypost.com/2019/03/29/emails-of-nearly-1-billion-people-leaked-in-massive-data-breach/</a>  (and many other sites)</p>

<p>Seems our data is hopelessly insecure. I read somewhere .io urls were notoriously corrupted and used by criminals. Guess this is somewhat of a proof.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I looked myself up on a free website recently. Amazing detail is available, for free, about me who tries to keep his data off the grid.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure the only way to fix this is to re-invent the internet from the bottom up. Start all over. Not going to happen though, is it?</p>

<p><b>"The EU tentatively backed a plan to fit every car starting in 2022 with a device meant to automatically stop drivers from speeding"</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eu-fit-new-cars-software-stop-breaking-speed-limit-after-2022-2019-3" rel="nofollow">https://www.businessinsider.com/eu-fit-new-cars-software-stop-breaking-speed-limit-after-2022-2019-3</a></p>

<p> "The European Union has approved draft legislation that would require every new car sold in Europe starting in 2022 to include software meant to slow drivers down when they speed.<br />
The "Intelligent Speed Assistance" software uses a combination of GPS, sign-recognition cameras, and maps to work out whether a vehicle is passing the local speed limit."</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the article:</p>

<p>"Drivers would be able to override the software by pushing hard on the accelerator."</p>

<p>All kinds of issues with this decree, starting with the technology that allows the government to literally minutely track AND drive your car. I have to stop here, else resort to an unpleasant rant.</p>

</p>
<p>@Alejandro:</p>

<p>"the technology that allows the government to literally minutely track AND drive your car."</p>

<p>The technology already exists and has been in use in a high end Japanese sports car, and a variation is going into Fords,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/does-it-work-fords-intelligent-speed-limiter-car-september-2015/" rel="nofollow">https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/does-it-work-fords-intelligent-speed-limiter-car-september-2015/</a></p>

<p>Whilst the driver in the car knows where it is like any other with GPS, unlike other systems in US cars it is not going to 'track' back to the government minutely or otherwise.</p>

<p>But a proposal to track peoples cars by GPS minutely was given consideration by the UK Government a decade or so ago with respect to setting up 'electronic tolls' to replace the 'Road Fund' vehicle tax. It was in part ditched because the tracking would not have been 'minutely' enough due to the positional error of GPS. In the UK there are numerous numbers of 'local traffic' B roads,that run right next to 'through traffic' A roads and 'long distance traffic' Motorways (see London A4/M4 Westway on a flyover above the local roads for instance). The problem although long known was highlighted by a German system for transport vehicals,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/09/motoring.transportintheuk" rel="nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/09/motoring.transportintheuk</a></p>

<p>This same problem will happen with this new EU proposal for exactly the same reason. Because generally B roads have a considerably lower speed limit than A roads, but not all the time as with motorways some A roads can have their speed limit changed several times a day based not on the time of day but on the weight of traffic*. It is possible and has happened I've seen it on more than a couple of occasions when biking that the A road speed limit gets taken down below the B road limit. With the error term in GPS this is a recipe for not just accidents but litigation as well.</p>

<p>It's probably the reason Ford decided to try using OCR techniques to read road signs. Such a system provided the roads are corectly marked --and few are in rural areas-- would not need to use tracking at all.</p>

<p>* The reason for this is the 'stopping distance' issue. Put simply stoping distance has two components 'thinking distance' and 'brakeing distance', whilst thinking distance is proportional to speed breaking distance is related to speed squared. Thus the safe density of cars on a road is related to speed squared. Slow the speed just a little and the number of vehicles in any given section of road goes up to a power law, which means total safe throuput of vehicles in any given time also goes up to the same power law.   </p>

</p>
<p>On the Squid article,</p>

<p>"'Stuffing an animal skin with a foam rubber replicaâthe classic methodâdoesn't work for squids,'"</p>

<p>Did make me smile.</p>

<p>Use of 'foam rubber' is actually 'the modern way' of the 'traditional process'. In times past, Plaster of Paris has been used as well as those good old furniture stuffing materials straw, horse hair, and cotton waste (all of which attract moths and other 'wee beasties' as kindergartens).</p>

<p>Plastification is very much not the traditional method and in taxidermy is concidered an entirely new ultra modern uncertain method that is not yet trusted. Because it derives from an earlier process where blood vessels were filled with a fluid that became plastic then the flesh was disolved away. There is thus the question of the 'preserving factor' of the original organic material and will it last three or four centuries or more that the 'traditional methods' can do.</p>

<p>I guess another example of 'journalistic licence'. </p>

<p>Brief description of the Verifications[.]io breach here:<br />
<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#VerificationsIO" rel="nofollow">https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#VerificationsIO</a><br />
Note that while sources say 900(ish)-million records were exposed, Troy Hunt reports that "only" 763M email addresses were exposed.</p>

<p>You might be interested to know that Mr Hunt makes it possible for anyone to interrogate his database of leaked passphrases.  I just learned of it.<br />

1) make an SHA1 hash of the passphrase you want to look for.  In a Linux terminal:<br />
echo -n "password" | sha1sum<br />
and this hash is returned:<br />
5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8</p>

<p>2) Send the LEFT-MOST 5 characters of that hash via your web browser.  In the address bar: <a href="https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/5baa6" rel="nofollow">https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/5baa6</a></p>

<p>That returns a variable number of lines, in the form [PARTIALHASH:#] , where PARTIALHASH is characters 6-35 of a hash and # is the number of times a password having this hash has been seen in a breach.  In this case, 512 records are returned.</p>

<p>You scroll thru the list, looking for your hash <br />
(remembering to skip chars 1-5)<br />
^^^^^1e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8<br />
In the case at hand, we get a hit at the 67th record:<br />
1E4C9B93F3F0682250B6CF8331B7EE68FD8:3645804</p>

<p>Conclusion: the password "password" was seen 3,645,804 times, so decidedly not suitable for a passphrase.  :-)</p>

<p>@vas pup</p>

<p>"Is it possible to train AI classifier to find out degree of truthfulness during LEAs/IC interrogation and/or asylum seeking interviews?"</p>

<p>You realize that a 75% accuracy rate (not to mention the 65% rate) on a true/false task is a very limited improvement over the accuracy of random guessing, which is 50% (on an evenly distributed population) with no learning at all.  If the test data is 80% real news, then always guessing real beats this result.</p>

<p>Have you considered that this article has most of the markers of fake news itself?  It certainly doesn't tell us the significance of the results, which seem likely not to be significant.</p>

<p>THIS is the danger of AI:  Applying some woo woo technology to at risk populations without considering whether it makes any sense.</p>

<p>Outside of trying to apply such a marginal capability to actual people, the fact that hoaxes and fake news appear to be correlated is interesting, but I guess not too surprising.</p>

<p>Good for Utah:</p>

<p>Gov. Herbert signs bill requiring police obtain search warrants to access electronic information<br />
March 28, 2019</p>

<blockquote>SALT LAKE CITY â Gov. Gary Herbert signed off on HB57 on Wednesday designating Utah as the state with the strongest data privacy laws in the country when it comes to law enforcement accessing electronic information.

<p><br />
[. . .]</p>

<p>âIn particular it protects information that is passed on to a third party,â [Rep. Craig] Hall [R-Utah] said. âSo, for example, if an individual decides to draft a document and they store it on their computer, then law enforcement would have to seek and obtain a warrant before that computerâs hard drive could be searched. But what happens if the individuals store their document with Dropbox or Google Drive? Well, in the past, law enforcement has not had the requirement to seek such information by warrant. This bill makes clear that the protections we have in the physical world are also given in the electronic world.â</p></blockquote>

<p>@Faustus and @wHumma:<br />
Thank you for your input!<br />
My guess that rate would gradually increase as soon as more training information is provided to AI, so rate could be sufficiently more as random guess.<br />
AI just tool to select cases for close attention of human analyst/interrogator, not as tool for final judgment.  </p>

<p>@ vas pup</p>

<p>There is no reason to think the results would improve when the initial results are so bad.  My classifiers are way beyond this accuracy in a few minutes of processing.  If this happened to me I would conclude no appreciable training effect.</p>

<p>An analysis would go like this: Say with perfect knowledge 10% of people deserve further scrutiny.  Take two hundred people.  20 deserve further scrutiny and 180 do not.  Say the accuracy of the proposed process is 75%, per this study.  Out of the 20 actual positives, 15 will be detected and 5 missed.  Out of the actual negatives, 45 will be false positives.  </p>

<p>So you will have 3 TIMES AS MANY FALSE POSITIVES AS ACCURATE POSITIVES.  This just gets worse as the percentage of actual positives goes down in the population.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is massively unfair to subject someone to law enforcement attention based on such an inaccurate classifier.  It really is dystopian.  Everyone will fail some classifier.  And being identified as a suspect to law enforcement is expensive to defend (in money, time and life impact) and often puts at-risk people on a train to being found guilty of SOMETHING, when they are no more guilty than anyone else.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is: There is a real danger of massive false positives in using a weak classifier to detect a relatively uncommon condition.  Or: A weak classifier is worse than no classifier at all.</p>

<p>This is why doctors usually advise against massive preventative testing.  If the decision to test is not based upon symptoms there is often a large chance of false positives leading to unnecessary procedures which statistically will be more harmful than not detecting whatever the test is for, in the small chance the condition is actually present.<br />

<p><i>A viewer would need visual acuity 17,000 times better than normal to see the Great Wall from the Moon.</i></p>

<p>Thank you! Next time I'll try not to forget to include &lt;hyperbole&gt;&lt;/hyperbole&gt; tags.</p>

<p>I had some fun today with the pwned data set mentioned above.</p>

<p>I wrote a silly little bash script that lets me explore various passwords.</p>

<blockquote>
# Execute this command in bash to turn off history substitution
# before running this script if the passwords include bangs ("!"). 
# (Has no effect within the script; there appears to be no reasonable
# way to otherwise escape bangs)
set +H

<p># Uses mostly standard *nix utilities, excepted the following<br />
# which might need to be installed: <br />
# dos2unix<br />
# cache directory must be created beforehand</p>

<p>urlbase="https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/"<br />
cachebase="cache/"<br />
password="$@"</p>

<p>chopchop=$(echo -n "$password" | sha1sum | sed 's/[^a-f,0-9]/\n/' | head -n 1)</p>

<p>prefix=$(echo $chopchop | cut -c 1-5)<br />
suffix=$(echo $chopchop | cut -c 6-)</p>

<p>sigfile=$cachebase$prefix.txt</p>

<p>echo "PW     : $password"<br />
echo "Hash   : $chopchop"<br />
echo "Prefix : $prefix..................................."<br />
echo "Suffix : .....$suffix"</p>

<p>if ! [ -a $sigfile ];then<br />
   curl $urlbase$prefix 2&gt;/dev/null | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | dos2unix &gt; $sigfile<br />
fi</p>

<p>echo $(grep . -c $sigfile) entries in signature file</p>

<p>result="$password : $(grep $suffix $sigfile)"<br />
echo $result<br />
echo $result &gt;&gt;logfile<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The signature files are cached. I convert to lower case on the fly, and change the delimiters to *nix style, otherwise grep does strange things.</p>

<p>I must have checked north of 600. Most combinations I could come up with in any language gave a hit, including the most NSFW ones.</p>

<p>One could even invent a game: each player tries to guess a password, and gets a point (or a score proportional to the count of hits), and keeps playing as long as valid passwords are discovered. Results are stored, and duplicates are not allowed between games. A bit like a modern version of Shannon's tic-tac-toe machine...</p>

<p>I tried combinations including accented letters, but these are apparently very rare. Capitalization is also relatively infrequent. The attempts were made using UTF8; I did try transliterating in ISO8859-1 or Windows 1251, the most represented character sets on the web after UTF8, with about 1% each, but without any results. However, UTF8 coded Cyrillic text is relatively well represented.</p>

<p>The author prefers users to fetch the full file via torrent, which I did, the unpacked dataset is about 25GB. I intend to explore the dataset using various corpora, and expect to be able to fit the signatures to fit in less than 10GB of RAM or less by truncating the number of bits and building one or two indexes.</p>

<p>I traced the <a href="https://i.postimg.cc/HWqjWL4K/pwned1.png" rel="nofollow">counts of the hashes against their rank</a>, and found that the power law exponent is about -0.8 and fits over almost nine decades, which is quite remarkable.<br />

<p>"I forgot to mention that -0.8 is quite close to the reciprocal (-1) relationship of Zipf's law."</p>

<p>Which gives straight lines on log/log paper when plotted (as do a few other 'laws'). It's almost as though those straight lines are 'natural'. Like the odd coincidence of the golden number etc, or fractal patterns.</p>

<p>However a couple of things that always give a crooked line no matter how you plot them is 'military spending' and 'CCTV numbers' ranked against either country or population... Which suggests in turn they are very unnatural :-(<br />

<p>Microsoft: <br />
Windows 10 devices open to 'full compromise' from Huawei PC driver</p>

<p>The investigation led the researcher to the executable MateBookService.exe. Due to a flaw in Huawei's 'watchdog' mechanism for HwOs2Ec10x64.sys, an attacker is able to create a malicious instance of MateBookService.exe to gain elevated privileges.<br />
The flaw can be used to make code running with low privileges read and write to other processes or to kernel space, leading to a "full machine compromise". Microsoft used 'process hollowing', a popular trick used by malware authors, to demonstrate the flaw. Â Â <br />
Of course Germany remains skeptical of unproven American concerns ...<br />

<p>@ Moderator,</p>

<p>Odd goings on with VinnyG's post above.</p>

<p>On the 100 comments page it appeared with the following link,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/friday_squid_bl_670.html#c6790798" rel="nofollow">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/friday_squid_bl_670.html#c6790798</a></p>

<p>But when clicking on it, whilst it opened a new window and brought the browser to this page VinnyG's comment was not yet on the page.</p>

<p>However a few minutes later it is. Whilst I expect that behaviour the other way around with the 100 comments page having delayed update, it's the first time I've seen it this way around.</p>

<p>Also reading VinnyG's comment it appears to have lost the bottom part as it ends in the incompleate sentence,</p>

<ul>"All that could be accomplished in"</ul>

<p>Thanks, no I wasn't aware of it, most of my stuff on Zipf's law is from the 1980's and 1990's, I must have first heard about it when I was interested about fractal geometry, and was fascinated to see that it checked it out in so many different contexts. I wonder whether Shannon had heard about it, IIRC there are no references at all in a Mathematical Theory of Communications.</p>

<p>The exponent I came up with, -0.8, is comparable with those given in table IV of the paper, which range from about -0.5 to -0.9. The smaller values seem to be outliers from very small sets. Chinese datasets appear to result in higher exponents than Latin or Cyrillic dominated datasets. </p>

<p>What I did probably is the same as what is described at section C on p. 2781. I wonder whether some sort of weighting should be used, as the dense central section of the data probably dominates the result. However I think this would only marginally affect the slope of the line, only the offset would be changed.</p>

<p>@Alyer Babtu:</p>

<p>"Suggesting once again that the only I in AI is the flat shadow of the intelligence of the human algorithm deviser"</p>

<p>I guess we should not realy be surprised, but then as a character in a black and white movie once observed 'We expect such things from Frankenstein's monsters godless soul'.</p>

<p>Deities aside, mankind appears to have changed little in 10,000 or more years physically, but what he can and has done is learn to not just live with the limitations, but learn how to use them to advance beyond the point of magic or whatever they could imagine even of those deities they could imagine.</p>

<p>The important point to notice though is that humans can not only feel pain, they can also know fear and death as an intrinsic part of their being. However as of yet machines are just not complex enough to get even close, so can not.</p>

<p>It is that intrinsic set of pain, fear, and death that is the foundation of not just our morals but our development beyond what we can do unassisted by our technology.</p>

<p>If you think about it an AI with physical agencie feels no pain on hard contact, feals no fear of future pain or death and has no understanding of what death might be. So what intrinsically within it is going to stop it hitting things with sufficient force to cause either repairable or even non repairable thus scrappage damage?</p>

<p>So we give it 'rules' but there is an old joke about those 'All rules have exceptions', they are by the logic they work on going to fail in some manner (see works of Kurt GÃ¶del, Church, Turing and others as to why).</p>

<p>But rules are like laws an imposition of morals or simple dictatorship. They teach us to obay not to understand why they are needed not just for us but for others.</p>

<p>We have little knowledge of how humans learn, observations at best because our inate sense of pain gear and death tells us that actually opening people up and inserting probes etc is not what we would want done to us, so we should not do it to others.</p>

<p>There are two old sayings that pop up on most societies irrespective of contact,</p>

<p>1, An eye for an eye.<br />
2, Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.</p>

<p>These only have validity when pain, fear and death have intrinsic meaning. As of yet we have not yet real world fielded A.I. devices with such intrinsic basis for learning.</p>

<p>It is not untill a child gets to around six years old does it start to realise that what it does has consequences to others, and about another ten years befor it's thought they have sufficient understanding not to behave in risky ways behind the controls of a small vehicle. In the mean time we hope that they having riden scooters, skateboards and push bikes have learnt enough via pain and fear, to 'not be stupid or atleast reckless'.</p>

<p>How do we get a machine to learn that way? The fact we can make a machine that can study to play chess in a day such that it can beat the best of humans, says we can get fixed rule discovery mastered but is that 'learnt' or not?</p>

<p>Humans supposadly have 'free will' that is on mass they appear to work by aproximate rules, but individually, no they can chose to follow rules or some interpretation of rules to a lessor greater extent. After all we still kill each other despite the rule 'Though shall not kill'.</p>

<p>We think that 'experience' is what makes us 'interpret rules' and more importantly spot how others are likely to 'interpret rules' before they do, it is after all a primary survival skill.</p>

<p>What the experiment has show is two things,</p>

<p>1, Rules do not cover all eventualities.<br />
2, Humans will exploit others weaknesses for their own advantage.</p>

<p>So how do we make rules to cover for things that we have not seen, our 'black swans' or 'unknown instances of known behaviours' or our more importantly 'unknown instances of unknow behaviours'?</p>

<p>There are things that humans know, things that they can predict, but importantly things that are compleatly unknow to them. Rules can only sort of address part of the first of those and occasionaly some of the second. But what of the third, how do we deal with that? Or more importantly can we make a machine do that beter than we can?</p>

<p>I suspect not untill machines have learnt and understood pain, fear and death, to guide them.</p>

<p>Any way it's getting to that time of day when I should be doing things other than typing round a cup of coffee etc trying to 'saddle up' for thr day ahead.</p>

<p>I beat several dozen passphrases from the old RockYou breach against Troy Hunt's cache, and I found 100% overlap.  Since Hunt does not list RockYou in his Hall of Shame, it seems likely that RockYou was swept into Have I Been Pwned via one of several "credential stuffing" site breaches.  I say "one" because I also noted that the longer, less guessable passwords that appear just once in RockYou have a count of 1 in Hunt's cache as well.  (An example is "100%poopoomachine", which I have adopted as my substitute term for "glitch" and "SNAFU".)</p>

<p>But I wander off the path ...   I came here to mention that I found in the RockYou list an "old friend" from my Enigma message cracking time; the "cilli" is alive and thriving.  Cilli was a term coined at Bletchley during WWII; in short, it meant a predictable letter sequence.  German comms volk had to dream up for each message a "random", three-letter message key, and that must have been a PITA because there is ample and undeniable evidence that some operators regularly made their "random" message keys by simply "walking the keyboard" in some fashion ... horizontal or vertical or down or up.  </p>

<p>My search in RockYou for long, less guessable passphrases paused when I hit "qaz..."/"Qaz...".  There were a lot of them.  And then "qazwsx...".  And then "qazxsw..."/"Qazxsw..."; lots and lots of those.  What accounted for so many unpronounceable yet closely related letter sequences?  Silly me; the answer stared at me but I didn't recognize it until I had stared at one of the two longest "qazxsw..." sequences  - "qazxswedcvfrtgbnhyujmkiolp" -  and noted that no letter appeared twice.</p>

<p>From that point on, I found keyboard-walking almost everywhere I looked.</p>

<p>This one's for vas pup, Clive, Bruce and the other usual suspects.  Human cognitive biases not only prevent them from thinking clearly about arithmetic, but also affect at a deep subconscious level how they treat others, especially ones outside their group ("strangers") or in groups seen as being enemies ("dehumanized").  It took me a long time to get this far, but a convenient starting point is the Schwarzeneggar quote in Terminator 2, "It is in your nature to destroy yourselves."  The hair on the back of my neck stood up when I saw that the first time.  I've posted the youtube link and I am inspired today to find it again and the companion.  An equally profound quote in T2 is "became self-aware..."</p>

<p>Just for the record, one of the first applications of analog computing was aiming weapons systems.  Aiming autonomous weapons across decades and centuries isn't fundamentally different - it's all projected intent, all along the dimensions of space, time and networks - it's just profoundly more dangerous.  Claude Shannon cut his teeth on those analog systems for aiming naval guns and was inspired to consider switches as an alternative.  A decade before he wrote the application of entropy maximization to communication channels.  The last battle with manual aim was Jutland.  I'm pretty sure that I posted Jay Forrester's dinner talk about his on the job training in the south Pacific.  I am writing today almost literally in the shadow of Bell Labs.</p>

<p>In keeping with a theme of dystopian futures (like the one we are in) wrought by rogue government agencies and agents in movies, the military/industrial complex in T2 had a secret program to create artificial intelligence and robotics, which was accelerated by the time loop.  The most powerful force on your planet is error correction feedback.  Your definition of error may not maximize their entropy.  I think that some of us are going to live to see robots fairly similar to the ones in the movie.  Boston Dynamics's Big Dog comes pretty close and you'd be hard-pressed to stop a flock of them armed with M-249 SAWs on a "pacification" mission.  That should be the theme and title of a new video game.  In case you missed the previous translation, "pacification" actually means "kill anything that moves, and we'll cover it up."<br />
 <br />
The darkest part of all this is that it isn't a bug, it's a feature.  By it, I mean the inability to think clearly when group identity/interests/etc are at risk.  That has something to do with why the liars, thieves and murderers (aka politicians) whip up boogeymen whenever the people get restless.  People need and want pychopathic leadership, because they are willing to destroy the neighboring tribe and steal their women, or whatever the modern equivalent is.  Those were the groups that survived and virtually everyone is capable of doing it.  That is exactly what Halliburton and Blackwater pulled off in Iraq and Afghanistan, except the money was being stolen from the US treasury, or whatever passes for a treasury now that they print fiat currency with computers.  Of course, it is a short step from killing the neighboring tribe to stealing from your countrymen.  Which has been done on an unprecedented scale as bin Laden predicted.<br />
 <br />
This is part of why your species are doomed.</p>

...<br />
Yale law school professor Dan Kahan's new research paper is called "Motivated Numeracy and Enlightened Self-Government," but for me a better title is the headline on science writer Chris Mooney's piece about it in Grist: "Science Confirms: Politics Wrecks Your Ability to Do Math."<br />
Kahan conducted some ingenious experiments about the impact of political passion on people's ability to think clearly. His conclusion, in Mooney's words: partisanship "can even undermine our very basic reasoning skills.... [People] who are otherwise very good at math may totally flunk a problem that they would otherwise probably be able to solve, simply because giving the right answer goes against their political beliefs."<br />

<p>@1&1~=Umm @Alyer Babtu</p>

<p>"Suggesting once again that the only I in AI is the flat shadow of the intelligence of the human algorithm deviser"</p>

<p>A lot of people seem to have the AI perspective equivalent to the cryptographic position that "If I can't break the cipher, it must be secure."  In this case: "If I can't imagine how an algorithm can have functionality not programmed by the programmer, it must be impossible."</p>

<p>Ultimately, this is an incorrect idea best addressed by reading an introductory technical book on AI.  However, since that does not seem to be happening I'll explain.</p>

<p>Modern AI algorithms are generally inspired by natural processes: neurons, evolution, ant colony behavior, flocking behavior.  Some are inspired by physical processes, like annealing.  None of these processes incorporate the solutions the AIs create.  They are general processes, say meta-solutions, that process the data and create solutions that in no way are programmed into the system and are in no way a reflection of the algorithm programmer.</p>

<p>I can speak most specifically about my evolutionary technology.  It creates solutions starting with randomness.  The only control I exert is defining the atomic operations that are available to the solver and the data types and variables that it can use if it needs them.  If any of these are inapplicable the solver just doesn't use them.  I also specify a maximum size for the solution so it doesn't grow without bounds.</p>

<p>In no way do I place any limits on the algorithms that my system evolves.  I don't specify them or create them in any way and the solver will produce different solutions for each run (although they will be similar if the solution comes down to a particular equation). </p>

<p>Ultimately the most exciting thing about my system is that it creates solutions that I would be unlikely to ever think of.  It writes solutions to problems that I have no idea how to program myself.  It truly does "Think Differently".</p>

<p>If we changed the statement to:</p>

<p>"Suggesting once again that the AI is the xxxx shadow of the DATA given the algorithm"</p>

<p>it would be closer to true.  If we are training the AI with data, the result will be a reflection of the data.  If the data is garbage, the AI will be garbage.  Data are the "senses" of the AI and they do constrain the results because the AI learns from them.<br />

<p><i>From that point on, I found keyboard-walking almost everywhere I looked.</i></p>

<p>But would you recognize "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu" rel="nofollow">etaoin shdrlu</a> if you saw it? The classic Linotype keyboard walk, operators would use this to eject an erroneous line and start over. Sometimes a line of type would make it into the newspaper. (The article mentions a Pynchon connection, that would be the third one here in the last week).</p>

<p>I get the following counts (last field at the end of the line) with these expressions:</p>

<p>etaoin : a0d8a98054323591e152fe4e4d6c4015447:137<br />
shrdlu : c157f8ca82442e22b21fac30ce7659a6381:251<br />
etaoin shrdlu : 1b5b647b907d16d4a4e9165f29dd44b2870:2<br />
etaoinshrdlu : 0cbfdd14a8959bfb50bdc1cf9491d3bb80d:48<br />
cmfwyp : [no hit]</p>

<p>But these pale in comparison with standard "typewriter" keyboards:</p>

<p>qwerty : 73a05c0ed0176787a4f1574ff0075f7521e:3810555<br />
qwertz : ee6a1ac6ffdbcf8bc0ad72b73795fff34e8:49374<br />
azerty : dacd226dcf43da376cdb6cbba7035218921:309531</p>

<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTZ" rel="nofollow">qwertz</a>" is the standard Germanic (DE, AT, with variants for LU, CH-DE, CH-FR, CH-IT) arrangement, and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY" rel="nofollow">azerty</a>" the wretched French one (FR, BE-FR).</p>

<p>I can't quite explain why there are so much more azerty than qwertz combinations. Is this a data artefact (i.e., FR is overrepresented in the dataset), or a real national habit?</p>

<p>The ease of forming certain combinations on a given keyboard certainly skews the distribution, but I can't quite see yet how to quantify this.</p>

<p>I can fit the entire table in about 5.5GB of RAM. The hashes are truncated to 76 bits. The first 27 bits are used as an index into a lookup table pointing to buckets of aligned 64 bit words. Each 64 bit word contains 49 bits of hash, and a 15 bit index to a 32 bit count table. Each bucket contains on average 4 hashes, which could be examined sequentially at a low cost.</p>

<p>With k=76 bits sub-hash and N=550 million entries, the probability of collisions (N^2)/(2^(k+1)) is about 1 in 500,000, which one can very well live with.</p>

<p>One bit of hash in the 64 bit word could be sacrificed to indicate the end of a bucket. That way I wouldn't have to determine how many items are in a given bucket, or do a lot of pointer arithmetic.</p>

<p>I think that this approach would essentially result in at least two paging faults for every single hash test, unless I could find a way to sort and batch lookup operations, but this would still be way faster than a disk access. I wonder how threading would interact with the caching mechanism.</p>

<p>I would need to find bindings to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/mhash" rel="nofollow">mhash(3)</a>, I have no idea what speeds I could get with the sha1 routine. I've had very good experiences lately with Google-developed non-crypto hash algorithms. Their <a href="https://github.com/google/cityhash" rel="nofollow">cityhash</a> has apparently been superseded, but with hash times measured in nanoseconds for short strings I don't see anything to complain about.</p>

<p>@JG4:</p>

<p>"Just for the record, one of the first applications of analog computing was aiming weapons systems."</p>

<p>Actually it was not "aiming" but "ranging" they are two very distinct processes (aiming is to do with the first part of the projectile trajectory which is sort of line of sight and might deal with the drop, ranging is to do with the second or descending part of an upward directed projectile trajectory (think the difference between a rifle bullet and a mortar round).</p>

<p>Ranging started to use "analogue computation" methods back in the 1600's (if not a lot earlier). Even before the mathmatics behind parabola were even consigned to writing. And long prior to gunpowder being used in Europe.</p>

<p>For mortars and earlier balista of Roman times one such device was very much like a "quadrant". It was set upon the weapon firing bed  so that elevation could be set. It would have different scales for different projectiles and powder charge or winding tension. It was not attached to the weapon permanently because laughable as it might appear now the information was secret even from those 'manning' the weapon (in part in case they decided to rebel).</p>

<p>Even today artillery officers are still taught to use such devices with howitzers and larger field pieces likewise mortars, and yes even now they are often not attached to the weapon. They tend to look like slide rules or their circular equivalents though some are more complicated. </p>

<p>There are still arguments about the knowledge involved with the 'Antikythera Mechanism' from Rhodes, and if that might have come out of knowledge about parbola (you would need the same sort of offset moving pin gearing to calculate it and the ecentricity of the moon's orbit). What ever the connection might or might not be, one thing is clear they knew a lot more than they were previously credited with (in part because much of our pre 1900 historical belief was based on Roman writings that more recent scholars have thrown a lot of doubt upon).</p>

<p>Thanks for your recent post regarding the Bojinka plot.  I assume you already know about this alleged plot to kill President Clinton in the 90s.<br />

<p>@Tat:</p>

<p>"But would you recognize "etaoin shdrlu if you saw it?"</p>

<p>It's a 'sin to er', but yes I did ;-)</p>

<p>But then I would wouldn't I, I'm that kind of geek.</p>

<p>There is an argument about what order the letters actually are in etc, and it depends on your corpus and it's place in time...</p>

<p>I tend to remember it via 'Eat on Irish Lid" and strike duplicates and make two or three swaps (at,ni,ld) depending on the corpus nationality. I was puzzled by the,'r position' in your list though. So followed the link</p>

<p>Yes it's moved in around a century and a half... The sad thing is that I should have remembered Linotype... Their font rivals Monotype* had a factory in the UK built some time before WWII, in the 1980's they built a new factory next door because of asbestos risk in the old building, then they effectively went bankrupt as their market colapsed due to DTP and Adobe products. I know this because for a brief 1 month period in the 1990s I worked in their new building. Why only a month, well I got bad vibes and left, in part because the day we moved in was April the first, and London was warm and sunny 'short shirt sleeve weather' when I left home that morning, at lunchtime at the new factory we had an inch of snow... The company that I had worked for that had moved in a little while after I left also more or less went the way of the dodo... Strangely though stuff I designed and did the software for back then is still being made and sold new, even though it's a tenth the price...</p>

<p>One trivial thing to remember if you are looking at letter frequency in Ceaser ciphers it the 'RST hump' and the 'AE gap'. It's just one of those 'fast tells' when you are 'working it by eye', unless of course it's Rot26, that just jumps straight out of the screen at you ;-)</p>

<p>* The factory was in the delightfully named 'Honeycrock lane, Salfords' (not Salford which is 'Hupt Narf'). There's an aerial photo and a time line at,</p>

<p>@TatÃ¼tata:</p>

<p>My appologies, my above is for you, but for some reason I did not 'Cut-n-Paste' your name correctly.</p>

<p>Oh I also forgot another couple or three pieces of trivia,</p>

<p>1, FRED is the easiest keywalk name (unless you are the music star JK ;-)</p>

<p>2, The top row of the QWERTY keyboard actually has the word 'typewriter' hidden in it for salesmen to look clever...</p>

<p>3, The actual design of the Qwerty lay out was an enginering compromise. The original mechanical design had the problem of certain letters like 'th' together and they used to stick if typed to quickly. The solution, ensure that double letter combinations were not adjacent in the type rack, and also make the actuall layout of the keys such that it slowed you down. The give away on the last one is the middle line which appart from the S is in alphabetical order from the first half of the alphabet.</p>

<p>That third point of 'designed to slow you down' is one of the reasons why office workers can get RSI and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, both of which can easily cripple you for life...</p>

<p>Back in the hay days of big data centers British Telecom had a massive data center in Cardif the capital of Wales. It was absolutly massive back in the 1980s with row after row of IBM main frames that appeared to go as far as the eye could see, when I had reason to visit. But I later heard about evidence given in court on industrial injury to the data entry 'girls'. Apparently they were expected to type in atleast 18,000 digits an hour by hand for eight hours a day, making 'minimal mistakes'. There are times I think that in their fourty hour week they had probably punched in more digits than I ever have on a calculator in my entire life...</p>

<p>Apparently it was not any better back in the 1960/70s when mechanical hand calculators were used by 'male' accounting clerks doing upto 60 hour weeks...</p>

<p>At least unlike in Dickensian times they did not have to provide their own coal and candles...</p>

	    <p>This is an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/how-microsoft-found-a-huawei-driver-that-opened-systems-up-to-attack/">interesting story</a> of a serious vulnerability in a Huawei driver that Microsoft found. The vulnerability is similar in style to the NSA's DOUBLEPULSAR that was leaked by the Shadow Brokers -- believed to be the Russian government -- and it's obvious that this attack copied that technique.</p>

<p>What is less clear is whether the vulnerability -- which has been fixed -- was put into the Huwei driver accidentally or on purpose.</p>

<p>I have another set of questions.</p>

<p>This vulnerability was discovered thank to Microsoft ATP, which uses specific monitorings inside windows kernel. </p>

<p>Can any other vendor perform the same? Or is the Kernel locked to Microsoft?</p>

<p>If locked, from a security standpoint is it better (only Microsoft can alter the kernel with caution and serious security process and review) or worse (in this field the innovation is reduced to Microsoft goodwill and ideas)?<br />

</p>
<p>Process explorer shows that Microsoft allows for extensive Monitoring by userspace programs. </p>

<p>If locking down something is good or bad for security I don't know: the one who gives you the monitoring data might hide anything he wants. Not giving access to monitoring data means nearly anyone can hide his actions but if you allow to monitor things someone might use this data for spying on you in spectre-like days.</p>

<p>@Bruce Schneier:</p>

<p>"What is less clear is whether the vulnerability -- which has been fixed -- was put into the Huwei driver accidentally or on purpose."</p>

<p>Or by whom and under what chain of authority.</p>

<p>There is also the question of 'When' as well.</p>

<p>As the article notes,</p>

<p>"'It also highlights just some of the extraordinarily awful things that hardware vendors do when they're tasked with writing software. When your hardware vendors are opening up big security flaws and copying malware techniques, one wonders if we need protection from the good guys as well as the bad ones.'"</p>

<p>Much of this 'awfulness' stems directly from the way the MicroSoft OS works and alows unknown, unchecked code into and below the kernel and it's limited security provisions.</p>

<p>We do and have for quite sometime know of better ways to do this. Which are both more efficient and secure. However doing things that way would but a bit of a major hole in what MicroSoft's 'telemetry' can more covertly get it's hands on.</p>

<p>I'm confused about this. Wasn't DOUBLEPULSAR a malware implant - NOT a vulnerability? Did Huawei drivers come with an implant?</p>

<p>Also, "believed to be the Russian Government" - I've seen this opinion on primarily this blog and some forums but I've also run into lots of other theories and nothing - so far - close to conclusive. The blog post makes it sound like there's a good consensus in the community. Has more definitive information come out?</p>

<p>OT, but</p>

<p>The United States have been trying hard to discredit chinese manufacturers, starting with Lenovo years ago.  There had been a high pressure from the U.S. against European Union countries on this matter recently.</p>

<p>May it be a false flag operation against Huawei customers?</p>

<p>I would not discard a non-appropriately protected development server at Huawei being attacked to introduce this code.</p>

money, power, position, economical edge, shutting down the opposition etc, you name it.</p>

<p>@1&1~=Umm re: "...by whom and under what chain of authority." Ex-freaking-xactly.<br />
BTW, this being April 1, I note that many entities evidently still observe April Fools Day, and I wonder if there remains any real point in doing so. IMO - on the internet, every day is April Fools...</p>

<p>How the heck does a vulnerability get put in accidentally?  I can understand the Chicoms wanting a backdoor access to routers which makes a claim of "Opps! It was an accident" even less believable.<br />

	    <p>Yet another side-channel attack on smartphones: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11137">Hearing your touch: A new acoustic side channel on smartphones</a>," by Ilia Shumailov, Laurent Simon, Jeff Yan, and Ross Anderson.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present the first acoustic side-channel attack that recovers what users type on the virtual keyboard of their touch-screen smartphone or tablet. When a user taps the screen with a finger, the tap generates a sound wave that propagates on the screen surface and in the air. We found the device's microphone(s) can recover this wave and "hear" the finger's touch, and the wave's distortions are characteristic of the tap's location on the screen. Hence, by recording audio through the built-in microphone(s), a malicious app can infer text as the user enters it on their device. We evaluate the effectiveness of the attack with 45 participants in a real-world environment on an Android tablet and an Android smartphone. For the tablet, we recover 61% of 200 4-digit PIN-codes within 20 attempts, even if the model is not trained with the victim's data. For the smartphone, we recover 9 words of size 7-13 letters with 50 attempts in a common side-channel attack benchmark. Our results suggest that it not always sufficient to rely on isolation mechanisms such as TrustZone to protect user input. We propose and discuss hardware, operating-system and application-level mechanisms to block this attack more effectively. Mobile devices may need a richer capability model, a more user-friendly notification system for sensor usage and a more thorough evaluation of the information leaked by the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011237"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/07/hacking_a_segwa.html">Hacking a Segway</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>The Segway has a mobile app. It is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/segway-minipro-hack/">hackable</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>While analyzing the communication between the app and the Segway scooter itself, Kilbride noticed that a user PIN number meant to protect the Bluetooth communication from unauthorized access wasn't being used for authentication at every level of the system. As a result, Kilbride could send arbitrary commands to the scooter without needing the user-chosen PIN.

<p>He also discovered that the hoverboard's software update platform didn't have a mechanism in place to confirm that firmware updates sent to the device were really from Segway (often called an "integrity check"). This meant that in addition to sending the scooter commands, an attacker could easily trick the device into installing a malicious firmware update that could override its fundamental programming. In this way an attacker would be able to nullify built-in safety mechanisms that prevented the app from remote-controlling or shutting off the vehicle while someone was on it.</p>

<p>"The app allows you to do things like change LED colors, it allows you to remote-control the hoverboard and also apply firmware updates, which is the interesting part," Kilbride says. "Under the right circumstances, if somebody applies a malicious firmware update, any attacker who knows the right assembly language could then leverage this to basically do as they wish with the hoverboard."</p></blockquote>

	    <p><a href="https://www.benthamsgaze.org/2015/12/01/forced-authorisation-chip-and-pin-hitting-high-end-retailers/">Clever</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The way forced authorisation fraud works is that the retailer sets up the terminal for a transaction by inserting the customer's card and entering the amount, then hands the terminal over to the customer so they can type in the PIN. But the criminal has used a stolen or counterfeit card, and due to the high value of the transaction the terminal performs a "referral" -- asking the retailer to call the bank to perform additional checks such as the customer answering a security question. If the security checks pass, the bank will give the retailer an authorisation code to enter into the terminal.

<p>The problem is that when the terminal asks for these security checks, it's still in the hands of the criminal, and it's the criminal that follows the steps that the retailer should have. Since there's no phone conversation with the bank, the criminal doesn't know the correct authorisation code. But what surprises retailers is that the criminal can type in anything at this stage and the transaction will go through. The criminal might also be able to bypass other security features, for example they could override the checking of the PIN by following the steps the retailer would if the customer has forgotten the PIN.</p>

<p>By the time the terminal is passed back to the retailer, it looks like the transaction was completed successfully. The receipt will differ only very subtly from that of a normal transaction, if at all. The criminal walks off with the goods and it's only at the end of the day that the authorisation code is checked by the bank. By that time, the criminal is long gone. Because some of the security checks the bank asked for weren't completed, the retailer doesn't get the money.</p></blockquote>

	    <p><a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/03/17/black-box-brouhaha-breaks-out-over-brute-forcing-of-iphone-pin-lock/">This</a> is a clever attack, using a black box that attaches to the iPhone via USB:</p>

<blockquote><p>As you know, an iPhone keeps a count of how many wrong PINs have been entered, in case you have turned on the <tt>Erase Data</tt> option on the <tt>Settings | Touch ID & Passcode</tt> screen.

<p>That's a highly-recommended option, because it wipes your device after 10 passcode mistakes.</p>

<p>Even if you only set a 4-digit PIN, that gives a crook who steals your phone just a 10 in 10,000 chance, or 0.1%, of guessing your unlock code in time.</p>

<p>But this Black Box has a trick up its cable.</p>

<p>Apparently, the device uses a light sensor to work out, from the change in screen intensity, when it has got the right PIN.</p>

<p>In other words, it also knows when it gets the PIN wrong, as it will most of the time, so it can kill the power to your iPhone when that happens.</p>

<p>And the power-down happens quickly enough (it seems you need to open up the iPhone and bypass the battery so you can power the device entirely via the USB cable) that your iPhone doesn't have time to subtract one from the "PIN guesses remaining" counter stored on the device. </p></blockquote>

<p>Because every set of wrong guesses requires a reboot, the process takes about five days. Still, a very clever attack.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a005366"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/06/security_risks_.html">Security Risks from Remote-Controlled Smart Devices</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>We're starting to see a proliferation of smart devices that can be controlled from your phone.  The security risk is, of course, that <i>anyone</i> can control them from their phones.  Like this Japanese <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23575249">smart toilet</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The toilet, manufactured by Japanese firm Lixil, is controlled via an Android app called My Satis.

<p>But a hardware flaw means any phone with the app could activate any of the toilets, researchers say.</p>

<p>The toilet uses bluetooth to receive instructions via the app, but the Pin code for every model is hardwired to be four zeros (0000), meaning that it cannot be reset and can be activated by any phone with the My Satis app, a report by Trustwave's Spiderlabs information security experts reveals.</p></blockquote>

<p>This particular attack requires Bluetooth connectivity and doesn't work over the Internet, but many other similar attacks will.  And because these devices send to have their code in firmware, a lot of them <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-468.html">won't be patchable</a>.  My guess is that the toilet's manufacturer will ignore it.</p>

<p>On the other end of your home, a smart TV protocol is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27761756">vulnerable</a> to attack:</p>

<blockquote><p>The attack uses the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) standard that is widely supported in smart television sets sold in Europe.

<p>The HbbTV system was designed to help broadcasters exploit the internet connection of a smart TV to add extra information to programmes or so advertisers can do a better job of targeting viewers.</p>

<p>But Yossef Oren and Angelos Keromytis, from the Network Security Lab, at Columbia University, have found a way to hijack HbbTV using a cheap antenna and carefully crafted broadcast messages.</p></blockquote>

<p>The attacker could impersonate the user to the TV provider, websites, and so on.  This attack also doesn't use the Internet, but instead a nearby antenna. And in this case, we know that the manufacturers are going to ignore it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr Oren said the standards body that oversaw HbbTV had been told about the security loophole. However, he added, the body did not think the threat from the attack was serious enough to require a re-write of the technology's security.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>"<a href="http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~aviv/papers/aviv-acsac12-accel.pdf">Practicality of Accelerometer Side Channels on Smartphones</a>," by Adam J. Aviv. Benjamin Sapp, Matt Blaze, and Jonathan M. Smith.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>:  Modern smartphones are equipped with a plethora of sensors that enable a wide range of interactions, but some of these sensors can be employed as a side channel to surreptitiously learn about user input. In this paper, we show that the accelerometer sensor can also be employed as a high-bandwidth side channel; particularly, we demonstrate how to use the accelerometer sensor to learn user tap and gesture-based input as required to unlock smartphones using a PIN/password or Android's graphical password pattern. Using data collected from a diverse group of 24 users in controlled (while sitting) and uncontrolled (while walking) settings, we develop sample rate independent features for accelerometer readings based on signal processing and polynomial fitting techniques. In controlled settings, our prediction model can on average classify the PIN entered 43% of the time and pattern 73% of the time within 5 attempts when selecting from a test set of 50 PINs and 50 patterns. In uncontrolled settings, while users are walking, our model can still classify 20% of the PINs and 40% of the patterns within 5 attempts. We additionally explore the possibility of constructing an accelerometer-reading-to-input dictionary and find that such dictionaries would be greatly challenged by movement-noise and cross-user training.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a004478"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/08/is_iphone_secur.html">Is iPhone Security Really this Good?</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Simson Garfinkel <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428477/the-iphone-has-passed-a-key-security-threshold/">writes</a> that the iPhone has such good security that the police can't use it for forensics anymore:</p>

<blockquote><p>Technologies the company has adopted protect Apple customers' content so well that in many situations it's impossible for law enforcement to perform forensic examinations of devices seized from criminals. Most significant is the increasing use of encryption, which is beginning to cause problems for law enforcement agencies when they encounter systems with encrypted drives.

<p>"I can tell you from the Department of Justice perspective, if that drive is encrypted, you're done," Ovie Carroll, director of the cyber-crime lab at the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section in the Department of Justice, said during his keynote address at the DFRWS computer forensics conference in Washington, D.C., last Monday. "When conducting criminal investigations, if you pull the power on a drive that is whole-disk encrypted you have lost any chance of recovering that data."</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, I believe that full-disk encryption -- whether Apple's FileVault or Microsoft's BitLocker (I don't know what the iOS system is called) -- is good; but its security is only as good as the user is at choosing a good password.</p>

<blockquote><p>The iPhone always supported a PIN lock, but the PIN wasn't a deterrent to a serious attacker <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4175">until the iPhone 3GS</a>. Because those early phones didn't use their hardware to perform encryption, a skilled investigator could hack into the phone, dump its flash memory, and directly access the phone's address book, e-mail messages, and other information. But now, with Apple's more sophisticated approach to encryption, investigators who want to examine data on a phone have to try every possible PIN. Examiners perform these so-called brute-force attacks with special software, because the iPhone can be programmed to wipe itself if the wrong PIN is provided more than 10 times in a row. This software must be run on the iPhone itself, limiting the guessing speed to 80 milliseconds per PIN. Trying all four-digit PINs therefore requires no more than 800 seconds, a little more than 13 minutes. However, if the user chooses a six-digit PIN, the maximum time required would be 22 hours; a nine-digit PIN would require 2.5 years, and a 10-digit pin would take 25 years. That's good enough for most corporate secretsâand probably good enough for most criminals as well. </p></blockquote>

<p>Leaving aside the user practice questions -- my guess is that very few users, even those with something to hide, use a ten-digit PIN -- could this possibly be true?  In the introduction to <a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-applied.html"><i>Applied Cryptography</i></a>, almost 20 years ago, I wrote: "There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography that will stop your kid sister from reading your files, and cryptography that will stop major governments from reading your files."</p>

<p>Since then, I've learned two things: 1) there are a lot of gradients to kid sister cryptography, and 2) major government cryptography is very hard to get right.  It's not the cryptography; it's everything around the cryptography.  I said as much in the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-sandl.html">preface</a> to <i>Secrets and Lies</i></a> in 2000:</p>

<blockquote><p>Cryptography is a branch of mathematics. And like all mathematics, it involves numbers, equations, and logic. Security, palpable security that you or I might find useful in our lives, involves people: things people know, relationships between people, people and how they relate to machines. Digital security involves computers: complex, unstable, buggy computers.

<p>Mathematics is perfect; reality is subjective. Mathematics is defined; computers are ornery. Mathematics is logical; people are erratic, capricious, and barely comprehensible.</p></blockquote>

<p>If, in fact, we've finally achieved something resembling this level of security for our computers and handheld computing devices, this is something to celebrate.</p>

<p>But I'm skeptical.</p>

<blockquote><p>When you pay a restaurant bill at your table using a point-of-sale machine, are you sure it's legit? In the past three months, Toronto and Peel police have discovered many that aren't.

<p>In what is the latest financial fraud, crooks are using distraction techniques to replace merchants' machines with their own, police say. At the end of the day, they create another distraction to pull the switch again.</p>

<p>Using information inputted by customers, including PIN data, the criminals are reproducing credit cards at an alarming rate.</p></blockquote>

<p>Presumably these hacked point-of-sale terminals look and function normally, and additionally save a copy of the credit card information.</p>

<p>Note that this attack works despite any customer-focused security, like chip-and-pin systems.</p>

	    <p>Research paper:  "<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jcb82/doc/BPA12-FC-banking_pin_security.pdf">A birthday present every eleven wallets? The security of customer-chosen banking PINs</a>," by Joseph Bonneau, S&ouml;ren Preibusch, and Ross Anderson:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>:  We provide the first published estimates of the difficulty of guessing a human-chosen 4-digit PIN. We begin with two large sets of 4-digit sequences chosen outside banking for online passwords and smartphone unlock-codes. We use a regression model to identify a small number of dominant factors influencing user choice. Using this model and a survey of over 1,100 banking customers, we estimate the distribution of banking PINs as well as the frequency of security-relevant behaviour such as sharing and reusing PINs. We find that guessing PINs based on the victims' birthday, which nearly all users carry documentation of, will enable a competent thief to gain use of an ATM card once for every 11-18 stolen wallets, depending on whether banks prohibit weak PINs such as 1234. The lesson for cardholders is to never use one's date of birth as a PIN. The lesson for card-issuing banks is to implement a denied PIN list, which several large banks still fail to do. However, blacklists cannot effectively mitigate guessing given a known birth date, suggesting banks should move away from customer-chosen banking PINs in the long term.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>After years of claiming that the Terrorist Screening Database is kept secret within the government, we have <a href="https://wtop.com/government/2019/02/apnewsbreak-feds-share-watchlist-with-1400-private-groups/">now learned</a> that the DHS shares it "with more than 1,400 private entities, including hospitals and universities...." </p>

<blockquote><p>Critics say that the watchlist is wildly overbroad and mismanaged, and that large numbers of people wrongly included on the list suffer routine difficulties and indignities because of their inclusion.

<p>The government's admission comes in a class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in Alexandria by Muslims who say they regularly experience difficulties in travel, financial transactions and interactions with law enforcement because they have been wrongly added to the list.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course that is the effect.</p>

<p>We need more transparency into this process. People need a way to challenge their inclusion on the list, and a redress process if they are being falsely accused.</p>

<blockquote><p>It was only after Hasson's arrest last Friday at his workplace that the chilling plans prosecutors assert he was crafting became apparent, detected by an internal Coast Guard program that watches for any "insider threat."

<p>The program identified suspicious computer activity tied to Hasson, prompting the agency's investigative service to launch an investigation last fall, said Lt. Cmdr. Scott McBride, a service spokesman.</p></blockquote>

<p>Any detection system of this kind is going to have to balance false positives with false negatives. Could it be something as simple as visiting right-wing extremist websites or watching their videos? It just has to be something more sophisticated than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/new-york-police-terrorism-pressure-cooker">researching pressure cookers</a>. I'm glad that Hasson was arrested before he killed anyone rather than after, but I worry that these systems are basically creating <a href="https://www.planetebook.com/free-ebooks/1984.pdf">thoughtcrime</a>.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011845"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/11/what_happened_t.html">What Happened to Cyber 9/11?</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>A <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/11/terrorist-cyberattack-midterm-elections/574504/">recent article</a> in the <i>Atlantic</i> asks why we haven't seen a"cyber 9/11" in the past fifteen or so years. (I, too, remember the increasingly frantic and fearful warnings of a "cyber Peal Harbor," "cyber Katrina" -- when that was a thing -- or "cyber 9/11."  I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/07/threat_of_cyberwar_h.html">made</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/stoking_cyber_f.html">fun</a> of those warnings back then.) The author's answer:</p>

<blockquote><p>Three main barriers are likely preventing this. For one, cyberattacks can lack the kind of drama and immediate physical carnage that terrorists seek. Identifying the specific perpetrator of a cyberattack can also be difficult, meaning terrorists might have trouble reaping the propaganda benefits of clear attribution. Finally, and most simply, it's possible that they just can't pull it off.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/11/why-no-cyber-911-for-15-years.html">Commenting</a> on the article, Rob Graham adds:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think there are lots of warning from so-called "experts" who aren't qualified to make such warnings, that the press errs on the side of giving such warnings credibility instead of challenging them.

<p>I think mostly the reason why cyberterrorism doesn't happen is that which motivates violent people is different than what which motivates technical people, pulling apart the groups who would want to commit cyberterrorism from those who can.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are all good reasons, but I think both authors missed the most important one: there simply aren't a lot of terrorists out there. Let's ask the question more generally: why hasn't there been another 9/11 since 2001? I also remember dire predictions that large-scale terrorism was the new normal, and that we would see 9/11-scale attacks regularly. But since then, nothing. We could credit the fantastic counterterrorism work of the US and other countries, but a more reasonable explanation is that there are very few terrorists and even fewer organized ones. Our fear of terrorism is <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2006-09-01/there-still-terrorist-threat-myth-omnipresent-enemy">far greater</a> than the actual risk.</p>

<p>This isn't to say that cyberterrorism can never happen. Of course it will, sooner or later. But I don't foresee it becoming a preferred terrorism method anytime soon. Graham again:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the end, if your goal is to cause major power blackouts, your best bet is to bomb power lines and distribution centers, rather than hack them.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Interesting <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-l-a-s-anti-terrorist-subway-scanners-be-adopted-everywhere/">article</a> on terahertz millimeter-wave scanners and their uses to detect terrorist bombers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The heart of the device is a block of electronics about the size of a 1990s tower personal computer. It comes housed in a musician's black case, akin to the one Spinal Tap might use on tour. At the front: a large, square white plate, the terahertz camera and, just above it, an ordinary closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera. Mounted on a shelf inside the case is a laptop that displays the CCTV image and the blobby terahertz image side by side.

<p>An operator compares the two images as people flow past, looking for unexplained dark areas that could represent firearms or suicide vests. Most images that might be mistaken for a weaponÂ­ -- backpacks or a big patch of sweat on the back of a person's shirtÂ­ -- are easily evaluated by observing the terahertz image alongside an unaltered video picture of the passenger.</p>

<p>It is up to the operatorÂ­ -- in LA's case, presumably a transport police officerÂ­ -- to query people when dark areas on the terahertz image suggest concealed large weapons or suicide vests. The device cannot see inside bodies, backpacks or shoes. "If you look at previous incidents on public transit systems, this technology would have detected those," Sotero says, noting LA Metro worked "closely" with the TSA for over a year to test this and other technologies. "It definitely has the backing of TSA."</p>

<p>How the technology works in practice depends heavily on the operator's training. According to Evans, "A lot of tradecraft goes into understanding where the threat item is likely to be on the body." He sees the crucial role played by the operator as giving back control to security guards and allowing them to use their common sense.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am quoted in the article as being skeptical of the technology, particularly how its deployed.</p>

	    <p>Another excellent paper by the Mueller/Stewart team: "<a href="https://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/bathtubs8APSA.pdf">Terrorism and Bathtubs: Comparing and Assessing the Risks</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The likelihood that anyone outside a war zone will be killed by an Islamist extremist terrorist is extremely small. In the United States, for example, some six people have perished each year since 9/11 at the hands of such terrorists -- vastly smaller than the number of people who die in bathtub drownings. Some argue, however, that the incidence of terrorist destruction is low because counterterrorism measures are so effective. They also contend that terrorism may well become more frequent and destructive in the future as terrorists plot and plan and learn from experience, and that terrorism, unlike bathtubs, provides no benefit and exacts costs far beyond those in the event itself by damagingly sowing fear and anxiety and by requiring policy makers to adopt countermeasures that are costly and excessive. This paper finds these arguments to be wanting. In the process, it concludes that terrorism is rare outside war zones because, to a substantial degree, terrorists don't exist there. In general, as with rare diseases that kill few, it makes more policy sense to expend limited funds on hazards that inflict far more damage. It also discusses the issue of risk communication for this hazard.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011678"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/08/dont_fear_the_t.html">Don't Fear the TSA Cutting Airport Security. Be Glad That They're Talking about It.</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Last week, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/tsa-considering-eliminating-screening-at-smaller-airports/index.html">CNN reported</a> that the Transportation Security Administration is considering eliminating security at U.S. airports that fly only smaller planes -- 60 seats or fewer. Passengers connecting to larger planes would clear security at their destinations.</p>

<p>To be clear, the TSA has put forth no concrete proposal. The internal agency working group's report obtained by CNN contains no recommendations. It's nothing more than 20 people examining the potential security risks of the policy change. It's not even new: The TSA considered this back in 2011, and the agency reviews its security policies every year. But commentary around the news has been <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/02/politics/tsa-airport-security/index.html">strongly negative</a>. Regardless of the idea's merit, it will almost certainly not happen. That's the result of politics, not security: Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of numerous outraged lawmakers, has already penned a letter to the agency saying that "TSA documents proposing to scrap critical passenger security screenings, without so much as a metal detector in place in some airports, would effectively clear the runway for potential terrorist attacks." He continued, "It simply boggles the mind to even think that the TSA has plans like this on paper in the first place."</p>

<p>We don't know enough to conclude whether this is a good idea, but it shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. We need to evaluate airport security based on concrete costs and benefits, and not continue to implement <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/beyond_fear/">security theater</a> based on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/01/stop_the_panic_on_ai.html">fear</a>. And we should applaud the agency's willingness to explore changes in the screening process.</p>

<p>There is already a tiered system for airport security, varying for both airports and passengers. Many people are enrolled in TSA PreCheck, allowing them to go through checkpoints faster and with less screening. Smaller airports don't have modern screening equipment like full-body scanners or CT baggage screeners, making it impossible for them to detect some plastic explosives. Any would-be terrorist is already able to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/01/profiling_makes_us_l.html">pick and choose</a> his flight conditions to suit his plot.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/12/why_the_tsa_cant_bac.html">written</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/11/a_waste_of_money_and.html">many</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2015/06/why_are_we_spending_.html">essays</a> critical of the TSA and airport security, in general. Most of it is security theater -- measures that make us feel safer without improving security. For example, the liquids ban makes no sense as implemented, because there's <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/10/time_to_show_bottle.html">no penalty for repeatedly trying</a> to evade the scanners. The full-body scanners are <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/12/hiding_petn_fro.html">terrible</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/german_tv_on_th.html">at</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/12/why_the_tsa_cant_bac.html">detecting</a> the explosive material PETN if it is well concealed -- which is their whole point.</p>

<p>There are two basic kinds of terrorists. The amateurs will be deterred or detected by even basic security measures. The professionals will figure out how to evade even the most stringent measures. I've <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/11/the-things-he-carried/307057/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/harms_of_post-9.html">said</a> that the two things that have made flying safer since 9/11 are reinforcing the cockpit doors and persuading passengers that they need to fight back. Everything beyond that isn't worth it.</p>

<p>It's always possible to increase security by adding more onerous -- and expensive -- procedures. If that were the only concern, we would all be strip-searched and prohibited from traveling with luggage. Realistically, we need to analyze whether the increased security of any measure is worth the cost, in money, time and convenience. We <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/21/tsa-spending-3-d-scanners/447410002/">spend $8 billion a year</a> on the TSA, and we'd like to get the most security possible for that money.</p>

<p>This is exactly what that TSA working group was doing. CNN <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/tsa-considering-eliminating-screening-at-smaller-airports/index.html">reported</a> that the group specifically evaluated the costs and benefits of eliminating security at minor airports, saving $115 million a year with a "small (nonzero) undesirable increase in risk related to additional adversary opportunity." That money could be used to bolster security at larger airports or to reduce threats totally removed from airports.</p>

<p>We need more of this kind of thinking, not less. In 2017, political scientists Mark Stewart and John Mueller published a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Are-Safe-Enough-Measuring-Assessing/dp/0128114754/">detailed evaluation</a> of airport security measures based on the cost to implement and the benefit in terms of lives saved. They concluded that most of what our government does either isn't effective at preventing terrorism or is simply too expensive to justify the security it does provide. Others might disagree with their conclusions, but their analysis provides enough detailed information to have a meaningful argument.</p>

<p>The more we politicize security, the worse we are. People are generally <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/05/psychology_of_securi.html">terrible</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/03/why_the_human_brain.html">judges</a> of risk. We fear threats in the news <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2012/07/drawing_the_wrong_le.html">out of proportion</a> with the actual dangers. We overestimate rare and spectacular risks, and underestimate commonplace ones. We fear specific "<a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2005/09/terrorists_dont_do_m.html">movie-plot threats</a>" that we can bring to mind. That's why we fear flying over driving, even though the latter kills about 35,000 people each year -- about a 9/11's worth of deaths each month. And it's why the idea of the TSA eliminating security at minor airports fills us with fear. We can imagine the plot unfolding, only without Bruce Willis saving the day.</p>

<p>Very little today is immune to politics, including the TSA. It drove most of the agency's decisions in the early years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That the TSA is willing to consider politically unpopular ideas is a credit to the organization. Let's let them perform their analyses in peace.</p>

	    <p>Local residents are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/nyregion/subway-elevators-disabled-terrorism.html">opposing</a> adding an elevator to a subway station because terrorists might use it to detonate a bomb. No, really. There's no actual threat analysis, only fear:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The idea that people can then ride in on the subway with a bomb or whatever and come straight up in an elevator is awful to me," said Claudia Ward, who lives in 15 Broad Street and was among a group of neighbors who denounced the plan at a recent meeting of the local community board. "It's too easy for someone to slip through. And I just don't want my family and my neighbors to be the collateral on that."

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Local residents plan to continue to fight, said Ms. Gerstman, noting that her building's board decided against putting decorative planters at the building's entrance over fears that shards could injure people in the event of a blast.</p>

<p>"Knowing that, and then seeing the proposal for giant glass structures in front of my building Â­- ding ding ding! -- what does a giant glass structure become in the event of an explosion?" she said.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 2005, I <a href="https://www.wired.com/2005/09/terrorists-dont-do-movie-plots/">coined the term</a> "movie-plot threat" to denote a threat scenario that caused undue fear solely because of its specificity. Longtime readers of this blog will remember my annual Movie-Plot Threat Contests. I ended the contest in 2015 because I thought the meme had played itself out. Clearly there's more work to be done.</p>

	    <p>Fascinating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/13/the-scientists-persuading-terrorists-to-spill-their-secrets">article</a> about two psychologists who are studying interrogation techniques.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, two British researchers are quietly revolutionising the study and practice of interrogation. Earlier this year, in a meeting room at the University of Liverpool, I watched a video of the Diola interview alongside Laurence Alison, the university's chair of forensic psychology, and Emily Alison, a professional counsellor. My permission to view the tape was negotiated with the counter-terrorist police, who are understandably wary of allowing outsiders access to such material. Details of the interview have been changed to protect the identity of the officers involved, though the quotes are verbatim.

<p>The Alisons, husband and wife, have done something no scholars of interrogation have been able to do before. Working in close cooperation with the police, who allowed them access to more than 1,000 hours of tapes, they have observed and analysed hundreds of real-world interviews with terrorists suspected of serious crimes. No researcher in the world has ever laid hands on such a haul of data before. Based on this research, they have constructed the world's first empirically grounded and comprehensive model of interrogation tactics.</p>

<p>The Alisons' findings are changing the way law enforcement and security agencies approach the delicate and vital task of gathering human intelligence. "I get very little, if any, pushback from practitioners when I present the Alisons' work," said Kleinman, who now teaches interrogation tactics to military and police officers. "Even those who don't have a clue about the scientific method, it just resonates with them." The Alisons have done more than strengthen the hand of advocates of non-coercive interviewing: they have provided an unprecedentedly authoritative account of what works and what does not, rooted in a profound understanding of human relations. That they have been able to do so is testament to a joint preoccupation with police interviews that stretches back more than 20 years.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Interesting research from <i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>: "<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3">The devoted actor's will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Frontline investigations with fighters against the Islamic State (ISIL or ISIS), combined with multiple online studies, address willingness to fight and die in intergroup conflict. The general focus is on non-utilitarian aspects of human conflict, which combatants themselves deem 'sacred' or 'spiritual', whether secular or religious. Here we investigate two key components of a theoretical framework we call 'the devoted actor' -- sacred values and identity fusion with a groupÂ­ -- to better understand people's willingness to make costly sacrifices. We reveal three crucial factors: commitment to non-negotiable sacred values and the groups that the actors are wholly fused with; readiness to forsake kin for those values; and perceived spiritual strength of ingroup versus foes as more important than relative material strength. We directly relate expressed willingness for action to behaviour as a check on claims that decisions in extreme conflicts are driven by cost-benefit calculations, which may help to inform policy decisions for the common defense. </p></blockquote>

	    <p>On Aug. 16, two men were escorted off a plane headed for Manchester, England, because some passengers thought they looked either Asian or Middle Eastern, might have been talking Arabic, wore leather jackets, and looked at their watches -- and the passengers refused to fly with them on board.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=401419&amp;in_page_id=1770">The men</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/5267884.stm">were questioned</a> for several hours and then released.</p>
<p>On Aug. 15, an entire airport terminal was evacuated because someone's cosmetics <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/17/national/main1906433.shtml">triggered</a> a false positive for explosives. The same day, a Muslim man was <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/08/18/doctor-winnipeg.html">removed</a> from an airplane in Denver for reciting prayers. The Transportation Security Administration decided that the flight crew overreacted, but he still had to spend the night in Denver before flying home the next day.</p>
<p>The next day, a Port of Seattle terminal was evacuated because a couple of dogs gave a <a href="http://www.heraldnet.com/stories/06/08/16/100wir_port1.cfm">false alarm</a> for explosives.</p>
<p>On Aug. 19, a plane made an <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/local/states/florida/counties/broward_county/15321870.htm">emergency landing</a> in Tampa, Florida, after the crew became suspicious because two of the lavatory doors were locked. The plane was searched, but nothing was found. Meanwhile, a man who tampered with a bathroom smoke detector on a flight to San Antonio was <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-08-20-fbi-passenger_x.htm">cleared</a> of terrorism, but only after having his house searched.</p>
<p>On Aug. 16, a woman suffered a panic attack and became violent on a flight from London to Washington, so the plane was <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/08/17/1155407916156.html">escorted</a> to the Boston airport by fighter jets. "The woman was carrying hand cream and matches but was not a terrorist threat," said the TSA spokesman after the incident.</p>
<p>And on Aug. 18, a plane flying from London to Egypt made an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-6024132,00.html">emergency landing</a> in Italy when someone found a bomb threat scrawled on an air sickness bag. Nothing was found on the plane, and no one knows how long the note was on board.</p>
<p>I'd like everyone to take a deep breath and listen for a minute.</p>
<p>The point of terrorism is to cause terror, sometimes to further a political goal and sometimes out of sheer hatred. The people terrorists kill are not the targets; they are collateral damage. And blowing up planes, trains, markets or buses is not the goal; those are just tactics.</p>
<p>The real targets of terrorism are the rest of us: the billions of us who are not killed but are terrorized because of the killing. The real point of terrorism is not the act itself, but our reaction to the act.</p>
<p>And we're doing exactly what the terrorists want.</p>
<p>We're all a little jumpy after the recent arrest of 23 terror suspects in Great Britain. The men were reportedly plotting a liquid-explosive attack on airplanes, and both the press and politicians have been trumpeting the story ever since.</p>
<p>In truth, it's doubtful that their plan would have succeeded; <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/17/flying_toilet_terror_labs/print.html">chemists</a> <a href="http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200608/msg00087.html">have</a> <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/14/tatp_about_that_pyro.html">been</a> <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2306994,00.html">debunking</a> the idea since it became public. Certainly the suspects were <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/10/us.security/index.html">a long way off</a> from trying: None had bought airline tickets, and some didn't even have passports.</p>
<p>Regardless of the threat, from the would-be bombers' perspective, the explosives and planes were merely tactics. Their goal was to cause terror, and in that they've succeeded.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment what would have happened if they had blown up 10 planes. There would be canceled flights, chaos at airports, bans on carry-on luggage, world leaders talking tough new security measures, political posturing and all sorts of false alarms as jittery people panicked. To a lesser degree, that's basically what's happening right now.</p>
<p>Our politicians help the terrorists every time they use fear as a campaign tactic. The press helps every time it writes scare stories about the plot and the threat. And if we're terrified, and we share that fear, we help. All of these actions intensify and repeat the terrorists' actions, and increase the effects of their terror.</p>
<p>(I am not saying that the politicians and press are terrorists, or that they share any of the blame for terrorist attacks. I'm not that stupid. But the subject of terrorism is more complex than it appears, and understanding its various causes and effects are vital for understanding how to best deal with it.)</p>
<p>The implausible plots and false alarms actually hurt us in two ways. Not only do they increase the level of fear, but they also waste time and resources that could be better spent fighting the real threats and increasing actual security. I'll bet the terrorists are <a href="http://www.wondermark.com/d/220.html">laughing at us</a>.</p>
<p>Another thought experiment: Imagine for a moment that the British government arrested the 23 suspects without fanfare. Imagine that the TSA and its European counterparts didn't engage in <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-096.html">pointless</a> airline-security measures like banning liquids. And imagine that the press didn't write about it endlessly, and that the politicians didn't use the event to remind us all how scared we should be. If we'd reacted that way, then the terrorists would have truly failed.</p>
<p>It's time we calm down and fight terror with antiterror. This does not mean that we simply roll over and accept terrorism. There are things our government <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-038.html">can and should</a> do to fight terrorism, most of them <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/terrorism_secur.html">involving</a> intelligence and investigation -- and not focusing on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-087.html">specific plots</a>.</p>
<p>But our job is to remain steadfast in the face of terror, to <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/08/17/airport_futility/">refuse to be terrorized</a>. Our job is to <a href="http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2006/08/wait-arent-you-scared.html">not panic</a> every time two Muslims stand together checking their watches. There are approximately 1 billion Muslims in the world, a large percentage of them not Arab, and about 320 million Arabs in the Middle East, the overwhelming majority of them not terrorists. Our job is to think critically and rationally, and to ignore the cacophony of other interests trying to use terrorism to advance political careers or increase a television show's viewership.</p>
<p>The surest defense against terrorism is to refuse to be terrorized. Our job is to recognize that terrorism is just one of the risks we face, and not a particularly common one at that. And our job is to fight those politicians who use fear as an excuse to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-045.html">take away</a> our liberties and promote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater">security theater</a> that wastes money and doesn't make us any safer.</p>

	    <p>Yet another side-channel attack on smartphones: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11137">Hearing your touch: A new acoustic side channel on smartphones</a>," by Ilia Shumailov, Laurent Simon, Jeff Yan, and Ross Anderson.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present the first acoustic side-channel attack that recovers what users type on the virtual keyboard of their touch-screen smartphone or tablet. When a user taps the screen with a finger, the tap generates a sound wave that propagates on the screen surface and in the air. We found the device's microphone(s) can recover this wave and "hear" the finger's touch, and the wave's distortions are characteristic of the tap's location on the screen. Hence, by recording audio through the built-in microphone(s), a malicious app can infer text as the user enters it on their device. We evaluate the effectiveness of the attack with 45 participants in a real-world environment on an Android tablet and an Android smartphone. For the tablet, we recover 61% of 200 4-digit PIN-codes within 20 attempts, even if the model is not trained with the victim's data. For the smartphone, we recover 9 words of size 7-13 letters with 50 attempts in a common side-channel attack benchmark. Our results suggest that it not always sufficient to rely on isolation mechanisms such as TrustZone to protect user input. We propose and discuss hardware, operating-system and application-level mechanisms to block this attack more effectively. Mobile devices may need a richer capability model, a more user-friendly notification system for sensor usage and a more thorough evaluation of the information leaked by the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>It's amazing that this is even possible: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10250">SonarSnoop: Active Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We report the first active acoustic side-channel attack. Speakers are used to emit human inaudible acoustic signals and the echo is recorded via microphones, turning the acoustic system of a smart phone into a sonar system. The echo signal can be used to profile user interaction with the device. For example, a victim's finger movements can be inferred to steal Android phone unlock patterns. In our empirical study, the number of candidate unlock patterns that an attacker must try to authenticate herself to a Samsung S4 Android phone can be reduced by up to 70% using this novel acoustic side-channel. Our approach can be easily applied to other application scenarios and device types. Overall, our work highlights a new family of security threats.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011687"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/08/speculation_att.html">Speculation Attack Against Intel's SGX</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Another <a href="https://foreshadowattack.eu/">speculative-execution attack</a> against Intel's SGX.</p>

<blockquote><p>At a high level, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">SGX</a> is a new feature in modern Intel CPUs which allows computers to protect users' data even if the entire system falls under the attacker's control. While it was previously believed that SGX is resilient to speculative execution attacks (such as <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre</a>), Foreshadow demonstrates how speculative execution can be exploited for reading the contents of SGX-protected memory as well as extracting the machine's private attestation key. Making things worse, due to SGX's privacy features, an attestation report cannot be linked to the identity of its signer. Thus, it only takes a single compromised SGX machine to erode trust in the entire SGX ecosystem.</p></blockquote>

<p>News <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/08/intels-sgx-blown-wide-open-by-you-guessed-it-a-speculative-execution-attack/">article</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The details of the Foreshadow attack are a little more complicated than those of Meltdown. In Meltdown, the attempt to perform an illegal read of kernel memory triggers the page fault mechanism (by which the processor and operating system cooperate to determine which bit of physical memory a memory access corresponds to, or they crash the program if there's no such mapping). Attempts to read SGX data from outside an enclave receive special handling by the processor: reads always return a specific value (-1), and writes are ignored completely. The special handling is called "abort page semantics" and should be enough to prevent speculative reads from being able to learn anything.

<p>However, the Foreshadow researchers found a way to bypass the abort page semantics. The data structures used to control the mapping of virtual-memory addresses to physical addresses include a flag to say whether a piece of memory is present (loaded into RAM somewhere) or not. If memory is marked as not being present at all, the processor stops performing any further permissions checks and immediately triggers the page fault mechanism: this means that the abort page mechanics aren't used. It turns out that applications can mark memory, including enclave memory, as not being present by removing all permissions (read, write, execute) from that memory.</p></blockquote>

<p>EDITED TO ADD: Intel has <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3298157/linux/linux-and-l1tf.html">responded</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>L1 Terminal Fault is addressed by microcode updates released earlier this year, coupled with corresponding updates to operating system and hypervisor software that are available starting today. We've provided more information on our web site and continue to encourage everyone to keep their systems up-to-date, as it's one of the best ways to stay protected.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/protecting-our-customers-through-lifecycle-security-threats/">this</a> is the "more information" they're referring to, although <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/protecting-our-customers-through-lifecycle-security-threats/">this</a> is a comprehensive link to everything the company is saying about the vulnerability.</p>

The tech is pretty straightforward, but it's interesting to think about the types of scenarios in which it might be pulled off.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> As a warm-blooded mammalian species, we humans routinely leave thermal residues on various objects with which we come in contact. This includes common input devices, such as keyboards, that are used for entering (among other things) secret information, such as passwords and PINs. Although thermal residue dissipates over time, there is always a certain time window during which thermal energy readings can be harvested from input devices to recover recently entered, and potentially sensitive, information.

<p>To-date, there has been no systematic investigation of thermal profiles of keyboards, and thus no efforts have been made to secure them. This serves as our main motivation for constructing a means for password harvesting from keyboard thermal emanations. Specifically, we introduce Thermanator, a new post factum insider attack based on heat transfer caused by a user typing a password on a typical external keyboard. We conduct and describe a user study that collected thermal residues from 30 users entering 10 unique passwords (both weak and strong) on 4 popular commodity keyboards. Results show that entire sets of key-presses can be recovered by non-expert users as late as 30 seconds after initial password entry, while partial sets can be recovered as late as 1 minute after entry. Furthermore, we find that Hunt-and-Peck typists are particularly vulnerable. We also discuss some Thermanator mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>The main take-away of this work is three-fold: (1) using external keyboards to enter (already much-maligned) passwords is even less secure than previously recognized, (2) post factum (planned or impromptu) thermal imaging attacks are realistic, and finally (3) perhaps it is time to either stop using keyboards for password entry, or abandon passwords altogether.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Google and Microsoft researchers have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/21/17377994/google-microsoft-cpu-vulnerability-speculative-store-bypass-variant-4">disclosed</a> another Spectre-like CPU side-channel vulnerability, called "<a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-141A">Speculative Store Bypass</a>." Like the others, the fix will slow the CPU down.</p>

<p>The German tech site Heise <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/are-8-new-spectre-class-flaws-about-to-be-exposed/">reports</a> <a href="https://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Super-GAU-fuer-Intel-Weitere-Spectre-Luecken-im-Anflug-4039134.html">that</a> more are coming.</p>

<p>I'm not surprised. Writing about Spectre and Meltdown in January, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/01/spectre_and_mel_1.html">predicted</a> that we'll be seeing a lot more of these sorts of vulnerabilities.</p>

<blockquote><p>Spectre and Meltdown are pretty catastrophic vulnerabilities, but they only affect the confidentiality of data. Now that they -- and the research into the Intel ME vulnerability -- have shown researchers where to look, more is coming -- and what they'll find will be worse than either Spectre or Meltdown.</p></blockquote>

<p>I still predict that we'll be seeing lots more of these in the coming months and years, as we learn more about this class of vulnerabilities.</p>

	    <p>When Spectre and Meltdown were first announced earlier this year, pretty much everyone predicted that there would be many more attacks targeting branch prediction in microprocessors. Here's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/its-not-just-spectre-researchers-reveal-more-branch-prediction-attacks/">another one</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the new attack, an attacker primes the PHT and running branch instructions so that the PHT will always assume a particular branch is taken or not taken. The victim code then runs and makes a branch, which is potentially disturbing the PHT. The attacker then runs more branch instructions of its own to detect that disturbance to the PHT; the attacker knows that some branches should be predicted in a particular direction and tests to see if the victim's code has changed that prediction.

<p>The researchers looked only at Intel processors, using the attacks to leak information protected using Intel's SGX (Software Guard Extensions), a feature found on certain chips to carve out small sections of encrypted code and data such that even the operating system (or virtualization software) cannot access it. They also described ways the attack could be used against address space layout randomization and to infer data in encryption and image libraries.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Nice <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/air-gap-researcher-mordechai-guri/">profile</a> of Mordechai Guri, who researches a variety of clever ways to steal data over air-gapped computers.</p>

<blockquote><p>Guri and his fellow Ben-Gurion researchers have shown, for instance, that it&#x27;s possible to trick a fully offline computer into leaking data to another nearby device via the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/clever-attack-uses-sound-computers-fan-steal-data/">noise its internal fan generates</a>, by <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/03/stealing-data-computers-using-heat/">changing air temperatures in patterns that the receiving computer can detect with thermal sensors</a>, or even by <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/malware-sends-stolen-data-drone-just-pcs-blinking-led/">blinking out a stream of information from a computer hard drive LED to the camera on a quadcopter drone hovering outside a nearby window</a>. In new research published today, the Ben-Gurion team has even shown that they can pull data off a computer protected by not only an air gap, but also a Faraday cage designed to block all radio signals.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are side-channel attacks where one process can spy on other processes. They affect computers where an untrusted browser window can execute code, phones that have multiple apps running at the same time, and cloud computing networks that run lots of different processes at once. Fixing them either requires a patch that results in a major performance hit, or is impossible and requires a re-architecture of conditional execution in future CPU chips.</p>

<p>I'll be writing something for publication over the next few days. This post is basically just a link repository.</p>

<p><strong>JOEL ROSENTHAL:</strong> I want to begin by welcoming our colleagues from the <a href="https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/">Carnegie UK Trust</a>. This event is part of a study tour organized by the Trust inquiring into the future of public libraries, and as a subset of that question, the issue of privacy in the digital age. We began the discussion yesterday at the offices of the <a href="https://www.carnegie.org/">Carnegie Corporation</a> and at the <a href="https://www.nypl.org/">New York Public Library</a>, and we're delighted for the opportunity to expand it in a broader discussion with all of you today.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of being a Carnegie organization is that we benefit from the ideas, inspirations, and good works of our sister institutions. </p>

<p>Bruce Schneier, Fellow at Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Harvard University, discussed the complex balance between privacy and security in the golden age of data surveillance in a session titled âPrivacy and Prosperity How Can Governments Strike the Balance?â We live in a world where our data is collected all the time and everywhere (e-mails, social media, credit cards, etc.), what is the limit we are willing to accept? What are the consequences, and what can we do about them?</p>

<p>It regularly comes as a surprise to people that our own infrastructure can be used against us. And in the wake of terrorist attacks or plots, there are fear-induced calls to ban, disrupt or control that infrastructure. According to officials investigating the Mumbai attacks, the terrorists used images from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google">Google</a> Earth to help learn their way around. This isn't the first time Google Earth has been charged with helping terrorists: in 2007, Google Earth images of British military bases were found in the homes of <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070312-google-censor.html">Iraqi insurgents</a>. Incidents such as these have led many governments to demand that Google remove or blur images of sensitive locations: military bases, nuclear reactors, government buildings, and so on. An <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article5311241.ece">Indian court</a> has been asked to ban Google Earth entirely.</p>
<p>This isn't the only way our information technology helps terrorists. Last year, a US army intelligence <a href="http://bit.ly/terror4">report</a> worried that terrorists could plan their attacks using <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/twitter">Twitter</a>, and there are unconfirmed reports that the Mumbai terrorists read the <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/9863/report-indian-government-trying-to-block-twitter-as-terrorists-may-be-reading-it/">Twitter</a> feeds about their attacks to get real-time information they could use. British intelligence is worried that terrorists might use voice over IP services such as <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2008/09/15/232308/taliban-use-skype-voip-bug-to-evade-capture.htm">Skype</a> to communicate. Terrorists may train on <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22163811-2,00.html">Second Life and World of Warcraft</a>. We already know they use websites to spread their message and possibly even to recruit.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is exacerbated by open-wireless access, which has been repeatedly labelled a terrorist tool and which has been the object of attempted <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2009/01/open-wi-fi-is-f.html">bans</a>.</p>
<p>Mobile phone networks help terrorists, too. The Mumbai terrorists used them to communicate with each other. This has led some cities, including London, to propose turning off mobile phone coverage in the event of a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/dec/04/social-networking-terrorism">terrorist attack</a>.</p>
<p>Let's all stop and take a deep breath. By its very nature, communications infrastructure is general. It can be used to plan both legal and illegal activities, and it's generally impossible to tell which is which. When I send and receive email, it looks exactly the same as a terrorist doing the same thing. To the mobile phone network, a call from one terrorist to another looks exactly the same as a mobile phone call from one victim to another. Any attempt to ban or limit infrastructure affects everybody. If <a href="http://news.cnet.com/How-law-enforcement-uses-Google-Earth/2100-1025_3-6208034.html">India</a> bans Google Earth, a future terrorist won't be able to use it to plan; nor will anybody else. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/my_open_wireles.html">Open</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/wifi">Wi-Fi networks</a> are useful for many reasons, the large majority of them positive, and closing them down affects all those reasons. Terrorist attacks are very rare, and it is almost always a bad trade-off to deny society the benefits of a communications technology just because the bad guys might use it too.</p>
<p>Communications infrastructure is especially valuable during a terrorist attack. Twitter was the best way for people to get real-time information about the attacks in Mumbai. If the Indian government shut Twitter down - or London blocked mobile phone coverage - during a terrorist attack, the lack of communications for everyone, not just the terrorists, would increase the level of terror and could even increase the body count. Information lessens fear and makes people safer.</p>
<p>None of this is new. Criminals have used telephones and mobile phones since they were invented. Drug smugglers use airplanes and boats, radios and satellite phones. Bank robbers have long used cars and motorcycles as getaway vehicles, and horses before then. I haven't seen it talked about yet, but the Mumbai terrorists used boats as well. They also wore boots. They ate lunch at restaurants, drank bottled water, and breathed the air. Society survives all of this because the good uses of infrastructure far outweigh the bad uses, even though the good uses are - by and large - small and pedestrian and the bad uses are rare and spectacular. And while terrorism turns society's very infrastructure against itself, we only harm ourselves by dismantling that infrastructure in response - just as we would if we banned cars because <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/04/terrorism.terrorismandtravel">bank robbers</a> used them too.</p>

	<h2 class="entry" id="a011998">Malware Installed in Asus Computers through Hacked Update Process</h2>
	
	
		
	
    
	    <p>Kaspersky Labs is <a href="https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/">reporting</a> on a new supply chain attack they call "Shadowhammer."</p>

<blockquote><p>In January 2019, we discovered a sophisticated supply chain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility. The attack took place between June and November 2018 and according to our telemetry, it affected a large number of users. 

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, which were identified by their network adapters' MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses in the trojanized samples and this list was used to identify the actual intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique MAC addresses from over 200 samples used in this attack. Of course, there might be other samples out there with different MAC addresses in their list.</p>

<p>We believe this to be a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses <a href="https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/">the Shadowpad</a> and the <a href="https://blog.avast.com/update-to-the-ccleaner-5.33.6162-security-incident">CCleaner</a> incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed with legitimate certificates (eg: "ASUSTeK Computer Inc."). The malicious updaters were hosted on the official liveupdate01s.asus[.]com and liveupdate01.asus[.]com ASUS update servers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sophistication of the attack leads to the speculation that a nation-state -- and one of the cyber powers -- is responsible.</p>

<p>As I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/05/supply-chain_se.html">previously written</a>, supply chain security is "an incredibly complex problem." These attacks co-opt the very mechanisms we need to trust for our security. And the international nature of our industry results in an array of vulnerabilities that are very hard to secure.</p>

<p>Kim Zetter has a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers">really good article</a> on this. Check if your computer is infected <a href="https://shadowhammer.kaspersky.com/">here</a>, or use <a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps_for_Win10/ASUSDiagnosticTool/ASDT_v1.0.1.0.zip">this diagnostic tool</a> from Asus.</p>

<p>There are at least 2 groups interested in grabbing access to products going into mass market</p>

<p>1. Security Services  -  These are unstoppable.  See NSA repacking a Cisco Router.</p>

<p>2. Other folks for a lot of reasons - Money, Trolling, Notoriety and Pawnage.  See Lion King CD Distro when original CDs contained XXX content inserted during the CD Stamping Process.</p>

<p>Attacking supply systems is a long standing military objective. It's a very refined attack system and JIT made it super easy to do.</p>

<p>Trying to explain to people that just because it says XXX or the LED is green or it is in shrink wrap does not mean it really is XXX or the system is not failing or it's not been rewrapped, this doesn't seem to connect the dots for them.</p>

<p>While this concerns technology attacks, the same goes for consumer goods and foods.  Faked Virgin Olive Oil, prohibited products in foods, mislabeled items, rewrapped meats.  It's old hat and well known.</p>

<p>For every bar we place to prevent redirection, it is only as good as the implementation.  The system that permits an Updater to update malware or badware or crapware is useful for Group 1.  They do it regularly.  They are not going to allow the necessary changes.  Or at least not until a whole lot of folks refuse Dragonfly work projects and the companies that profit from them.<br />

<p>This is a point that neads further investigation / explanation,</p>

<p>"'The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed with legitimate certificates (eg: "ASUSTeK Computer Inc.").'"</p>

<p>The use was most unlikely to have been 'legitimate' which implies one of three things,</p>

<p>1, Private Key was stolen.<br />
2, Private Key was remade.<br />
3, Some form of collision was found.</p>

<p>Whilst nearly anybody can do the first because the technical skills are well known and fairly easily aquired, the last two are potentially restricted to just a handfull or two at the most of organisations in the world.</p>

<p>Of those you are looking at the SigInt agencies with not just the brains but also the computing resources to carry them out.</p>

<p>Also this is in many ways an apparent replay of stuxnet, with very few actual targets in it's scope (which also would have helped keep it covert).</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see the 600 numbers and use a service like Shodan etc to track them down to networks thus potentialy identify the targets. Then work backwards to identify the attackers. </p>

<p>@ALL:</p>

<p>Just one thing to remember MAC addresses are not always easy to get or associate with an individual.</p>

<p>One good way to do it is when the person crosses a boarder and the laptop is turned on to see it's not a bomb etc...</p>

<p>Thus a small bet is all the targets have traveled to only one or two countries collectively.</p>

<p>But for others, for goodness sake do not take your main laptop phone etc abroad with you, it's an APT risk to far for any sensible person to do these days.</p>

<p>It is a certain bet that at a number of boarders all your electronics are enumerated in many ways and they are all then stored away against the Identity in your travel documents along with your picture, finger print etc and no doubt in some cases your DNA and other fingerprints from the VIP / frequent flier lounge etc.</p>

<p>Yes it might sound a little paranoid today, but think of your tommorows. We've been through the same with 'collect it all' where you were paranoid before Ed Snowden and had good insight or insider knowledge afterwards. Be very clear they are out to get us all because like those collecting PII for advertising the information has value. Yours might be worthless today but will it always be? Likewise the person standing next to you in the airport que their DNA etc might be of value beyond price, thus overall the average cost of collecting everybodies DNA fingerprints and images is easily worth the minor price per individual, and it will only get less costly with time.</p>

<p>A couple of things I've seen missing from most reporting on this: </p>

<p>1) Asus needs to revoke those certs (Zetter at least mentioned this), and rethink how it protects them in future, if they're serious.  Everything else is just window dressing if they don't get that part right; and</p>

<p>2) Has anyone wondered whether Asus was complicit?  </p>

</p>
<p>One of the reasons this happened and for so long is that the current code signing peocess is broken.</p>

<p>A search of this blog shows that the failings of code signing has been mentioned for a decade or more, and two names saying it's not a good idea and why show up regularly, @Nick P and @Clive Robinson.</p>

<p>So to add to those comments,</p>

<p>In this case the failure is the "Upload and forget" behaviour of the organisation concerned. That is they can not have had a policy of actually checking the files after they were uploaded to ensure they had not been changed at any point in time in a timely manner.</p>

<p>After the warning of stuxnet not doing this sort of checking realy is negligent behaviour.</p>

<p>There are several fairly easy ways such 'image checking' can be done, but it would be wise these days to do a byte by byte comparison and not rely on hashes, as the likes of the NSA and GCHQ might have broken them.</p>

<p>In essence a copy of the files in genuine Read Only Format needs to be put on an effectively hidden computer. It either pulls the files on the public server down to check them every half hour or so. Or it's a little more sophisticated and checks the files 'off the wire' as users download them. Either way the malware substitute would have been caught very very quickly.</p>

<p>Whilst that will not solve the other issues identified and put up on this blog in the past, it will block this particular attack in future.</p>

<p>However it needs to be said that their have been other attacks developed by the GCHQ and the NSA that could achive the same result. That is the 'get in quick' attack where the first TCP packet that arives at the destination machine is accepted. Thus if the SigInt agencies can have the files distributed around the net they can get their malware loded packets to a users computer first.</p>

<p>As easy as this sounds, it's actually going to be quite hard to implement with COST systems. But that does not in any way suggest they do not have the capabilities to do it.</p>

</p>
<p><i>The malware had 600 unique MAC addresses it was seeking</i></p>

<p>If the malware looks for specific machine, characterised by a MAC for each adapter (Ethernet and a WiFi), then only 300 machines are really concerned.</p>

<p>How did the attacker select the MAC addresses? By running malware on the ASUS update server, and finding out who came to the watering hole that met the criteria? I found no mention of the common denominator linking the machines. A country? A company? Did AG Barr bowdlerize the report? [SNCR] A fuller picture might help Kaspersky reestablish its reputation.</p>

<p><i>Buried in those malicious samples were hard-coded MD5 hash values that turned out to be unique MAC addresses for network adapter cards. </i></p>

<p>OK, now we know that the malware was written by a 100â¬ rent-a-coder. :-)</p>

<p>What's not clear to me what exactly needs to be updated directly by ASUS. The machines would usually call home to Redmond for OS updating, but a BIOS upgrade would normally be initiated manually by the user. Stuff like video drivers would be delivered over the Microsoft channel, and not the OEM, isn't it?</p>

</p>
<p>The thing that concerns me is:</p>

<blockquote>
Kamluk said Kaspersky notified ASUS of the problem on January 31, and a Kaspersky employee met with ASUS in person on February 14. But he said the company has been largely unresponsive since then and has not notified ASUS customers about the issue. 
</blockquote>

<p>Hey, I get that it's hard to get this stuff right, and an oopsie can happen, but the real test is whether a company does the right thing once the oopsie is pointed out or not. </p>

<p>Going dark, pretending it didn't happen, and volunteering to suck don't make me want to do business with a company.</p>

<p>@nobody: Good question.  Apparently the malware was based on a modified version of a several-year-old legimate ASUS file, pointing towards attackers who were able to compromise Asus's signing and distribution infrastructure but not their code building/deploying infrastructure.  Had Asus (or individuals within it) been complicit, they likely (but who really knows) would have injected the malware as a software build dependency, not post-build at the signing stage.</p>

<p>Ohhhh.. question answered. I didn't realize Asus were Taiwanese. This is obviously some sort of Red Chinese operation against the Taiwanese, who might buy Asus hardware even for serious use for purely patriotic reasons.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with that, but hope they require the company to fix their security issues in future.</p>

<p>Mixed thoughts:<br />
1- If some state agency wants to know more about 600 MAC addresses this is none of our business and anyway if they really want them nothing can prevent it. And, if they're doing their homework properly(and why are we doubting it?) then it is a good thing that those MACs are taken care of.<br />
2- Have the MACs been published? Are they single MACs or across a range?<br />
3- Certificates give a false sense of security<br />
4- From an entrepreneur POV, I like spies to spy. It's their job. If they are doing their job, well that is great. </p>

<p>@65535:</p>

<p>The Microsoft court submission is well worth reading as it actually gives a nice description of how the Barium persons go about their activities.</p>

<p>Interestingly is the use of a 'headless C&C' technique (see paragraph 29 onwards) using blogs etc that was first publicaly described in almost exactly the same way on this blog some years ago now. So one or more of the Barium individuals might well be readers of this blog.</p>

<p>In which case 'Hi guys, how are your collars feeling a little hot and tight?'</p>

<p>Microsoft appear to believe that the targets for their activities are mainly in the Virginia area. Also one of the code break downs of the malware indicates that if the language on the computer is either Russian or Chinese it stops dead at that simple first check.</p>

<p>But Microsoft either don't know the warm body names of the two people they think they have found behind Barium or they are being a little cautious. </p>

<p>That said in other unrelated cases Brian Krebs has not just found warm bodies on less info in the past, he's actually found their real phone numbers and called them, so it's likely these Barium guys are as tracable with a little bit of investigation. That is unless their OpSec has been better than professional.</p>

<p>Anyway it's 'turning in time' the brain is getting tired I'll have a further look over things when I get up to greet the cold light of day ;-)</p>

<p>@wumpus:</p>

<p>"There's a whole long chain of trust here, and plenty of them are pretty weak. Don't assume that a collision was made when rubber hose cryptography would work much easier (or more likely social engineering)."</p>

<p>In the general case I'd agree with you.</p>

<p>But in this case some are claiming a million users were effected all over the globe, I can not see how they were socialy engineered in this case.</p>

<p>However yes people at the development end could have been hoodwinked or coerced in various ways to hand over either the private key or access to it. But I kind of see that as 'part and parcel' of the trade of theft / stealing. Frequently insiders are turned by blackmail or having members of their family threatened in various ways, along with 'doing a friend a favour' or being 'given a drink'.</p>

<p>The smarter criminals learned long ago --unlike many others-- that as a method of obtaining information, goods, or services, physical tourture of an individual was not as successfull and far riskier than threatening to do it to somebodies loved one. That is you make the individuals mind turn on themselves through their imagination. Essentially it's how the protection racket works, actually hurting people is reserved for those who either lack imagination or for some reason don't care and of these about one in six are likely to repay the favor ten or twenty fold which is one of the ways in which we end up with street gang warfare and injured bystanders. Which is bad for business which is why the smarter criminals tend to be more wary of using violence than others, and when they do, they tend not to leave those who might seek revenge behind. Which is why there are actually gangland 'hit men' / 'mechanics' actively employed, the less smart of whom tend to get caught. As has been pointed out killing people is easy but stupid unless you have meticulously pland how to stop enquires by the authorities or those left behind being made.</p>

<p>Similar issues arise with recruiting and using insiders as the Greek Phone Tapping scandle made clear.</p>

<p>I wonder if it might be desirable to establish a number of trusted platforms for hosting the hashes of software updates so that software update tools can download the hash from a number of platforms and ensure they all agree as well as agreeing with the actual update.</p>

<p>This would substantially reduce the risk of undetected software update attacks since it would force the malicious code to be contained in all versions of the update increasing the chances that security researchers would discover it.</p>

<p>@Tatutata (give or take an umlaut)</p>

<p>"How did the attacker select the MAC addresses? By running malware on the ASUS update server, and finding out who came to the watering hole that met the criteria?"</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>MAC addresses don't generally propagate over IP; the Asus update server doesn't see the visitor's MAC address. </p>

<p>Broadly speaking, you need to have hands on the machine whose MAC address you want, or be able to connect to it over ethernet (MAC addresses are used exclusively in the ethernet protocol). At risk of pointing out the obvious, ethernet is a LAN protocol. So you can't just hoover up the MAC addresses of all those visiting your website.</p>

<p>So whoever targeted those MACs had either laid hands on the corresponding PCs (e.g. border agents); or they had local access to the PC in question (perhaps via some kind of trojan or 'implant'); or they had local (or equivalent) access to another machine on the same LAN (perhaps by infiltrating that LAN).</p>

</p>
<p>To be clear: my supposition is that the MACs were collected from a single LAN, or perhaps a group of related LANs, by an intruder. I would like to know what the investigators know about the MAC addresses in question; there is no comment on this from the authors or from Kaspersky.</p>

<p>If the MACs represent a commercial or government entity, then there is a good chance that the network adapters were made by the same manufacturer - with the result that the default MAC address of many of those adapters will share the same prefix.</p>

<p>Have the owners of these LANs been notified? Or even identified?</p>

<p>I suspect that quite a lot of information about this story has been kept under wraps.</p>

<p>@Denton Scratch @TatÃ¼tata:</p>

<p>"So whoever targeted those MACs had either laid hands on the corresponding PCs"</p>

<p>There are potentially another ways.</p>

<p>You could also get them from hotels and confrences etc where your target 'uses the WiFi', it's not exactly difficult to turn an Android Mobile Phone into a WiFi sniffer. You could also just act as an AP with an Android phone without any modification so you could just walk up and sit at the same table with your phone in your top pocket...</p>

<p>Also there are less obvious ways favoured by various ICs so either 'hands on' in the supply chain or 'access to records' from the supply chain may well work.</p>

<p>Because MACs are --allegedly-- unique, they do get used from time to time as 'serial numbers' in software and the like (stupid I know but then anything to save 0.01cents in FMCE design).</p>

<p>But geting access to corporate LANs may not be as difficult as it sounds. Remember those Russia's that got the order of the boot for activities incompatible with diplomatic behaviour?</p>

<p>They were set up to go WiFi sniffing from a hotel car park to a target organisation. It's altogether possible there has been a 'drive by' passive sniff of traffic from a commercial site and the WiFi MACs are what are in the file.</p>

<p>The thing that a lot of people either do not know or have forgotton is MACs are like ISBNs not only are they effectively unique, they get issued in blocks or ranges, thus the first digits are in effect a 'Manufacturers Code' and due to the way things get manufactured other digits may end up being the equivalent of a 'model number'.</p>

<p>If the MACs were obtained from a 'drive by' it's also possible that this attack against Asus is not unique and other manufactures support sites have also been attacked in the same way...</p>

<p>@65535:</p>

<p>"As for the Russian and the Chinese - it is always them."</p>

<p>Of course not, nor is it just the US 'Evil Axis of Four' which adds Iran and North Korea, they are all 'distant bogiemen who's faces the people will never see, and who's voices will never be heard' so convenient as 'whiping boys'. </p>

<p>Why? Because we actually know that any and every Nation State with the ability to do it 'are doing it' and even those without the native ability are 'buying it in' or in effect 'outsourcing it'. Because if they were not there would not be so many private companies making very large amounts of money from packaging up exploits and back end big data systems for them. As somebody used to point out here about the US and the 'Evil Axis,of four', 'logically it does not make sense', thus is either highly improbable or effectively in human terms impossible.</p>

<p>But if you agree or not with the further 'Orwellian 1984' premise that 'Every great state requires a distant enemy for the people to focus on' as a way to stop them 'focusing on their state and it's failings towards them'. The US administrations 'Evil Axis of four' is unquestionably a cynically motivated political driven narative, ment as a diversion from the real state of things... Such behaviour, would more properly be called propaganda, if the US Goverment was legaly alowed to use it. But supposadly they are not, so instead we could use a nu-speak name of 'Fake-News', or should it be 'Real-News' (with the unwritten tag line of 'We know it's Real because we reboil it fresh every day for you to consume').</p>

<p>As for 'keeping it under wraps' I doubt we will ever know the truth. If things can be made out to be 'A distant enemy' then indictments can be issued, Grand Juries held, and a ham sandwich can be tried in absentia, massive fines levied, and thus sactions issued. All like a well oiled machine unless like a group of Russians you instruct US lawyers to contest the indictments from day one...</p>

<p>@Rach El:</p>

<p>"I wonder if MAC spoofing would circumvent the malware, or whether it is sufficiently sophisticated to seek out the hardcoded original MAC of the hardware."</p>

<p>The reason I said 'MACs are --allegedly-- unique' is that back a long time ago with the NE2000 cheapnet ethernet card, hardware manufacturers started using 'Electricaly Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory' (EEPROM) that we now call 'Flash' memory to store the MAC in, so there is not actually a 'hardcoded original MAC' any more, which is why it's daft to use it with the likes of Radius etc as an authentication method.</p>

<p>So yes not just run time spoofing will work but with the right bit of code the Flash can be changed as well (failing that at one time a hardware 'chip clamp' and change it electrically, if the Flash is a seperate chip, which in these days of SoCs is less likely).</p>

<p>What people tend to forget in this day and age of security vunerabilities is that 'knowing a number' is not a way to authenticate. Likewise 'using a secret number' is no better when people have access to the hardware. For two reasons,</p>

<p>1, Layers of software.<br />
2, Manufacturing returns.</p>

<p>There are so many layers of software between the 'number' and the interface over which authentication happens that it's not possible to check and verify on a remote machine, because it can be programed to lie (look up 'GÃ¶del Machines').</p>

<p>The profit in 'Fast Moving Consumer Electronics' (FMCE) is quite small (to non existant with IoT). The cost of a 'return for repair' is eyewateringly expensive when compared to that of the distribution cost. Therefore anything and everything that can be done remotely across a near zero cost to transfer information network is going to be done. This in effect means 'full mutability' even in the CPU. As long as things are mutable someone is going to change then, as that is the nature of the human condition. No matter what security you put in place on the hardware, someone will work out how to get around it, again it's part of the human condition.</p>

<p>Any one who ignores those two facts is in for a rude shock as the 'Cable and Satellite set top box' manufacturers found out over and over again. </p>

<p>"supply chain security is "an incredibly complex problem.""</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>It seems to me the answer is simple: Corporations need to stop using minimal security to save $$, or be held financially accountable when they don't.</p>

<p>Every time we see major corporations being hacked, there's a rush of people saying "security is hard" but when the next attack occurrs, it seems as if they've attempted nothing to abate it.</p>

<p>Questions nobody is asking:</p>

<p>1. How did hackers upload the trojan to the update server?<br />
2. WHY was the update server not made read-only on the public side?<br />
3. WHY doesn't ASUS have the ability to check any new files added to their servers with a hash table to see if it is one of their own?</p>

<p>All these corporate hacks make me think of a person who, in order to save money, decided to only put screen doors on their house instead of lock-and-key doors. Then they wonder why they keep getting robbed.</p>

<p>Some of them have been asked befor, in fact years before. I used to advise clients that web sites should where possible be static and read only or deploy a checking method as I described above,</p>

<p>"'In essence a copy of the files in genuine Read Only Format needs to be put on an effectively hidden computer. It either pulls the files on the public server down to check them every half hour or so. Or it's a little more sophisticated and checks the files 'off the wire' as users download them. Either way the malware substitute would have been caught very very quickly.'"</p>

<p>But as I noted above it does not solve all of the problems as 'State Level' attackers have shown they have other methods that site owners can do nothing about.</p>

	    <p>Data & Society just published</a> a report entitled "<a href="https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DS_Workplace_Monitoring_Surveillance_Explainer.pdf">Workplace Monitoring & Surveillance</a>":</p>

<blockquote><p>This explainer highlights four broad trends in employee monitoring and surveillance technologies:

<ul><li><b>Prediction and flagging tools</b> that aim to predict characteristics or behaviors of employees or that are designed to identify or deter perceived rule-breaking or fraud. Touted as useful management tools, they can augment biased and discriminatory practices in workplace evaluations and segment workforces into risk categories based on patterns of behavior.

<p><li><b>Biometric and health data</b> of workers collected through tools like wearables, fitness tracking apps, and biometric timekeeping systems as a part of employer- provided health care programs, workplace wellness, and digital tracking work shifts tools. Tracking non-work-related activities and information, such as health data, may challenge the boundaries of worker privacy, open avenues for discrimination, and raise questions about consent and workers' ability to opt out of tracking.</p>

<p><li><b>Remote monitoring and time-tracking</b> used to manage workers and measure performance remotely. Companies may use these tools to decentralize and lower costs by hiring independent contractors, while still being able to exert control over them like traditional employees with the aid of remote monitoring tools. More advanced time-tracking can generate itemized records of on-the-job activities, which can be used to facilitate wage theft or allow employers to trim what counts as paid work time.</p>

<p><li><b>Gamification and algorithmic management</b> of work activities through continuous data collection. Technology can take on management functions, such as sending workers automated "nudges" or adjusting performance benchmarks based on a worker's real-time progress, while gamification renders work activities into competitive, game-like dynamics driven by performance metrics. However, these practices can create punitive work environments that place pressures on workers to meet demanding and shifting efficiency benchmarks.</ul></blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/03/06/robo-taylorism.html">blog post</a> about this report, Cory Doctorow mentioned "the adoption curve for oppressive technology, which goes, 'refugee, immigrant, prisoner, mental patient, children, welfare recipient, blue collar worker, white collar worker.'" I don't agree with the ordering, but the sentiment is correct. These technologies are generally used first against people with diminished rights: prisoners, children, the mentally ill, and soldiers.</p>

	    <p>The Nest home alarm system shipped with a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3336227/security/nest-secure-had-a-secret-microphone-can-now-be-a-google-assistant.html">secret</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/googles-nest-security-system-shipped-with-a-secret-microphone/">microphone</a>, which -- according to the company -- was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/nest-microphone-was-never-supposed-to-be-a-secret-2019-2">only an accidental secret</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>On Tuesday, a Google spokesperson told Business Insider the company had made an "error."

<p>"The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the tech specs," the spokesperson said. "That was an error on our part."</p></blockquote>

<p>Where are the consumer protection agencies? They should be all over this.</p>

<p>And while they're figuring out which laws Google broke, they should also look at American Airlines. Turns out that some of their seats have <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/american-airlines-planes-entertainment-system-cameras">built-in cameras</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>American Airlines spokesperson Ross Feinstein confirmed to BuzzFeed News that cameras are present on some of the airlines' in-flight entertainment systems, but said "they have never been activated, and American is not considering using them." Feinstein added, "Cameras are a standard feature on many in-flight entertainment systems used by multiple airlines. Manufacturers of those systems have included cameras for possible future uses, such as hand gestures to control in-flight entertainment."</p></blockquote>

<p>That makes it all okay, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Actually, I kind of understand the airline seat camera thing. My guess is that whoever designed the in-flight entertainment system just specced a standard tablet computer, and they all came with unnecessary features like cameras. This is how we end up with refrigerators with Internet connectivity and Roombas with <a href="http://www.monohelixlabs.com/spying-on-roomba.html">microphones</a>. It's cheaper to leave the functionality in than it is to remove it.</p>

<p>Still, we need better disclosure laws.</p>

	    <p>The police are increasingly <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/reverse-location-search-warrants-google-police.html">getting search warrants</a> for information about all cell phones in a certain location at a certain time:</p>

<blockquote><p>Police departments across the country have been knocking at Google's door for at least the last two years with warrants to tap into the company's extensive stores of cellphone location data. Known as "reverse location search warrants," these legal mandates allow law enforcement to sweep up the coordinates and movements of every cellphone in a broad area. The police can then check to see if any of the phones came close to the crime scene. In doing so, however, the police can end up not only fishing for a suspect, but also gathering the location data of potentially hundreds (or thousands) of innocent people. There have only been anecdotal reports of reverse location searches, so it's unclear how widespread the practice is, but privacy advocates worry that Google's data will eventually allow more and more departments to conduct indiscriminate searches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it's not just Google who can provide this information.</p>

<p>I am also reminded of a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csec-used-airport-wi-fi-to-track-canadian-travellers-edward-snowden-documents-1.2517881">Canadian</a> <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news2/pdf/airports_redacted.pdf">surveillance program</a> disclosed by Snowden.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time talking about this sort of thing in <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/data_and_goliath/"><i>Data and Goliath</i></a>. Once you have everyone under surveillance all the time, many things are possible.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011854"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/11/how_surveillanc_1.html">How Surveillance Inhibits Freedom of Expression</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>In my book <cite>Data and Goliath</cite>, I write about the value of privacy. I talk about how it is essential for political liberty and justice, and for commercial fairness and equality. I talk about how it increases personal freedom and individual autonomy, and how the lack of it makes us all less secure. But this is probably the most important argument as to why society as a whole must protect privacy: it allows society to progress.</p>

<p>We know that surveillance has a chilling effect on freedom. People change their behavior when they live their lives under surveillance. They are less likely to speak freely and act individually. They self-censor. They become conformist. This is obviously true for government surveillance, but is true for corporate surveillance as well. We simply aren't as willing to be our individual selves when others are watching.</p>

<p>Let's take an example: hearing that parents and children are being separated as they cross the US border, you want to learn more. You visit the website of an international immigrants' rights group, a fact that is available to the government through mass Internet surveillance. You sign up for the group's mailing list, another fact that is potentially available to the government. The group then calls or e-mails to invite you to a local meeting. Same. Your license plates can be collected as you drive to the meeting; your face can be scanned and identified as you walk into and out of the meeting. If, instead of visiting the website, you visit the group's Facebook page, Facebook knows that you did and that feeds into its profile of you, available to advertisers and political activists alike. Ditto if you like their page, share a link with your friends, or just post about the issue.</p>

<p>Maybe you are an immigrant yourself, documented or not. Or maybe some of your family is. Or maybe you have friends or coworkers who are. How likely are you to get involved if you know that your interest and concern can be gathered and used by government and corporate actors? What if the issue you are interested in is pro- or anti-gun control, anti-police violence or in support of the police? Does that make a difference?</p>

<p>Maybe the issue doesn't matter, and you would never be afraid to be identified and tracked based on your political or social interests. But even if you are so fearless, you probably know someone who has more to lose, and thus more to fear, from their personal, sexual, or political beliefs being exposed.</p>

<p>This isn't just hypothetical. In the months and years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many of us censored what we spoke about on social media or what we searched on the Internet. We know from a 2013 PEN study that writers in the United States self-censored their browsing habits out of fear the government was watching. And this isn't exclusively an American event; Internet self-censorship is prevalent across the globe, China being a prime example.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this fear stagnates society in two ways. The first is that the presence of surveillance means society cannot experiment with new things without fear of reprisal, and that means those experimentsÂ­ -- if found to be inoffensive or even essential to society -- Â­cannot slowly become commonplace, moral, and then legal. If surveillance nips that process in the bud, change never happens. All social progressÂ­ -- from ending slavery to fighting for women's rightsÂ­ -- began as ideas that were, quite literally, dangerous to assert. Yet without the ability to safely develop, discuss, and eventually act on those assertions, our society would not have been able to further its democratic values in the way that it has.</p>

<p>Consider the decades-long fight for gay rights around the world. Within our lifetimes we have made enormous strides to combat homophobia and increase acceptance of queer folks' right to marry. Queer relationships slowly progressed from being viewed as immoral and illegal, to being viewed as somewhat moral and tolerated, to finally being accepted as moral and legal.</p>

<p>In the end, it was the public nature of those activities that eventually slayed the bigoted beast, but the ability to act in private was essential in the beginning for the early experimentation, community building, and organizing.</p>

<p>Marijuana legalization is going through the same process: it's currently sitting between somewhat moral, andÂ­ -- depending on the state or country in question -- Â­tolerated and legal. But, again, for this to have happened, someone decades ago had to try pot and realize that it wasn't really harmful, either to themselves or to those around them. Then it had to become a counterculture, and finally a social and political movement. If pervasive surveillance meant that those early pot smokers would have been arrested for doing something illegal, the movement would have been squashed before inception. Of course the story is more complicated than that, but the ability for members of society to privately smoke weed was essential for putting it on the path to legalization.</p>

<p>We don't yet know which subversive ideas and illegal acts of today will become political causes and positive social change tomorrow, but they're around. And they require privacy to germinate. Take away that privacy, and we'll have a much harder time breaking down our inherited moral assumptions.</p>

<p>The second way surveillance hurts our democratic values is that it encourages society to make more things illegal. Consider the things you doÂ­ -- the different things each of us doesÂ­ -- that portions of society find immoral. Not just recreational drugs and gay sex, but gambling, dancing, public displays of affection. All of us do things that are deemed immoral by some groups, but are not illegal because they don't harm anyone. But it's important that these things can be done out of the disapproving gaze of those who would otherwise rally against such practices.</p>

<p>If there is no privacy, there will be pressure to change. Some people will recognize that their morality isn't necessarily the morality of everyoneÂ­ -- and that that's okay. But others will start demanding legislative change, or using less legal and more violent means, to force others to match their idea of morality.</p>

<p>It's easy to imagine the more conservative (in the small-c sense, not in the sense of the named political party) among us getting enough power to make illegal what they would otherwise be forced to witness. In this way, privacy helps protect the rights of the minority from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>This is how we got Prohibition in the 1920s, and if we had had today's surveillance capabilities in the 1920s, it would have been far more effectively enforced. Recipes for making your own spirits would have been much harder to distribute. Speakeasies would have been impossible to keep secret. The criminal trade in illegal alcohol would also have been more effectively suppressed. There would have been less discussion about the harms of Prohibition, less "what if we didn't?" thinking. Political organizing might have been difficult. In that world, the law might have stuck to this day.</p>

<p>China serves as a cautionary tale. The country has long been a world leader in the ubiquitous surveillance of its citizens, with the goal not of crime prevention but of social control. They are about to further enhance their system, giving every citizen a "social credit" rating. The details are yet unclear, but the general concept is that people will be rated based on their activities, both online and off. Their political comments, their friends and associates, and everything else will be assessed and scored. Those who are conforming, obedient, and apolitical will be given high scores. People without those scores will be denied privileges like access to certain schools and foreign travel. If the program is half as far-reaching as early reports indicate, the subsequent pressure to conform will be enormous. This social surveillance system is precisely the sort of surveillance designed to maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>For social norms to change, people need to deviate from these inherited norms. People need the space to try alternate ways of living without risking arrest or social ostracization. People need to be able to read critiques of those norms without anyone's knowledge, discuss them without their opinions being recorded, and write about their experiences without their names attached to their words. People need to be able to do things that others find distasteful, or even immoral. The minority needs protection from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>Privacy makes all of this possible. Privacy encourages social progress by giving the few room to experiment free from the watchful eye of the many. Even if you are not personally chilled by ubiquitous surveillance, the society you live in is, and the personal costs are unequivocal.</p>

	    <p>The US <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/">Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board </a>is <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/executive-director/">looking</a> for a director. Among other things, this board has some oversight role over the NSA. More precisely, it can examine what any executive-branch agency is doing about counterterrorism. So it can examine the program of TSA watchlists, NSA anti-terrorism surveillance, and FBI counterterrorism activities.</p>

<p>The PCLOB was established in 2004 (when it didn't do much), disappeared from 2007-2012, and reconstituted in 2012. It issued a <a href="https://www.pclob.gov/library/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Records_Program.pdf">major report</a> on NSA surveillance in 2014. It has dwindled since then, having as few as one member. Last month, the Senate <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/senate-confirms-three-pclob-members-ahead-of-privacy-shield-second-annual-review/">confirmed</a> three new members, including Ed Felten.</p>

<p>So, potentially an important job if anyone out there is interested.</p>

	    <p>The Israeli Defense Force mounted a botched raid in Gaza. They were attempting to install surveillance gear, which they ended up leaving behind. (There are <a href="https://news.walla.co.il/item/3199847">photos</a> -- scroll past the video.) Israeli media is claiming that the capture of this gear by Hamas causes major damage to Israeli electronic surveillance capabilities. The Israelis themselves destroyed the vehicle the commandos used to enter Gaza. I'm guessing they did so because there was more gear in it they didn't want falling into the Palestinians' hands.</p>

<p>Can anyone intelligently speculate about what the photos shows? And if there are other photos on the Internet, please post them. </p>

	    <p>IoT devices are surveillance devices, and manufacturers generally use them to collect data on their customers. Surveillance is still the business model of the Internet, and this data is used against the customers' interests: either by the device manufacturer or by some third party the manufacturer sells the data to. Of course, this data can be used by the police as well; the purpose depends on the country. </p>

<p>None of this is new, and much of it was discussed in my book <i><a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/data_and_goliath/">Data and Goliath</a></i>. What is common is for Internet companies is to publish "transparency reports" that give at least general information about how police are using that data. IoT companies don't publish those reports.</p>

<p>TechCrunch asked a bunch of companies about this, and basically found that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/19/smart-home-devices-hoard-data-government-demands/">no one is talking</a>.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011786"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/10/another_bloombe.html">Another Bloomberg Story about Supply-Chain Hardware Attacks from China</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom">another story</a> about hardware surveillance implants in equipment made in China. This implant is different from the one Bloomberg reported on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/10/chinese_supply_.html">last week</a>. That story has been denied by pretty much everyone else, but Bloomberg is sticking by its story and its sources. (I linked to other commentary and analysis <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/10/chinese_supply_.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Again, I have no idea what's true. The story is plausible. The denials are about what you'd expect. My lone hesitation to believing this is not seeing a photo of the hardware implant. If these things were in servers all over the US, you'd think someone would have come up with a photograph by now.</p>

	    <p>Interesting <a href="http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2018/019182/crowd-counting-through-walls-wifi">research</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the team's experiments, one WiFi transmitter and one WiFi receiver are behind walls, outside a room in which a number of people are present. The room can get very crowded with as many as 20 people zigzagging each other. The transmitter sends a wireless signal whose received signal strength (RSSI) is measured by the receiver. Using only such received signal power measurements, the receiver estimates how many people are inside the room Â­ an estimate that closely matches the actual number. It is noteworthy that the researchers do not do any prior measurements or calibration in the area of interest; their approach has only a very short calibration phase that need not be done in the same area.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>The so-called Crypto Wars have been going on <a href="https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3407-doomed-to-repeat-history-lessons-from-the-crypto-wars-of-the-1990s/Crypto%20Wars_ReDo.7cb491837ac541709797bdf868d37f52.pdf">for 25 years</a> now. Basically, the FBI -- and some of their peer agencies in the UK, Australia, and elsewhere -- <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">argue</a> that the pervasive use of civilian encryption is hampering their ability to solve crimes and that they need the tech companies to make their systems susceptible to government eavesdropping. Sometimes their complaint is about communications systems, like voice or messaging apps. Sometimes it's about end-user devices. On the other side of this debate is pretty much all technologists working in computer security and cryptography, who <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">argue</a> that adding eavesdropping features fundamentally makes those systems less secure.</p>

<p>A recent entry in this debate is a <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate">proposal</a> by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson, both from the UK's GCHQ (the British signals-intelligence agency -- basically, its NSA). It's actually a positive contribution to the discourse around backdoors; most of the time government officials broadly demand that the tech companies <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rod-rosenstein-encryption-backdoor/">figure out a way</a> to meet their requirements, without providing any details. Levy and Robinson write:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a world of encrypted services, a potential solution could be to go back a few decades. It's relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call. The service provider usually controls the identity system and so really decides who's who and which devices are involved -- they're usually involved in introducing the parties to a chat or call. You end up with everything still being end-to-end encrypted, but there's an extra 'end' on this particular communication. This sort of solution seems to be no more intrusive than the virtual crocodile clips that our democratically elected representatives and judiciary authorise today in traditional voice intercept solutions and certainly doesn't give any government power they shouldn't have.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the surface, this isn't a big ask. It doesn't affect the encryption that protects the communications. It only affects the authentication that assures people of whom they are talking to. But it's no less dangerous a backdoor than any others that have been proposed: It exploits a security vulnerability rather than fixing it, and it opens all users of the system to exploitation of that same vulnerability by others.</p>

<p>In a blog post, cryptographer Matthew Green <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/12/17/on-ghost-users-and-messaging-backdoors/">summarized</a> the technical problems with this GCHQ proposal. Basically, making this backdoor work requires not only changing the cloud computers that oversee communications, but it also means changing the client program on everyone's phone and computer. And that change makes all of those systems less secure. Levy and Robinson make a big deal of the fact that their backdoor would only be targeted against specific individuals and their communications, but it's still a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/62114/give-ghost-backdoor/">general backdoor</a> that <em>could</em> be used against anybody.</p>

<p>The basic problem is that a backdoor is a technical capability -- a vulnerability -- that is available to anyone who knows about it and has access to it. Surrounding that vulnerability is a procedural system that tries to limit access to that capability. Computers, especially internet-connected computers, are inherently hackable, limiting the effectiveness of any procedures. The best defense is to not have the vulnerability at all.</p>

<p>That old physical eavesdropping system Levy and Robinson allude to also exploits a security vulnerability. Because telephone conversations were unencrypted as they passed through the physical wires of the phone system, the police were able to go to a switch in a phone company facility or a junction box on the street and manually attach alligator clips to a specific pair and listen in to what that phone transmitted and received. It was a vulnerability that anyone could exploit -- not just the police -- but was mitigated by the fact that the phone company was a monolithic monopoly, and physical access to the wires was either difficult (inside a phone company building) or obvious (on the street at a junction box).</p>

<p>The functional equivalent of physical eavesdropping for modern computer phone switches is a requirement of a 1994 U.S. law called CALEA -- and similar laws in other countries. By law, telephone companies must engineer phone switches that the government can eavesdrop, mirroring that old physical system with computers. It is not the same thing, though. It doesn't have those same physical limitations that make it more secure. It can be administered remotely. And it's implemented by a computer, which makes it vulnerable to the same hacking that every other computer is vulnerable to.</p>

<p>This isn't a theoretical problem; these systems have been subverted. The most <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair">public incident</a> dates from 2004 in Greece. Vodafone Greece had phone switches with the eavesdropping feature mandated by CALEA. It was turned off by default in the Greek phone system, but the NSA managed to surreptitiously <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/">turn it on</a> and use it to eavesdrop on the Greek prime minister and over 100 other high-ranking dignitaries.</p>

<p>There's nothing distinct about a phone switch that makes it any different from other modern encrypted voice or chat systems; any remotely administered backdoor system will be just as vulnerable. Imagine a chat program added this GCHQ backdoor. It would have to add a feature that added additional parties to a chat from somewhere in the system -- and not by the people at the endpoints. It would have to suppress any messages alerting users to another party being added to that chat. Since some chat programs, like iMessage and Signal, automatically send such messages, it would force those systems to lie to their users. Other systems would simply never implement the "tell me who is in this chat conversation" featureÂ­which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>And once that's in place, every government will try to hack it for its own purposesÂ­ -- just as the NSA hacked Vodafone Greece. Again, this is nothing new. In 2010, China successfully hacked the back-door mechanism Google <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/china-google-attack-part-widespread-spying-effort-28293/">put in place</a> to meet law-enforcement requests. In 2015, someone -- we don't know who -- <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232227-where-did-i-leave-my-keys/abstract">hacked an NSA backdoor</a> in a random-number generator used to create encryption keys, changing the parameters so they could also eavesdrop on the communications. There are certainly other stories that haven't been made public.</p>

<p>Simply adding the feature erodes public trust. If you were a dissident in a totalitarian country trying to communicate securely, would you want to use a voice or messaging system that is known to have this sort of backdoor? Who would you bet on, especially when the cost of losing the bet might be imprisonment or worse: the company that runs the system, or your country's government intelligence agency? If you were a senior government official, or the head of a large multinational corporation, or the security manager or a critical technician at a power plant, would you want to use this system?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Two years ago, there was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-design-feature-encrypted-messages">rumor</a> of a WhatsApp backdoor. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/flawed-reporting-about-whatsapp">details</a> are <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/exceptional-access-devil-details-0">complicated</a>, and calling it a backdoor or a vulnerability <a href="https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/">is</a> <a href="http://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687">largely</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5nq201/whatsapp_backdoor_allows_snooping_on_encrypted/dce86wa/?st=jpfg671x&amp;sh=482f0949">inaccurate</a> -- but the resultant confusion caused some people to abandon the encrypted messaging service.</p>

<p>Trust is fragile, and <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/pjcis-2018/">transparency</a> is essential to trust. And while Levy and Robinson state that "any exceptional access solution should not fundamentally change the trust relationship between a service provider and its users," this proposal does exactly that. Communications companies could no longer be honest about what their systems were doing, and we would have no reason to trust them if they tried.</p>

<p>In the end, all of these exceptional access mechanisms, whether they exploit existing vulnerabilities that should be closed or force vendors to open new ones, reduce the security of the underlying system. They reduce our reliance on security technologies we know how to do well -- cryptography -- to computer security technologies we are much less good at. Even worse, they replace technical security measures with organizational procedures. Whether it's a database of master keys that could decrypt an iPhone or a communications switch that orchestrates who is securely chatting with whom, it is vulnerable to attack. And it will be attacked.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion is a specific example of a broader discussion that we need to have, and it's about the attack/defense balance. Which should we prioritize? Should we design our systems to be open to attack, in which case they can be exploited by law enforcement -- and others? Or should we design our systems to be as secure as possible, which means they will be better protected from hackers, criminals, foreign governments and -- unavoidably -- law enforcement as well?</p>

<p>This discussion is larger than the FBI's ability to solve crimes or the NSA's ability to spy. We know that foreign intelligence services are targeting the communications of our elected officials, our power infrastructure, and our voting systems. Do we really want some foreign country penetrating our lawful-access backdoor in the same way the NSA penetrated Greece's?</p>

<p>I have long maintained that we need to adopt a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/AC_StrategyPapers_No8_Saving_Cyberspace_WEB.pdf">defense-dominant strategy</a>: We should prioritize our need for security over our need for surveillance. This is especially true in the new world of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/">physically capable computers</a>. Yes, it will mean that law enforcement will have a harder time eavesdropping on communications and unlocking computing devices. But law enforcement has <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">other forensic techniques</a> to collect surveillance data in our highly networked world. We'd be much better off <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20160301/104573/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-LandauS-20160301.pdf">increasing law enforcement's technical ability</a> to investigate crimes in the <a href="https://cdt.org/blog/%E2%80%98going-dark%E2%80%99-versus-a-%E2%80%98golden-age-for-surveillance%E2%80%99/">modern digital world</a> than we would be to weaken security for everyone. The ability to surreptitiously add ghost users to a conversation is a vulnerability, and it's one that we would be better served by closing than exploiting.</p>

	    <p>Modern cars have alarm systems that automatically connect to a remote call center. This makes cars harder to steal, since tripping the alarm causes a quick response. <a href="https://mrooding.me/a-dutch-first-ingenious-bmw-theft-attempt-5f7f49a96ec8">This article</a> describes a theft attempt that tried to neutralize that security system. In the first attack, the thieves just disabled the alarm system and then left. If the owner had not immediately repaired the car, the thieves would have returned the next night and -- no longer working under time pressure -- stolen the car.</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011649"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/on_financial_fr.html">On Financial Fraud</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>There are some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/28/how-to-get-away-with-financial-fraud">good lessons</a> in this article on financial fraud:</p>

<blockquote><p>That's how we got it so wrong. We were looking for incidental breaches of technical regulations, not systematic crime. And the thing is, that's normal. The nature of fraud is that it works outside your field of vision, subverting the normal checks and balances so that the world changes while the picture stays the same. People in financial markets have been missing the wood for the trees for as long as there have been markets.

<p>[..]</p>

<p>Trust -- particularly between complete strangers, with no interactions beside relatively anonymous market transactions -- is the basis of the modern industrial economy. And the story of the development of the modern economy is in large part the story of the invention and improvement of technologies and institutions for managing that trust.</p>

<p>And as industrial society develops, it becomes easier to be a victim. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described how prosperity derived from the division of labour -- the 18 distinct operations that went into the manufacture of a pin, for example. While this was going on, the modern world also saw a growing division of trust. The more a society benefits from the division of labour in checking up on things, the further you can go into a con game before you realise that you're in one.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Libor teaches us a valuable lesson about commercial fraud -- that unlike other crimes, it has a problem of denial as well as one of detection. There are very few other criminal acts where the victim not only consents to the criminal act, but voluntarily transfers the money or valuable goods to the criminal. And the hierarchies, status distinctions and networks that make up a modern economy also create powerful psychological barriers against seeing fraud when it is happening. White-collar crime is partly defined by the kind of person who commits it: a person of high status in the community, the kind of person who is always given the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Fraudsters don't play on moral weaknesses, greed or fear; they play on weaknesses in the system of checks and balances -- the audit processes that are meant to supplement an overall environment of trust. One point that comes up again and again when looking at famous and large-scale frauds is that, in many cases, everything could have been brought to a halt at a very early stage if anyone had taken care to confirm all the facts. But nobody does confirm all the facts. There are just too bloody many of them. Even after the financial rubble has settled and the arrests been made, this is a huge problem.</p></blockquote>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a011478"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/02/e-mail_leaves_a.html">E-Mail Leaves an Evidence Trail</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>If you're going to commit an illegal act, it's best <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/paul-manafort-couldnt-convert-pdfs-to-word-documents.html">not to discuss it in e-mail</a>. It's also best to Google tech instructions rather than asking someone else to do it:</p>

<blockquote><p>One new detail from the indictment, however, points to just <i>how</i> unsophisticated Manafort seems to have been. Here's the relevant passage from the indictment. I've bolded the most important bits:

<blockquote><p>Manafort and Gates made numerous false and fraudulent representations to secure the loans. For example, Manafort provided the bank with doctored [profit and loss statements] for [Davis Manafort Inc.] for both 2015 and 2016, overstating its income by millions of dollars. The doctored 2015 DMI P&L submitted to Lender D was the same false statement previously submitted to Lender C, which overstated DMI's income by more than $4 million. The doctored 2016 DMI P&L was inflated by Manafort by more than $3.5 million. To create the false 2016 P&L, on or about October 21, 2016, <b>Manafort emailed Gates a .pdf version</b> of the real 2016 DMI P&L, which showed a loss of more than $600,000. <b>Gates converted that .pdf into a "Word" document so that it could be edited</b>, which Gates sent back to Manafort. <b>Manafort altered that "Word" document</b> by adding more than $3.5 million in income. He then <b>sent this falsified P&L to Gates and asked that the "Word" document be converted back to a .pdf, which Gates did and returned to Manafort</b>. Manafort then sent the falsified 2016 DMI P&L .pdf to Lender D.</p></blockquote>

<p>So here's the essence of what went wrong for Manafort and Gates, according to Mueller's investigation: Manafort allegedly wanted to falsify his company's income, but he couldn't figure out how to edit the PDF. He therefore had Gates turn it into a Microsoft Word document for him, which led the two to bounce the documents back-and-forth over email. As attorney and blogger Susan Simpson <a href="https://twitter.com/TheViewFromLL2/status/966807752696909826">notes on Twitter</a>, Manafort's inability to complete a basic task on his own seems to have effectively "created an incriminating paper trail."</p></blockquote>

<p>If there's a lesson here, it's that the Internet constantly generates data about what people are doing on it, and that data is all potential evidence. The FBI is 100% wrong that they're <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4325815-Director-Wray-Testimony.html#document/p5/a392750">going dark</a>; it's really the <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-08-15%20Swire%20Testimony.pdf">golden age of surveillance</a>, and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/">FBI's panic</a> is really just its own <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/01/wiretap-backdoors/">lack of technical sophistication</a>. </p>

	    <p>Daphne Caruana Galizia was a Maltese journalist whose anti-corruption investigations exposed powerful people. She was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/daphne-caruana-galizia-malta-journalist-funeral-justice-car-bomb-valletta-a8038531.html">murdered</a> in October by a car bomb.</p>

<p>Galizia used WhatsApp to <a href="https://daphnecaruanagalizia.com/2017/04/former-current-employees-malta-financial-services-authority-financial-intelligence-analysis-unit-police-state-authorities-pilatus-bank-can-contact-full-confid/">communicate securely</a> with her sources. Now that she is dead, the Maltese police want to break into her phone or the app, and find out who those sources were.</p>

<p>One journalist <a href="http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-10-25/local-news/Daphne-s-murder-Laptop-was-not-found-on-the-crime-scene-sources-6736180615">reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Part of Daphne's destroyed smart phone was elevated from the scene.

<p>Investigators say that Caruana Galizia had not taken her laptop with her on that particular trip. If she had done so, the forensic experts would have found evidence on the ground.</p>

<p>Her mobile phone is also being examined, as can be seen from her WhatsApp profile, which has registered activity since the murder. But it is understood that the data is safe.</p>

<p>Sources close to the newsroom said that as part of the investigation her sim card has been cloned. This is done with the help of mobile service providers in similar cases. Asked if her WhatsApp messages or any other messages that were stored in her phone will be retrieved, the source said that since the messaging application is encrypted, the messages cannot be seen. Therefore it is unlikely that any data can be retrieved.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am less optimistic than that reporter. The FBI is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malta-carbomb-usa/u-s-condemns-killing-of-malta-journalist-says-fbi-assisting-probe-idUSKBN1CM2VM">providing "specific assistance</a>." The article doesn't explain that, but I would not be surprised if they were helping crack the phone.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if WhatsApp's security survives this. My guess is that it depends on how much of the phone was recovered from the bombed car.</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (11/7): The court-appointed IT expert on the case has a <a href="https://www.timesofmalta.com/mobile/articles/view/20171030/local/rejected-expert-appointed-to-caruana-galizia-murder-probe.661612">criminal record in the UK</a> for theft and forgery.</p>

<h2>Click Here to Kill Everybody</h2>
<h3>Security and Survival in a Hyper-connected World</h3>
<p><strong>A Book by Bruce Schneier</strong></p>
<p><em>The internet is powerful, but it is not safe. As "smart" devices proliferate the risks will get worse, unless we act now.</em></p>
<p>From driverless cars to smart thermostats, from autonomous stock-trading systems to drones equipped with their own behavioral algorithms, the internet now has direct effects on the physical world. While this computerized future, often called the Internet of Things, carries enormous potential, best-selling author Bruce Schneier argues that catastrophe awaits in its new vulnerabilities and dangers. Forget data theft: cutting-edge digital attackers can now literally crash your car, pacemaker, and home security system, as well as everyone else's. In Click Here to Kill Everybody, Schneier explores the risks and security implications of our new, hyper-connected era, and lays out common-sense policies that will allow us to enjoy the benefits of this omnipotent age without falling prey to the consequences of its insecurity. From principles for a more resilient Internet of Things to a recipe for sane government oversight, Schneier's vision is required reading for anyone invested in human flourishing.</p>

<h4>Praise for <cite>Click Here to Kill Everybody</cite></h4>
âSchneier skillfully guides readers through serious attacks that have happened alreadyâand moves on to those he believes are just over the horizon [...] Schneier sets out detailed solutions that should be required reading for politicians across the world.â
<p class="attribution">âFinancial Times</p>
<p>âSchneier, more than the average policymaker or marketing blowhard, has a pretty good idea of what the actual benefits of these systems can be. He avoids the twin temptations of wholesale dismissal and breathless hype, and charts a course that manages the tricky business of being both nuanced and exciting.â</p>
<p class="attribution">âCory Doctorow, BoingBoing.net</p>
<p>â[Click Here to Kill Everybody] is sober, lucid and often wise in diagnosing how the security challenges posed by the expanding Internet came about, and in proposing what should (but probably wonât) be done about them.â</p>
<p class="attribution">âNature</p>
<p>âThis thought-provoking book will mainly have you nodding in agreement and shaking your head in frustration. The future is not yet written, and so prediction, like attribution, is hard. Hopefully, enough people will read the book to change the path of the future. I plan to re-read it, and there can be no greater praise.â</p>
<p class="attribution">âPaul Baccas, Virus Bulletin</p>
<p>âUseful for an internet user but particularly for those concerned with privacy, civil liberties, and related issues.â</p>
<p class="attribution">âKirkus Reviews</p>

	    <p>Really interesting <a href="https://tacticaltech.org/media/Personal-Data-Political-Persuasion-How-it-works.pdf">report</a> from Tactical Tech.</p>

<blockquote><p>Data-driven technologies are an inevitable feature of modern political campaigning. Some argue that they are a welcome addition to politics as normal and a necessary and modern approach to democratic processes; others say that they are corrosive and diminish trust in already flawed political systems. The use of these technologies in political campaigning is not going away; in fact, we can only expect their sophistication and prevalence to grow. For this reason, the techniques and methods need to be reviewed outside the dichotomy of 'good' or 'bad' and beyond the headlines of 'disinformation campaigns'.

<p>All the data-driven methods presented in this guide would not exist without the commercial digital marketing and advertising industry. From analysing behavioural data to A/B testing and from geotargeting to psychometric profiling, political parties are using the same techniques to sell political candidates to voters that companies use to sell shoes to consumers. The question is, is that appropriate? And what impact does it have not only on individual voters, who may or may not be persuad-ed, but on the political environment as a whole?</p>

<p>The practice of political strategists selling candidates as brands is not new. Vance Packard wrote about the 'depth probing' techniques of 'political persuaders' as early as 1957. In his book, 'The Hidden Persuaders', Packard described political strategies designed to sell candidates to voters 'like toothpaste', and how public relations directors at the time boasted that 'scientific methods take the guesswork out of politics'.5 In this sense, what we have now is a logical progression of the digitisation of marketing techniques and political persuasion techniques.</p></blockquote>

	    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@chrisbuetti/how-i-eat-for-free-in-nyc-using-python-automation-artificial-intelligence-and-instagram-a5ed8a1e2a10">This</a> is a fascinating hack:</p>

<blockquote><p>In today's digital age, a large Instagram audience is considered a valuable currency. I had also heard through the grapevine that I could monetize a large following -- or in my desired case -- use it to have my meals paid for. <i>So I did just that</i>.

<p>I created an Instagram page that showcased pictures of New York City's skylines, iconic spots, elegant skyscrapers Â­-- you name it. The page has amassed a following of over 25,000 users in the NYC area and it's still rapidly growing.</p>

<p>I reach out restaurants in the area either via Instagram's direct messaging or email and offer to post a positive review in return for a free entree or at least a discount. Almost every restaurant I've messaged came back at me with a compensated meal or a gift card. Most places have an allocated marketing budget for these types of things so they were happy to offer me a free dining experience in exchange for a promotion. I've ended up giving some of these meals away to my friends and family because at times I had too many queued up to use myself.</p>

<p>The beauty of this all is that <b>I automated the whole thing</b>. And I mean 100% of it. I wrote code that finds these pictures or videos, makes a caption, adds hashtags, credits where the picture or video comes from, weeds out bad or spammy posts, posts them, follows and unfollows users, likes pictures, monitors my inbox, and most importantly -- both direct messages and emails restaurants about a potential promotion. Since its inception, I haven't even really logged into the account. I spend zero time on it. It's essentially a robot that operates like a human, but the average viewer can't tell the difference. And as the programmer, I get to sit back and admire its (and my) work.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much going on in this project.</p>

	    <p>Yet another side-channel attack on smartphones: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11137">Hearing your touch: A new acoustic side channel on smartphones</a>," by Ilia Shumailov, Laurent Simon, Jeff Yan, and Ross Anderson.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present the first acoustic side-channel attack that recovers what users type on the virtual keyboard of their touch-screen smartphone or tablet. When a user taps the screen with a finger, the tap generates a sound wave that propagates on the screen surface and in the air. We found the device's microphone(s) can recover this wave and "hear" the finger's touch, and the wave's distortions are characteristic of the tap's location on the screen. Hence, by recording audio through the built-in microphone(s), a malicious app can infer text as the user enters it on their device. We evaluate the effectiveness of the attack with 45 participants in a real-world environment on an Android tablet and an Android smartphone. For the tablet, we recover 61% of 200 4-digit PIN-codes within 20 attempts, even if the model is not trained with the victim's data. For the smartphone, we recover 9 words of size 7-13 letters with 50 attempts in a common side-channel attack benchmark. Our results suggest that it not always sufficient to rely on isolation mechanisms such as TrustZone to protect user input. We propose and discuss hardware, operating-system and application-level mechanisms to block this attack more effectively. Mobile devices may need a richer capability model, a more user-friendly notification system for sensor usage and a more thorough evaluation of the information leaked by the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>Kaspersky Labs is <a href="https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/">reporting</a> on a new supply chain attack they call "Shadowhammer."</p>

<blockquote><p>In January 2019, we discovered a sophisticated supply chain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility. The attack took place between June and November 2018 and according to our telemetry, it affected a large number of users. 

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, which were identified by their network adapters' MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses in the trojanized samples and this list was used to identify the actual intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique MAC addresses from over 200 samples used in this attack. Of course, there might be other samples out there with different MAC addresses in their list.</p>

<p>We believe this to be a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses <a href="https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/">the Shadowpad</a> and the <a href="https://blog.avast.com/update-to-the-ccleaner-5.33.6162-security-incident">CCleaner</a> incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed with legitimate certificates (eg: "ASUSTeK Computer Inc."). The malicious updaters were hosted on the official liveupdate01s.asus[.]com and liveupdate01.asus[.]com ASUS update servers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sophistication of the attack leads to the speculation that a nation-state -- and one of the cyber powers -- is responsible.</p>

<p>As I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/05/supply-chain_se.html">previously written</a>, supply chain security is "an incredibly complex problem." These attacks co-opt the very mechanisms we need to trust for our security. And the international nature of our industry results in an array of vulnerabilities that are very hard to secure.</p>

<p>Kim Zetter has a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers">really good article</a> on this.

	    <p>A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-shows-programmers-will-take-the-easy-way-out-and-not-implement-proper-password-security/">university study</a> confirmed the obvious: if you pay a random bunch of freelance programmers a small amount of money to write security software, they're not going to do a very good job at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>In an experiment that involved 43 programmers hired via the Freelancer.com platform, University of Bonn academics have discovered that developers tend to take the easy way out and write code that stores user passwords in an unsafe manner.

<p>For their study, the German academics asked a group of 260 Java programmers to write a user registration system for a fake social network.</p>

<p>Of the 260 developers, only 43 took up the job, which involved using technologies such as Java, JSF, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL to create the user registration component.</p>

<p>Of the 43, academics paid half of the group with â¬100, and the other half with â¬200, to determine if higher pay made a difference in the implementation of password security features.</p>

<p>Further, they divided the developer group a second time, prompting half of the developers to store passwords in a secure manner, and leaving the other half to store passwords in their preferred method -- hence forming four quarters of developers paid â¬100 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P100), developers paid â¬200 and prompted to use a secure password storage method (P200), devs paid â¬100 but not prompted for password security (N100), and those paid â¬200 but not prompted for password security (N200).</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't know why anyone would expect this group of people to implement a good secure password system. Look at how they were hired. Look at the scope of the project. Look at what they were paid. I'm sure they grabbed the first thing they found on GitHub that did the job.</p>

<p>I'm not very impressed with the study or its conclusions.</p>

	    <p>Not email, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/nyregion/mailbox-theft-fishing.html">paper mail</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thieves, often at night, use string to lower glue-covered rodent traps or bottles coated with an adhesive down the chute of a sidewalk mailbox. This bait attaches to the envelopes inside, and the fish in this case -- mail containing gift cards, money orders or checks, which can be altered with chemicals and cashed -- are reeled out slowly.</p></blockquote>

<p>In response, the US Post Office is introducing a more secure mailbox:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mail slots are only large enough for letters, meaning sending even small packages will require a trip to the post office. The opening is also equipped with a mechanism that grabs at a letter once inserted, making it difficult to retract.</p></blockquote>

<p>The crime has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/nyregion/new-york-ny-mailbox-theft.html">more common</a> in the past few years.</p>

	    <p>From the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/science/squid-camouflage-colors.html">New York Times</a></i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08891-x">a paper published last week in Nature Communications</a> suggests that their chromatophores, previously thought to be mainly pockets of pigment embedded in their skin, are also equipped with tiny reflectors made of proteins. These reflectors aid the squid to produce such a wide array of colors, including iridescent greens and blues, within a second of passing in front of a new background. The research reveals that by using tricks found in other parts of the animal kingdom -- like shimmering butterflies and peacocks -- squid are able to combine multiple approaches to produce their vivid camouflage.</p></blockquote>

	    <p>This is an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/how-microsoft-found-a-huawei-driver-that-opened-systems-up-to-attack/">interesting story</a> of a serious vulnerability in a Huawei driver that Microsoft found. The vulnerability is similar in style to the NSA's DOUBLEPULSAR that was leaked by the Shadow Brokers -- believed to be the Russian government -- and it's obvious that this attack copied that technique.</p>

<p>What is less clear is whether the vulnerability -- which has been fixed -- was put into the Huwei driver accidentally or on purpose.</p>

</p>
<p>I have another set of questions.</p>

<p>This vulnerability was discovered thank to Microsoft ATP, which uses specific monitorings inside windows kernel. </p>

<p>Can any other vendor perform the same? Or is the Kernel locked to Microsoft?</p>

<p>If locked, from a security standpoint is it better (only Microsoft can alter the kernel with caution and serious security process and review) or worse (in this field the innovation is reduced to Microsoft goodwill and ideas)?<br />

</p>
<p>Process explorer shows that Microsoft allows for extensive Monitoring by userspace programs. </p>

<p>If locking down something is good or bad for security I don't know: the one who gives you the monitoring data might hide anything he wants. Not giving access to monitoring data means nearly anyone can hide his actions but if you allow to monitor things someone might use this data for spying on you in spectre-like days.</p>

<p>@Bruce Schneier:</p>

<p>"What is less clear is whether the vulnerability -- which has been fixed -- was put into the Huwei driver accidentally or on purpose."</p>

<p>Or by whom and under what chain of authority.</p>

<p>There is also the question of 'When' as well.</p>

<p>As the article notes,</p>

<p>"'It also highlights just some of the extraordinarily awful things that hardware vendors do when they're tasked with writing software. When your hardware vendors are opening up big security flaws and copying malware techniques, one wonders if we need protection from the good guys as well as the bad ones.'"</p>

<p>Much of this 'awfulness' stems directly from the way the MicroSoft OS works and alows unknown, unchecked code into and below the kernel and it's limited security provisions.</p>

<p>We do and have for quite sometime know of better ways to do this. Which are both more efficient and secure. However doing things that way would but a bit of a major hole in what MicroSoft's 'telemetry' can more covertly get it's hands on.</p>

<p>I think i add here this new CCDCoE Huawei raport.<br />
(otherwise planned to put it into the squid)</p>

<p>I'm confused about this. Wasn't DOUBLEPULSAR a malware implant - NOT a vulnerability? Did Huawei drivers come with an implant?</p>

<p>Also, "believed to be the Russian Government" - I've seen this opinion on primarily this blog and some forums but I've also run into lots of other theories and nothing - so far - close to conclusive. The blog post makes it sound like there's a good consensus in the community. Has more definitive information come out?</p>

<p>OT, but</p>

<p>Running TENS (not deluxe) 1.7.5, in Virtual Box, User Agent- Windows/FF, w/NoScript, Plug-Ins (never activate),<br />
gives you a relatively common, w/Panopticlick, browser; ~ 1 in 7k</p>

<p>The United States have been trying hard to discredit chinese manufacturers, starting with Lenovo years ago.  There had been a high pressure from the U.S. against European Union countries on this matter recently.</p>

<p>May it be a false flag operation against Huawei customers?</p>

<p>I would not discard a non-appropriately protected development server at Huawei being attacked to introduce this code.</p>

<p>"Security" has been long used as a pretext to achieve another goals,<br />
money, power, position, economical edge, shutting down the opposition etc, you name it.</p>

<p>I'm quite happy with my Huawei router.</p>

BTW, this being April 1, I note that many entities evidently still observe April Fools Day, and I wonder if there remains any real point in doing so. IMO - on the internet, every day is April Fools...</p>

<p>How the heck does a vulnerability get put in accidentally?  I can understand the Chicoms wanting a backdoor access to routers which makes a claim of "Opps! It was an accident" even less believable.<br />

<p>> How the heck does a vulnerability get put in accidentally?</p>

<p>The same way the vast majority of bugs get into software?</p>
