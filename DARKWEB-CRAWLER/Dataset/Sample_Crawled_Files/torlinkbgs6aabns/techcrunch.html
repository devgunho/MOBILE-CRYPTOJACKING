				<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers have revealed details of a vulnerability in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> security that could be used to compromise the secrecy of encrypted group chats on the messaging platform.</p>
<p>The risk associated with the flaw is limited on account of attackers needing to have access to WhatsApp servers to be able to insert themselves into a group conversation.</p>
<p>That said,Â <a target="_blank" href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/10/04/uk-gives-whatsapp-another-spanking-over-e2e-crypto/" rel="noopener">WhatsApp does continue to face pressure from governments</a> over its use of <a target="_blank" href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/we-want-to-limit-use-of-e2e-encryption-confirms-uk-minister/" rel="noopener">end-to-end encryption</a>. So any vulnerability that could even <em>theoretically</em> offer a route for the company to be coerced by state entities to collaborate with their agents to afford a degree of access to encrypted conversations is worth highlighting.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-security-flaws-encryption-group-chats/" rel="noopener">WiredÂ </a>reports that the encryption flaws, which were detailed today at the Real World Crypto security conference in Zurich, Switzerland, by a group of researchers from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, also affect the Signal and Threema messaging apps &#8212; though to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>Regarding WhatsApp, the researchers say that anyone who controls WhatsApp&#8217;s servers could insert new participants into an otherwise private group without having the permission of the group administrator.</p>
<p>The attack apparently takes advantage of a bug in how WhatsApp handles group chats &#8212; in that while only the administrator of a group can invite new members the platform does not use any authentication mechanism for an invitation that its own servers cannot spoof.</p>
<p>Once an attacker with access to a WhatsApp server had added a new member to a group the phone of every participant would automatically share secret keys with that new member &#8212; affording them full access to any future messages. (Though messages sent prior to them joining the group would remain unreadable.)</p>
<p>And while everyone in the chat would be notified that a new member has joined, it would likely be up to the administrator to notice and call out a spoofed invite (since they are the users capable of creating invite links).</p>
<p>The researchers also suggest that an attacker with access to WhatsApp servers could selectively block any messages in the group &#8212; closing down the ability of group participants to ask questions, or provide warnings about the interloper.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, a WhatsApp spokesman confirmed the security researchers&#8217; findings but said it views the risk as limited because no one can secretly join a WhatsApp group chat &#8212; meaning users can always chat one-to-one to confirm any suspicions about unknown members appearing in their groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve looked at this issue carefully,&#8221; a spokesman told us. &#8220;Existing members are notified when new people are added to a WhatsApp group. We built WhatsApp so group messages cannot be sent to a hidden user. The privacy and security of our users is incredibly important to WhatsApp. It&#8217;s why we collect very little information and all messages sent on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team of security researchers, who revealed the flaw to WhatsApp last July, suggest the company could fix the issue by adding an authentication mechanism for new group invitations that uses a secret key that only the administrator possesses to sign those invitations.</p>
<p>Such added authentication layers would likelyÂ made it impossible for WhatsApp to provide group invite links which allow people to quickly add new members to a group &#8212; which explains why the company is reluctant to change the system it has in place, despite the apparent element of risk.</p>
<p>It also points out that WhatsApp users are able to view the membership of a group by tapping &#8216;group info&#8217;, and can verify the security code of individual members for added security.</p>
<p>For the Signal messaging app, which uses the same underlying encryption protocol as WhatsApp, the security researchers found the app contains the same group chat vulnerability but further mitigated by an attacker not only having to controlÂ the relevant Signal server but also having to know the Group ID number for the chat (and these IDs are essentially unguessable).</p>
<p>Open Whisper Systems, the non-profit which runs and maintains Signal, is also apparently in the process of redesigning how Signal handles group messaging.</p>
<p>A third encrypted messaging app, Threema, which was also shown to contain some more minor bugs relating to group chats by the researchers, has already put out aÂ fix to patch its software.</p>
<p>Last <a target="_blank" href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/01/13/encrypted-messaging-platform-whatsapp-denies-backdoor-claim/" rel="noopener">January</a> another security issue relating to WhatsApp&#8217;s platform was <a target="_blank" href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/01/13/encrypted-messaging-platform-whatsapp-denies-backdoor-claim/" rel="noopener">highlighted</a>Â after a security researcher showed it was possible toÂ force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users &#8212; reigniting debate over how key verification is implementedÂ within an encrypted system. However WhatsApp said the âretransmission vulnerabilityâ was an intentional design decision aimed at avoiding millions of messages from being lost.</p>
<p>It also pointed out that users can opt to âShow Security Notificationsâ &#8212; which provides them with a notification when a contactâs security codeÂ has changed, and thus offers an alert when/if thereâs a risk of theirÂ messages being man-in-the-middle intercepted.</p>

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/whatsapp\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"whatsapp\">WhatsApp&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> security that could be used to compromise the secrecy of encrypted group chats on the messaging platform.<\/p>\n<p>The risk associated with the flaw is limited on account of attackers needing to have access to WhatsApp servers to be able to insert themselves into a group conversation.<\/p>\n<p>That said,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/04\/uk-gives-whatsapp-another-spanking-over-e2e-crypto\/\" rel=\"noopener\">WhatsApp does continue to face pressure from governments<\/a> over its use of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/05\/we-want-to-limit-use-of-e2e-encryption-confirms-uk-minister\/\" rel=\"noopener\">end-to-end encryption<\/a>. So any vulnerability that could even <em>theoretically<\/em> offer a route for the company to be coerced by state entities to collaborate with their agents to afford a degree of access to encrypted conversations is worth highlighting.<\/p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/whatsapp-security-flaws-encryption-group-chats\/\" rel=\"noopener\">Wired\u00a0<\/a>reports that the encryption flaws, which were detailed today at the Real World Crypto security conference in Zurich, Switzerland, by a group of researchers from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, also affect the Signal and Threema messaging apps &#8212; though to a lesser degree.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding WhatsApp, the researchers say that anyone who controls WhatsApp&#8217;s servers could insert new participants into an otherwise private group without having the permission of the group administrator.<\/p>\n<p>The attack apparently takes advantage of a bug in how WhatsApp handles group chats &#8212; in that while only the administrator of a group can invite new members the platform does not use any authentication mechanism for an invitation that its own servers cannot spoof.<\/p>\n<p>Once an attacker with access to a WhatsApp server had added a new member to a group the phone of every participant would automatically share secret keys with that new member &#8212; affording them full access to any future messages. (Though messages sent prior to them joining the group would remain unreadable.)<\/p>\n<p>And while everyone in the chat would be notified that a new member has joined, it would likely be up to the administrator to notice and call out a spoofed invite (since they are the users capable of creating invite links).<\/p>\n<p>The researchers also suggest that an attacker with access to WhatsApp servers could selectively block any messages in the group &#8212; closing down the ability of group participants to ask questions, or provide warnings about the interloper.<\/p>\n<p>Reached for comment, a WhatsApp spokesman confirmed the security researchers&#8217; findings but said it views the risk as limited because no one can secretly join a WhatsApp group chat &#8212; meaning users can always chat one-to-one to confirm any suspicions about unknown members appearing in their groups.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve looked at this issue carefully,&#8221; a spokesman told us. &#8220;Existing members are notified when new people are added to a WhatsApp group. We built WhatsApp so group messages cannot be sent to a hidden user. The privacy and security of our users is incredibly important to WhatsApp. It&#8217;s why we collect very little information and all messages sent on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The team of security researchers, who revealed the flaw to WhatsApp last July, suggest the company could fix the issue by adding an authentication mechanism for new group invitations that uses a secret key that only the administrator possesses to sign those invitations.<\/p>\n<p>Such added authentication layers would likely\u00a0made it impossible for WhatsApp to provide group invite links which allow people to quickly add new members to a group &#8212; which explains why the company is reluctant to change the system it has in place, despite the apparent element of risk.<\/p>\n<p>It also points out that WhatsApp users are able to view the membership of a group by tapping &#8216;group info&#8217;, and can verify the security code of individual members for added security.<\/p>\n<p>For the Signal messaging app, which uses the same underlying encryption protocol as WhatsApp, the security researchers found the app contains the same group chat vulnerability but further mitigated by an attacker not only having to control\u00a0the relevant Signal server but also having to know the Group ID number for the chat (and these IDs are essentially unguessable).<\/p>\n<p>Open Whisper Systems, the non-profit which runs and maintains Signal, is also apparently in the process of redesigning how Signal handles group messaging.<\/p>\n<p>A third encrypted messaging app, Threema, which was also shown to contain some more minor bugs relating to group chats by the researchers, has already put out a\u00a0fix to patch its software.<\/p>\n<p>Last <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2017\/01\/13\/encrypted-messaging-platform-whatsapp-denies-backdoor-claim\/\" rel=\"noopener\">January<\/a> another security issue relating to WhatsApp&#8217;s platform was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2017\/01\/13\/encrypted-messaging-platform-whatsapp-denies-backdoor-claim\/\" rel=\"noopener\">highlighted<\/a>\u00a0after a security researcher showed it was possible to\u00a0force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users &#8212; reigniting debate over how key verification is implemented\u00a0within an encrypted system. However WhatsApp said the \u201cretransmission vulnerability\u201d was an intentional design decision aimed at avoiding millions of messages from being lost.<\/p>\n<p>It also pointed out that users can opt to \u201cShow Security Notifications\u201d &#8212; which provides them with a notification when a contact\u2019s security code\u00a0has changed, and thus offers an alert when\/if there\u2019s a risk of their\u00a0messages being man-in-the-middle intercepted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Security researchers have revealed details of a vulnerability in WhatsApp&#8217;s security that could be used to compromise the secrecy of encrypted group chats on the messaging platform.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":39990176,"featured_media":1302574,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[5082865,4984696,3684903,3692158,3697736,4273458],"relegenceSubjects":[978794,980487,980524,982665,983462,6359463,983052,981073],"jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[449557100,21587494,3457,17396],"tags":[8159,6474,576601849,147292,130206974,20650,25699058],"crunchbase_tag":[202275447],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/whatsappcomplete2.png","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"shortlink":"http:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2Fn7cjK","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"whatsapp","cb_name":"WhatsApp","cb_slug":"whatsapp-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/whatsapp"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[39990176],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"relatedArticles":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1585399"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"version-history":[{"count":12,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1585399\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1585472,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1585399\/revisions\/1585472"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/39990176"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1585399&order=asc&tc_hierarchical=flat"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=1585399&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/39990176"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1302574"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1585399"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1585399"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1585399"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=1585399"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=1585399"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=1585399"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":39990176,"name":"Natasha Lomas","url":"","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/natasha-lomas\/","slug":"natasha-lomas","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/68a02f90ad0a6349a7b852ddce6f93e4?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/68a02f90ad0a6349a7b852ddce6f93e4?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/68a02f90ad0a6349a7b852ddce6f93e4?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/riptari","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nlomas","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/natasha-lomas"},"position":"Writer","cbDescription":"<p>Natasha is a senior reporter for TechCrunch, joining September 2012, based in Europe.

				<p id="speakable-summary">In another blow to the UK government&#8217;s record on bulk data handling for intelligence purposes the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that state surveillance practices violated human rights law.</p>
<p>Arguments against the UK intelligence agencies&#8217; bulk collection and data sharing practices were heard by the court in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/07/uk-bulk-spying-challenge-in-european-court-of-human-rights/">November last year</a>.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s ruling the ECHR has ruled that only some aspects of the UK&#8217;s surveillance regime violate human rights law. So it&#8217;s not all bad news for the government &#8212; which has faced a barrage of legal actions (and quite a few black marks against its spying practices in recent years) ever since its love affair with mass surveillance was revealed and denounced by NSA whistleblower <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/edward-snowden" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="edward-snowden">Edward Snowden, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> back in 2013.</p>
<p>The judgement reinforces a sense that the government has been seeking to push as close to the legal line as possible on surveillance, and sometimes stepping over it &#8212; reinforcing earlier strikes against legislation for not setting tight enough boundaries to surveillance powers, and likely providing additional fuel for fresh challenges.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The complaints before the ECHRÂ focused on three different surveillance regimes: 1) The bulk interception of communications (aka &#8216;mass surveillance&#8217;); 2) Intelligence sharing with foreign governments; and 3) The obtaining of communications data from communications service providers.</p>
<p>The challenge actually combines three cases, with the action brought by a coalition of civil and human rights campaigners, including the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/american-civil-liberties-union" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="american-civil-liberties-union">American Civil Liberties Union, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amnesty-international" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amnesty-international">Amnesty International, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Big Brother Watch, Liberty, Privacy International and nine other human rights and journalism groups based in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>The Chamber judgment from the ECHR found, by a majority of five votes to two, that the UK&#8217;s bulk interception regime violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (a right to respect for private and family life/communications) &#8212; on the grounds that &#8220;t<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">here was insufficient oversight both of the selection of Internet bearers for interception and the filtering; search and selection of intercepted communications for examination; and the safeguards governing the selection of &#8216;related communications data&#8217; for examination were inadequate&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>The judges did not find bulk collection itself to be in violation of the convention but noted that such a regime must respect criteria set down in case law.</p>
<p>In an even more pronounced majority vote, the Chamber found by six votes to one that the UK government&#8217;s regime for obtaining data from communications service providers violated Article 8 as it was &#8220;not in accordance with the law&#8221;.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>While both the bulk interception regime and the regime for obtaining communications data from communications service providers were deemed to have violated Article 10 of the Convention (the right to freedom of expression and information,) as the judges found there were insufficient safeguards in respect of confidential journalistic material.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However the Chamber did not rule against the government in two other components of the case &#8212; finding that<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Â the regime for sharing intelligence with foreign governments did not violate either Article 8 or Article 10.</span></p>

<p>While the court unanimously rejected complaints made by the third set of applicants, under Article 6 (right to a fair trial), about the domestic procedure for challenging secret surveillance measures, and under Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).</p>

<p>The complaints in this case were lodged prior to the UK legislating for a new surveillance regime, the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, so in coming to a judgement the Chamber was considering the oversight regime at the time (and in the case of points 1 and 3 above that&#8217;s the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000).</p>
<p>RIPA has since been superseded by IPA but, as noted above, today&#8217;s ruling will likely fuel ongoing human rights challenges to the latter &#8212; which the government has already been ordered to amend by other courts on human rights grounds.</p>
<p>Nor is it the only UK surveillance legislation judged to fall foul on that front. A few years ago UK judges agreed with a similar legal challenge to emergency surveillance legislation that predates IPA &#8212; ruling in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/17/u-k-emergency-surveillance-law-ruled-unlawful-by-high-court/">2015</a> that DRIPA was unlawful under human rights law. A verdict the UK Court of Appeal agreed with, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/uk-keeps-up-its-legal-losing-streak-over-mass-surveillance/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Also in 2015 the intelligence agencies&#8217; own oversight court, the IPT, also found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/u-k-spy-oversight-court-rules-gchq-acted-unlawfully-again/">multiple</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/06/ipt-nsa-gchq-ruling/">violations</a> following challenges to aspects of its historical surveillance operations, after they have been made public by the Snowden revelations.</p>
<p>SuchÂ judgements did not stop the government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/uk-parliament-rubberstamps-mass-surveillance-law/">pushing on with the IPA</a>, though &#8212; and it went on to cement bulk collection at the core of its surveillance modus operandi at the end of 2016.</p>
<p>Among the most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption/">controversial elements of the IPA</a>Â is a requirement that communications service providers collect and retain logs on the web activity of the digital services accessed by all users for 12 months; stateÂ powerÂ <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/07/15/uk-surveillance-bill-includes-powers-to-limit-end-to-end-encryption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to require a company to remove encryption</a>, or limit the rollout of end-to-end encryption on a future service; and<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Â state powers to hack devices, networks and services, includingÂ </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/uk-faces-human-rights-challenge-to-states-bulk-hacking-abroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bulk hacking</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Â on foreign soil. It also allows the security agencies to maintainÂ </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/isc-report-privacy-and-security-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large databases of personal information on U.K. citizens</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">,Â including individualsÂ suspected of no crime.</span></p>
<p>On the safeguards front the government legislated for what it claimed was aÂ âdouble lockâ authorization process for interception warrants &#8212; which loops in the judiciary to signing off intercept warrants for the first time in the U.K., along with senior ministers. However this does not regulate the collection or accessing of web activity data that&#8217;s blanket-retained on all users.</p>
<p>InÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/uk-mass-surveillance-regime-dealt-another-blow-in-court/">April</a> this shiny new surveillance regime was also dealt a blow in UK courts &#8212; with judges ordering the government to amend the legislation to narrow how and why retained metadata could be accessed, giving ministers a deadline of November 1 to make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>In that case the judges also did not rule against bulk collection in general &#8212; declining to find that the state&#8217;s current data retention regime is unlawful on the grounds that it constituted âgeneral and indiscriminateâ retention of data. (For its part the government has always argued its bulk collection activities do not constituteÂ blanket retention.)</p>
<p>And today&#8217;s ECHR ruling further focuses attention on the safeguards placed <em>around</em> bulk collection programs &#8212; having found the UK regime lacked sufficient monitoring to be lawful (but not that bulk collection itself is unlawful by default).</p>
<p>Opponents of the current surveillance regime will be busily parsing the ruling to find fresh fronts to attack.</p>

<p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time the ECHR has looked at bulk interception. Most recently, in June 2018, it deemed Swedish legislation and practice in the field of signals intelligence did not violate EU human rights law. Among its reasoning was that it found the Swedish system to have provided &#8220;adequate and sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse&#8221;.</p>
<p>However it said the Big Brother Watch and Others vs United Kingdom case being ruled upon today is the first case in which it specifically considered the extent of the interference with a personâs private life that could result from the interception and examination of communications data (as opposed to content).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Press_Q_A_Brother_Watch_ENG.pdf">Q&amp;A</a> about today&#8217;s judgement, the court notes that it &#8220;expressly recognised&#8221; the severity of threats facing states,Â and also how advancements in technology have &#8220;made it easier for terrorists and criminals to evade detection on the Internet&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It therefore held that States should enjoy a broad discretion in choosing how best to protect national security. Consequently, a State may operate a bulk interception regime if it considers that it is necessary in the interests of national security. That being said, the Court could not ignore the fact that surveillance regimes have the potential to be abused, with serious consequences for individual privacy. In order to minimise this risk, the Court has previously identified six minimum safeguards which all interception regimes must have,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The safeguards are that the national law must clearly indicate: the nature of offences which may give rise to an interception order; a definition of the categories of people liable to have their communications intercepted; a limit on the duration of interception; the procedure to be followed for examining, using and storing the data obtained; the precautions to be taken when communicating the data to other parties; and the circumstances in which intercepted data may or must be erased or destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Additional elements the court says it considered in an earlier surveillance case, Roman Zakharov v. Russia, also to determine whether legislation breached Article 8, included &#8220;arrangements for supervising the implementation of secret surveillance measures, any notification mechanisms and the remedies provided for by national law&#8221;.)</p>
<p>Commenting on today&#8217;s ruling in a statement,Â Megan Goulding, a lawyer for Liberty, said: &#8220;This is a major victory for the rights and freedom of people in the UK. It shows that there is &#8212; and should be &#8212; a limit to the extent that states can spy on their citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Police and intelligence agencies need covert surveillance powers to tackle the threats we face today &#8212; but the court has ruled that those threats do not justify spying on every citizen without adequate protections.Â Our government has built a surveillance regime more extreme than that of any other democratic nation, abandoning the very rights and freedoms terrorists want to attack.Â It can and must give us an effective, targeted system that protects our safety, data security and fundamental rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Liberty spokeswoman also told us it will continue its challenge to IPA in the UK High Court, adding: &#8220;We continue to believe that mass surveillance can never be compliant in a free, rights-respecting democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also commenting in a statement,Â Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said:Â âThis landmark judgment confirming that the UKâs mass spying breached fundamental rights vindicates Mr Snowdenâs courageous whistleblowing and the tireless work of Big Brother Watch and others in our pursuit for justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the guise of counter-terrorism, the UK has adopted the most authoritarian surveillance regime of any Western state, corroding democracy itself and the rights of the British public. This judgment is a vital step towards protecting millions of law-abiding citizens from unjustified intrusion. However, since the new Investigatory Powers Act arguably poses an ever greater threat to civil liberties, our work is far from over.â</p>
<p>A spokesperson for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/privacy-international" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="privacy-international">Privacy International <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told us it&#8217;s considering taking the case to the ECHR&#8217;s Grand Chamber.</p>
<p>Also commenting in a supporting statement, Antonia Byatt, director of English PEN, added: &#8220;This judgment confirms that the British governmentâs surveillance practices have violated not only our right to privacy, but our right to freedom of expression too. Excessive surveillance discourages whistle-blowing and discourages investigative journalism. The government must now take action to guarantee our freedom to write and to read freely online.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Home Office for comment from the UK government.</p>
<p>On intelligence sharing between governments, which the court had not previously considered, the judges found thatÂ <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the procedure for requesting either the interception or the conveyance of intercept material from foreign intelligence agencies to have been set out with &#8220;sufficient clarity in the domestic law and relevant code of practice&#8221;, noting:Â </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In particular, material from foreign agencies could only be searched if all the requirements for searching material obtained by the UK security services were fulfilled.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also found &#8220;no evidence of any significant shortcomings in the application and operation of the regime, or indeed evidence of any abuse&#8221; &#8212; hence finding theÂ </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">intelligence sharing regime did not violate Article 8.</span></p>
<p>On the portion of the challenge concerning complaints that UK intelligence agencies&#8217; oversight court, the IPT,Â <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">lacked independence and impartiality, the court disagreed &#8212; finding that the tribunal had &#8220;extensive power to consider complaints concerning wrongful interference with communications, and those extensive powers had been employed in the applicantsâ case to ensure the fairness of the proceedings&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Most notably, the IPT had access to open and closed material and it had appointed Counsel to the Tribunal to make submissions on behalf of the applicants in the closed proceedings,&#8221; it also writes.</span></p>
<p>In addition, it said it accepted the government&#8217;s argument that in order toÂ <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ensure the efficacy of the secret surveillance regime restrictions on the applicantsâ procedural rights had been &#8220;both necessary and proportionate and had not impaired the essence of their Article 6 rights&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On the complaints under Article 14, in conjunction with Articles 8 and 10 &#8212; that those outside the UK were disproportionately likely to have their communications intercepted as the law only provided additional safeguards to people known to be in Britain &#8212; the court also disgareed,Â </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">rejecting this complaint as manifestly ill-founded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The applicants had not substantiated their argument that people outside the UK were more likely to have their communications intercepted. In addition, any possible difference in treatment was not due to nationality but to geographic location, and was justified,&#8221; it writes.Â </span></p>

intelligence purposes the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that state surveillance practices violated human rights law.<\/p>\n<p>Arguments against the UK intelligence agencies&#8217; bulk collection and data sharing practices were heard by the court in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/07\/uk-bulk-spying-challenge-in-european-court-of-human-rights\/\">November last year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s ruling the ECHR has ruled that only some aspects of the UK&#8217;s surveillance regime violate human rights law. So it&#8217;s not all bad news for the government &#8212; which has faced a barrage of legal actions (and quite a few black marks against its spying practices in recent years) ever since its love affair with mass surveillance was revealed and denounced by NSA whistleblower <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/edward-snowden\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> back in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>The judgement reinforces a sense that the government has been seeking to push as close to the legal line as possible on surveillance, and sometimes stepping over it &#8212; reinforcing earlier strikes against legislation for not setting tight enough boundaries to surveillance powers, and likely providing additional fuel for fresh challenges.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The complaints before the ECHR\u00a0focused on three different surveillance regimes: 1) The bulk interception of communications (aka &#8216;mass surveillance&#8217;); 2) Intelligence sharing with foreign governments; and 3) The obtaining of communications data from communications service providers.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge actually combines three cases, with the action brought by a coalition of civil and human rights campaigners, including the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/american-civil-liberties-union\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"american-civil-liberties-union\">American Civil Liberties Union, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amnesty-international\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amnesty-international\">Amnesty International, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Big Brother Watch, Liberty, Privacy International and nine other human rights and journalism groups based in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas.<\/p>\n<p>The Chamber judgment from the ECHR found, by a majority of five votes to two, that the UK&#8217;s bulk interception regime violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (a right to respect for private and family life\/communications) &#8212; on the grounds that &#8220;t<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">here was insufficient oversight both of the selection of Internet bearers for interception and the filtering; search and selection of intercepted communications for examination; and the safeguards governing the selection of &#8216;related communications data&#8217; for examination were inadequate&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The judges did not find bulk collection itself to be in violation of the convention but noted that such a regime must respect criteria set down in case law.<\/p>\n<p>In an even more pronounced majority vote, the Chamber found by six votes to one that the UK government&#8217;s regime for obtaining data from communications service providers violated Article 8 as it was &#8220;not in accordance with the law&#8221;.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>While both the bulk interception regime and the regime for obtaining communications data from communications service providers were deemed to have violated Article 10 of the Convention (the right to freedom of expression and information,) as the judges found there were insufficient safeguards in respect of confidential journalistic material.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>However the Chamber did not rule against the government in two other components of the case &#8212; finding that<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0the regime for sharing intelligence with foreign governments did not violate either Article 8 or Article 10.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>While the court unanimously rejected complaints made by the third set of applicants, under Article 6 (right to a fair trial), about the domestic procedure for challenging secret surveillance measures, and under Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The complaints in this case were lodged prior to the UK legislating for a new surveillance regime, the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, so in coming to a judgement the Chamber was considering the oversight regime at the time (and in the case of points 1 and 3 above that&#8217;s the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000).<\/p>\n<p>RIPA has since been superseded by IPA but, as noted above, today&#8217;s ruling will likely fuel ongoing human rights challenges to the latter &#8212; which the government has already been ordered to amend by other courts on human rights grounds.<\/p>\n<p>Nor is it the only UK surveillance legislation judged to fall foul on that front. A few years ago UK judges agreed with a similar legal challenge to emergency surveillance legislation that predates IPA &#8212; ruling in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/07\/17\/u-k-emergency-surveillance-law-ruled-unlawful-by-high-court\/\">2015<\/a> that DRIPA was unlawful under human rights law.

(For its part the government has always argued its bulk collection activities do not constitute\u00a0blanket retention.)<\/p>\n<p>And today&#8217;s ECHR ruling further focuses attention on the safeguards placed <em>around<\/em> bulk collection programs &#8212; having found the UK regime lacked sufficient monitoring to be lawful (but not that bulk collection itself is unlawful by default).<\/p>\n<p>Opponents of the current surveillance regime will be busily parsing the ruling to find fresh fronts to attack.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The battle moves on now to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/libertyhq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@libertyhq<\/a>\u2019s litigation challenging the current Snoopers Charter &#8211; the Investigatory Powers Act. Many of the legal flaws slammed in today\u2019s decision are baked into that law. The wind is in our sails today.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Corey Stoughton (@CoreyStoughton) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CoreyStoughton\/status\/1040170939835658241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 13, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the first time the ECHR has looked at bulk interception. Most recently, in June 2018, it deemed Swedish legislation and practice in the field of signals intelligence did not violate EU human rights law. Among its reasoning was that it found the Swedish system to have provided &#8220;adequate and sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>However it said the Big Brother Watch and Others vs United Kingdom case being ruled upon today is the first case in which it specifically considered the extent of the interference with a person\u2019s private life that could result from the interception and examination of communications data (as opposed to content).<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.echr.coe.int\/Documents\/Press_Q_A_Brother_Watch_ENG.pdf\">Q&amp;A<\/a> about today&#8217;s judgement, the court notes that it &#8220;expressly recognised&#8221; the severity of threats facing states,\u00a0and also how advancements in technology have &#8220;made it easier for terrorists and criminals to evade detection on the Internet&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It therefore held that States should enjoy a broad discretion in choosing how best to protect national security. Consequently, a State may operate a bulk interception regime if it considers that it is necessary in the interests of national security. That being said, the Court could not ignore the fact that surveillance regimes have the potential to be abused, with serious consequences for individual privacy. In order to minimise this risk, the Court has previously identified six minimum safeguards which all interception regimes must have,&#8221; it writes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The safeguards are that the national law must clearly indicate: the nature of offences which may give rise to an interception order; a definition of the categories of people liable to have their communications intercepted; a limit on the duration of interception; the procedure to be followed for examining, using and storing the data obtained; the precautions to be taken when communicating the data to other parties; and the circumstances in which intercepted data may or must be erased or destroyed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(Additional elements the court says it considered in an earlier surveillance case, Roman Zakharov v. Russia, also to determine whether legislation breached Article 8, included &#8220;arrangements for supervising the implementation of secret surveillance measures, any notification mechanisms and the remedies provided for by national law&#8221;.)<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on today&#8217;s ruling in a statement,\u00a0Megan Goulding, a lawyer for Liberty, said: &#8220;This is a major victory for the rights and freedom of people in the UK. It shows that there is &#8212; and should be &#8212; a limit to the extent that states can spy on their citizens.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Police and intelligence agencies need covert surveillance powers to tackle the threats we face today &#8212; but the court has ruled that those threats do not justify spying on every citizen without adequate protections.\u00a0Our government has built a surveillance regime more extreme than that of any other democratic nation, abandoning the very rights and freedoms terrorists want to attack.\u00a0It can and must give us an effective, targeted system that protects our safety, data security and fundamental rights.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A Liberty spokeswoman also told us it will continue its challenge to IPA in the UK High Court, adding: &#8220;We continue to believe that mass surveillance can never be compliant in a free, rights-respecting democracy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Also commenting in a statement,\u00a0Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said:\u00a0\u201cThis landmark judgment confirming that the UK\u2019s mass spying breached fundamental rights vindicates Mr Snowden\u2019s courageous whistleblowing and the tireless work of Big Brother Watch and others in our pursuit for justice.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Under the guise of counter-terrorism, the UK has adopted the most authoritarian surveillance regime of any Western state, corroding democracy itself and the rights of the British public. This judgment is a vital step towards protecting millions of law-abiding citizens from unjustified intrusion. However, since the new Investigatory Powers Act arguably poses an ever greater threat to civil liberties, our work is far from over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/privacy-international\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"privacy-international\">Privacy International <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> told us it&#8217;s considering taking the case to the ECHR&#8217;s Grand Chamber.<\/p>\n<p>Also commenting in a supporting statement, Antonia Byatt, director of English PEN, added: &#8220;This judgment confirms that the British government\u2019s surveillance practices have violated not only our right to privacy, but our right to freedom of expression too. Excessive surveillance discourages whistle-blowing and discourages investigative journalism. The government must now take action to guarantee our freedom to write and to read freely online.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Home Office for comment from the UK government.<\/p>\n<p>On intelligence sharing between governments, which the court had not previously considered, the judges found that\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">the procedure for requesting either the interception or the conveyance of intercept material from foreign intelligence agencies to have been set out with &#8220;sufficient clarity in the domestic law and relevant code of practice&#8221;, noting:\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;In particular, material from foreign agencies could only be searched if all the requirements for searching material obtained by the UK security services were fulfilled.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">It also found &#8220;no evidence of any significant shortcomings in the application and operation of the regime, or indeed evidence of any abuse&#8221; &#8212; hence finding the\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">intelligence sharing regime did not violate Article 8.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the portion of the challenge concerning complaints that UK intelligence agencies&#8217; oversight court, the IPT,\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">lacked independence and impartiality, the court disagreed &#8212; finding that the tribunal had &#8220;extensive power to consider complaints concerning wrongful interference with communications, and those extensive powers had been employed in the applicants\u2019 case to ensure the fairness of the proceedings&#8221;. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;Most notably, the IPT had access to open and closed material and it had appointed Counsel to the Tribunal to make submissions on behalf of the applicants in the closed proceedings,&#8221; it also writes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition, it said it accepted the government&#8217;s argument that in order to\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">ensure the efficacy of the secret surveillance regime restrictions on the applicants\u2019 procedural rights had been &#8220;both necessary and proportionate and had not impaired the essence of their Article 6 rights&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">On the complaints under Article 14, in conjunction with Articles 8 and 10 &#8212; that those outside the UK were disproportionately likely to have their communications intercepted as the law only provided additional safeguards to people known to be in Britain &#8212; the court also disgareed,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">rejecting this complaint as manifestly ill-founded. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;The applicants had not substantiated their argument that people outside the UK were more likely to have their communications intercepted.

				<p id="speakable-summary">A watchlist of risky individuals and corporate entities owned by Dow Jones has been exposed, after a company with access to the database left it on a server without a password.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mayhemdayone?lang=en">Bob Diachenko</a>, an independent security researcher, found the Amazon Web Services-hosted Elasticsearch database exposing more than 2.4 million records of individuals or business entities.</p>
<p>The data, since secured, is the financial giant&#8217;s Watchlist database, which companies use as part of their risk and compliance efforts. Other financial companies, like Thomson Reuters, have <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/world-check-financial-crime-and-terrorism-database-leaked/">their own databases</a> of high-risk clients, politically exposed persons and terrorists â but have <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-the-global-terrorism-blacklist-secretly-shadowing-millions-of-suspects/">also been exposed over the years</a> through separate security lapses.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5753295-2010-brochure-on-Dow-Jones-Watchlist.html">2010-dated brochure</a> billed the Dow Jones Watchlist as allowing customers to &#8220;easily and accurately identify high-risk clients with detailed, up-to-date profiles&#8221; on any individual or company in the database. At the time, the database had 650,000 entries, the brochure said.</p>
<p>That includes current and former politicians, individuals or companies under sanctions or convicted of high-profile financial crimes such as fraud, or anyone with links to terrorism. Many of those on the list include &#8220;special interest persons,&#8221; according to the records in the exposed database seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Diachenko, who <a href="https://securitydiscovery.com/dow-jones-risk-screening-watchlist-exposed-publicly">wrote up his findings</a>, said the database was &#8220;indexed, tagged and searchable.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1789772" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1789772" class="breakout wp-image-1789772" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png" alt="" width="900" height="474" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png 1976w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=768,404 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1789772" class="wp-caption-text">From a 2010-dated brochure of Dow Jones&#8217; Watchlist, which at the time had 650,000 names of individuals and entities. The exposed database had 2.4 million records. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>The data is all collected from public sources, such as news articles and government filings. Many of the individual records were sourced from Dow Jones&#8217; Factiva news archive, which ingests data from many news sources â including the Dow Jones-owned The Wall Street Journal. But the very inclusion of a person or company&#8217;s name, or the reason why a name exists in the database, is proprietary and closely guarded.</p>
<p>Many financial institutions and government agencies use the database to approve or deny financing, or even in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33677946">the shuttering of bank accounts</a>, the BBC previously reported. Others have reported that it can <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/06/23/flimsy-evidence-and-fringe-sources-land-people-on-secretive-banking-watch-list/">take little or weak evidence</a> to land someone on the watchlists.</p>
<p>The records we saw vary wildly, but can include names, addresses, cities and their location, whether they are deceased or not and, in some cases, photographs. Diachenko also found dates of birth and genders. Each profile had extensive notes collected from Factiva and other sources.</p>
<p>One name found at random was Badruddin Haqqani, a commander in the Haqqani guerilla insurgent network in Afghanistan affiliated with the Taliban. In 2012, the U.S. Treasury <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1584.aspx">imposed sanctions</a> on Haqqani and others for their involvement in financing terrorism. He was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan months later.</p>
<p>The database record on Haqqani, who was categorized under &#8220;sanctions list&#8221; and terror,&#8221; included (and condensed for clarity):</p>
<blockquote><p><code>DOW JONES NOTES:<br />
</code><code>Killed in Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal area on 21-Aug-2012.</code></p>
<p><code>OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC) NOTES:</code></p>
<p><code>Eye Color Brown; Hair Color Brown; Individual's Primary Language Pashto; Operational Commander of the Haqqani Network</code></p>
<p><code>EU NOTES:</code></p>
<p><code>Additional information from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:</code></p>
<p><code>Badruddin Haqqani is the operational commander for the Haqqani Network, a Taliban-affiliated group of militants that operates from North Waziristan Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. The Haqqani Network has been at the forefront of insurgent activity in Afghanistan, responsible for many high-profile attacks. The Haqqani Network's leadership consists of the three eldest sons of its founder Jalaluddin Haqqani, who joined Mullah Mohammed Omar's Taliban regime in the mid-1990s. Badruddin is the son of Jalaluddin and brother to Nasiruddin Haqqani and Sirajuddin Haqqani, as well as nephew of Khalil Ahmed Haqqani.</code></p>
<p><code>Badruddin helps lead Taliban associated insurgents and foreign fighters in attacks against targets in south- eastern Afghanistan. Badruddin sits on the Miram Shah shura of the Taliban, which has authority over Haqqani Network activities.</code></p>
<p><code>Badruddin is also believed to be in charge of kidnappings for the Haqqani Network. He has been responsible for the kidnapping of numerous Afghans and foreign nationals in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.</code></p>
<p><code>UN NOTES:</code></p>
<p><code>Other information: Operational commander of the Haqqani Network and member of the Taliban shura in Miram Shah. Has helped lead attacks against targets in southeastern Afghanistan. Son of Jalaluddin Haqqani (TI.H.40.01.). Brother of Sirajuddin Jallaloudine Haqqani (TI.H.144.07.) and Nasiruddin Haqqani (TI.H.146.10.). Nephew of Khalil Ahmed Haqqani (TI.H.150.11.). Reportedly deceased in late August 2012.</code></p>
<p><code>FEDERAL FINANCIAL MONITORING SERVICES NOTES:</code></p>
<p><code>Entities and individuals against whom there is evidence of involvement in terrorism.<br />

<p>Dow Jones spokesperson Sophie Bent said: &#8220;This dataset is part of our risk and compliance feed product, which is entirely derived from publicly available sources.&#8221; The spokepserson said an &#8220;authorized third party&#8221; was to blame for the exposure, but did not name the alleged company or provide evidence for the claim.</p>
<p>We asked Dow Jones specific questions, such as who the source of the data leak was and if the exposure would be reported to U.S. regulators and European data protection authorities, but the company would not comment on the record.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Dow Jones admitted <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/cloud-leak-dow-jones">a similar cloud storage misconfiguration</a> exposed the names and contact information of 2.2 million customers, including subscribers of The Wall Street Journal. The company described the event as an &#8220;error.&#8221;</p>

secured, is the financial giant&#8217;s Watchlist database, which companies use as part of their risk and compliance efforts. Other financial companies, like Thomson Reuters, have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/world-check-financial-crime-and-terrorism-database-leaked\/\">their own databases<\/a> of high-risk clients, politically exposed persons and terrorists \u2014 but have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/inside-the-global-terrorism-blacklist-secretly-shadowing-millions-of-suspects\/\">also been exposed over the years<\/a> through separate security lapses.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/5753295-2010-brochure-on-Dow-Jones-Watchlist.html\">2010-dated brochure<\/a> billed the Dow Jones Watchlist as allowing customers to &#8220;easily and accurately identify high-risk clients with detailed, up-to-date profiles&#8221; on any individual or company in the database. At the time, the database had 650,000 entries, the brochure said.<\/p>\n<p>That includes current and former politicians, individuals or companies under sanctions or convicted of high-profile financial crimes such as fraud, or anyone with links to terrorism. Many of those on the list include &#8220;special interest persons,&#8221; according to the records in the exposed database seen by TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Diachenko, who <a href=\"https:\/\/securitydiscovery.com\/dow-jones-risk-screening-watchlist-exposed-publicly\">wrote up his findings<\/a>, said the database was &#8220;indexed, tagged and searchable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1789772\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1789772\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1789772\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png 1976w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=150,79 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=300,158 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=768,404 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=680,358 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-27-at-12.58.24-PM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1789772\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From a 2010-dated brochure of Dow Jones&#8217; Watchlist, which at the time had 650,000 names of individuals and entities. The exposed database had 2.4 million records. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The data is all collected from public sources, such as news articles and government filings. Many of the individual records were sourced from Dow Jones&#8217; Factiva news archive, which ingests data from many news sources \u2014 including the Dow Jones-owned The Wall Street Journal. But the very inclusion of a person or company&#8217;s name, or the reason why a name exists in the database, is proprietary and closely guarded.<\/p>\n<p>Many financial institutions and government agencies use the database to approve or deny financing, or even in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/magazine-33677946\">the shuttering of bank accounts<\/a>, the BBC previously reported. Others have reported that it can <a href=\"https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2017\/06\/23\/flimsy-evidence-and-fringe-sources-land-people-on-secretive-banking-watch-list\/\">take little or weak evidence<\/a> to land someone on the watchlists.<\/p>\n<p>The records we saw vary wildly, but can include names, addresses, cities and their location, whether they are deceased or not and, in some cases, photographs. Diachenko also found dates of birth and genders. Each profile had extensive notes collected from Factiva and other sources.<\/p>\n<p>One name found at random was Badruddin Haqqani, a commander in the Haqqani guerilla insurgent network in Afghanistan affiliated with the Taliban. In 2012, the U.S. Treasury <a href=\"https:\/\/www.treasury.gov\/press-center\/press-releases\/Pages\/tg1584.aspx\">imposed sanctions<\/a> on Haqqani and others for their involvement in financing terrorism. He was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan months later.<\/p>\n<p>The database record on Haqqani, who was categorized under &#8220;sanctions list&#8221; and terror,&#8221; included (and condensed for clarity):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><code>DOW JONES NOTES:<br \/>\n<\/code><code>Killed in Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal area on 21-Aug-2012.<\/code><\/p>\n<p><code>OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC) NOTES:<\/code><\/p>\n<p><code>Eye Color Brown; Hair Color Brown; Individual's Primary Language Pashto; Operational Commander of the Haqqani Network<\/code><\/p>\n<p><code>EU NOTES:<\/code><\/p>\n<p><code>Additional information from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:<\/code><\/p>\n<p><code>Badruddin Haqqani is the operational commander for the Haqqani Network, a Taliban-affiliated group of militants that operates from North Waziristan Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. The Haqqani Network has been at the forefront of insurgent activity in Afghanistan, responsible for many high-profile attacks. The Haqqani Network's leadership consists of the three eldest sons of its founder Jalaluddin Haqqani, who joined Mullah Mohammed Omar's Taliban regime in the mid-1990s. Badruddin is the son of Jalaluddin and brother to Nasiruddin Haqqani and Sirajuddin Haqqani, as well as nephew of Khalil Ahmed Haqqani.<\/code><\/p>\n<p><code>Badruddin helps lead Taliban associated insurgents and foreign fighters in attacks against targets in south- eastern Afghanistan.
