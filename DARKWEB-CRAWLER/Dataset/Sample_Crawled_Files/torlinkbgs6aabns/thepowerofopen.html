	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	The world has experienced an explosion of openness. From individual
	artists opening their creations for input from others, to governments
	requiring publicly funded works be available to the public, both the spirit
	and practice of sharing is gaining momentum and producing results.
	</p><p>
	Creative Commons began providing licenses for the open sharing of
	content only a decade ago. Now more than 400 million CC-licensed works
	are available on the Internet, from music and photos, to research findings
	and entire college courses. Creative Commons created the legal and
	technical infrastructure that allows effective sharing of knowledge, art and
	data by individuals, organizations and governments. More importantly,
	millions of creators took advantage of that infrastructure to share work
	that enriches the global commons for all humanity.
	</p><p>
	<i>The Power of Open</i> collects the stories of those creators. Some are like
	ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative news organization that
	uses CC while partnering with the worldâs largest media companies. Others
	like nomadic filmmaker Vincent Moon use CC licensing as an essential
	element of a lifestyle of openness in pursuit of creativity. The breadth of
	uses is as great as the creativity of the individuals and organizations choosing
	to open their content, art and ideas to the rest of the world.
	</p><p>
	As we look ahead, the field of openness is approaching a critical mass of
	adoption that could result in sharing becoming a default standard for the
	many works that were previously made available only under the
	all-rights-reserved framework. Even more exciting is the potential
	increase in global welfare from the use of Creative Commonsâ tools and
	the increasing relevance of openness to the discourse of culture, education
	and innovation policy.
	</p><p>
	We hope that <i>The Power of Open</i> inspires you to examine and embrace the
	practice of open licensing so that your contributions to the global
	intellectual commons can provide their greatest benefit to all people.
