<div class="mirror"><!-- Obviously, all the "mirror" divs and spans are for the mirror site -->
<p>This page is a mirror of the former content of <a href="http://www.geohot.com/">http://www.geohot.com/</a> as at 26 January 2011, removed following a Sony lawsuit. All content outside of the black areas is from George Hotz, not me. His original site now contains details of the unjust lawsuit against him, which was settled on 11 April 2011.</p>
<!-- <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>NEW 2012-10-25!</strong></span> Here is the announcement by The Three Musketeers on 22 October 2012 of their leak of the <a href="lv0.txt">PlayStation 3 bootldr keys</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><strong>UPDATED 2012-10-25!</strong></span> The first binary download site for Mr Wicked's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sacd-ripper/">SACD Ripper</a>. This is what PS3 homebrew is all about: using the PS3 for legitimate purposes that Sony would never allow &ndash; format-shifting from the dying SACD medium to open file formats playable on commodity PCs.  Download <a href="sacd-ripper.pkg">beta version 0.21</a> (r275) which works stand-alone, or <a href="sacd_daemon.pkg">version 0.30</a> (r315) now called sacd-daemon, which works over a network with companion client software <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sacd-ripper/downloads/list">SACD Extract</a>. You will also need a recent custom firmware such as <a href="http://wiki.gitbrew.org/index.php/PS3:OtherOS++">OtherOS++</a> and the <a href="ps3free-ps3keys-master.tar.gz">PS3 root keys</a>.</p>
<p>I am also mirroring the <a href="coolstuff.rar">PS3 hypervisor reverse-engineering bible</a> (warning, 160Mb) released by another hacker, Graf Chokolo, after his <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20036111-245.html">house was raided by Sony.</p> -->

props to fail0verflow for the asymmetric half<br/>
no donate link, just use this info wisely<br/>
i do not condone piracy<br/>
<br/>
<span class="old";>if you want your next console to be secure, get in touch with me. any of you 3.<br/>

it'd be fun to be on the other side.<br/><br/>

...and <a href="geohot_1st.self">this</a> is a real self, hello world<br/>
although it's not NPDRM, so it won't run off the hard drive<br/>
shouts to the guys who did PSL1GHT<br/>
without you, I couldn't release this<br/>
<br/>
<a href="Lv2diag.self">first</a> piece of homebrew you can run<br/>

put in service mode, put on usb stick, boot</span> <span class="mirror"><a href="#note2">[1]</a></span><br/><br/>

I made a <!-- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqk4F5eBvrI"> --><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6wOsN6uKRE">video</a> <span class="mirror"><a href="#note3">[2]</a></span><br/><br/>
<em><b>it's <a href="/jailbreak.zip">jailbreak</a> time</b></em><br/>
open the zip, you know how to install<br/>
3.55 only<br/>
would be pirates, don't waste your time<br/>
do not mirror file, link to geohot.com <span class="mirror"><a href="#note4">[3]</a></span><br/>
no donations accepted right now, don't get scammed<br/><br/>
homebrew signing <span class="old";><a href="ps3publictools_release.zip">tools</a> and </span><!-- <a href="https://github.com/geohot/ps3publictools"> --><a href="https://github.com/imhospb/ps3publictools">source</a> <span class="mirror"><a href="#note5">[4]</a></span><br/>
make_self_npdrm makes valid NPDRM selfs from elfs<br/>
it does not contain any info on decrypting or removing NPDRM<br/>
NPDRM is required for interoperability of our homebrew applications<br/>
package_finalize turns your debug packages into psuedoretail packages<br/>
psuedoretail packages install on a geohot jailbroken PS3<br/><br/>
i'm excited to see what you will create<br/>

<p><a name="note2"></a>[1] This grey text is from an earlier version of the Web site, as at 4 January. Although it shows George in a less favourable light, it is important because Sony has used it against him in their lawsuit.</p>
<p><a name="note3"></a>[2] The YouTube video link, which is now private, has been replaced with another YouTube user's copy, and for good measure we have a <a href="Jailbroken PS3 3.55 with Homebrew.mp4">local copy</a> too.</p>
<p><a name="note4"></a>[3] Actually <i>do</i> mirror widely... but be careful.</p>
<p><a name="note5"></a>[4] The github repository linked from the original page is down; so the "source" link now goes to a fork of it. A <a href="ps3publictools_source.zip">zipfile</a> of that repository is also available just in case. The greyed-out tools link was only online for a few days, between about 8 and 11 January.</p>
<!-- <p>To contact me (not geohot), email <s>wdnqg3ehh3hvalpe at tormail.net</s>* (easy to remember, as it's the same as the hostname of this site). My Bitcoin address for donations is 1C9KqYU8DC3dCfKPctT3RdcbGJpx6abYKn.</p>
<p>* As at 4 August 2013, tormail has been compromised and is down.</p> -->
