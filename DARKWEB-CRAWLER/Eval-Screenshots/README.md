## Evaluation Metrics
* Evaluating the correctness of the retrieved documents given a query is a challenge as there are no Gold Standards / True Labels
* Annotating them is not an option because we do not have domain experts to annotate them into the correct fields
* Getting a 100% recall is more of a priority than improving Accuracy or Precision of the retrieval (more is fine, but not missing any is the goal)
* The main aim of the project is to create and index a dataset related to hacking tools which can be used to prevent attacks and used by researchers to further explore the domain

## Issues and challenges
* Not all website content is in English -> hard to search through/for
* A lot of .onion websites that were found were already shut down
* Some crawled files flagged by anti-virus and put into quarantine
* And obviously the security

## Future Work
* Parse the data into a better format before indexing for better results...
